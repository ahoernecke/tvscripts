You know you want to. - Of course I want to, but-- - It's gonna be a good one. - I can feel it. - It's always good. Still-- If you're not gonna come over, do you want me to talk you through it? It's tempting, but I think I'll watch "ER" here. Another night alone with my clicker. Is that what the kids are calling it? So I went back to the sale today. - Did you get that black flowy thing? - No, you were right. It's too Stevie Nicks, the heavy years. Eriq La Salle just smiled. - Really? - No. - Did you buy anything? - Yeah, I got a great camisole. - Sexy? - Man: I'm going to sleep. Ask me in the morning. - Was that Danny? - Yeah, jealous? Honey, I don't need your man. I got George Clooney. Sorry, babe, he doesn't bat for your team. Well, he hasn't seen me pitch. Okay. Say, "Good night, Gracie." Good night, Gracie. It's to you, Jack. Give me a minute, please? Okay? A room without windows A room without doors It's to you, Jack. Give me a minute, please? Wow! A room where no guy but I can spy that No-ooo, not gonna risk it this time. Four cards, please. Here's my ace. Jack, now that you're moving in, can I make one small request? What's that? Change everything about your personality. I get it, comedy. You didn't tell me Jack was moving in with you. Not moving in, he's just staying until his apartment's finished. - ( humming ) - Oh, I know that one-- I know-- Did he need a stronger hand? -  Did he need a - Jack! He's not humming your intro. That's just a straight guy's way of thinking that you and I could ever be a couple. Okay, first of all: Will should only be so lucky. So let's just clear that right up. Second of all: you don't even know me that well. Why would you just assume that I was gay? I finished. Okay, FYl, folks, most people that meet me do not know that I am gay. Jack, blind and deaf people know you're gay. Dead people know you're gay. - Do we play poker? - Yes. Come on, who's in? I'm in for 10. I'm fine. Keep playing. Oh look, it's Sporty Spice. Did you and Danny have a fight? Yeah, but I don't wanna talk about it right now. - I can't even think straight. - That's funny, neither can Jack. Grace, did you know I was gay when you met me? My dog knew. So the fabrics never came in, and I wasn't able to make the presentation. Diamond lnteriors got the job. - I'm sorry. What a disappointment. - Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear, but Danny said, "When you put everything off till the last minute" - Eew. - Yeah. And I lost it. I started screaming, "Why can't you just let me have my feelings?" Grace, that is so Barbara DeAngelis, "Making Love Work." - I know, wasn't it? - Yeah. And then he says-- get this, "You don't have to get hysterical. You sound just like your mother." If you were on "Jerry Springer," that's the minute you'd jump out of your chair. Can you believe that? You're staying here tonight. Go wash your face, I'll make up your bed. "You sound just like your mother." What kind of person says that? The kind of person you should've dumped a year ago. - What? - I said, I hear they're re-releasing "Vertigo." "You sound just like your mother." When you wanna push someone's buttons, that'll do it. Hey, roomie! Jack, you can't move in tonight. What? Grace is very upset. I told her she could stay here tonight. - You move in tomorrow, okay? - Okay, that's interesting. You'd think maybe you could have told me this-- oh I don't know-- before I packed up my entire life! You don't understand, Grace has had a really-- what's in the hat box? Your tiara? Look, Guapo, he made a funny. Shut up, Will! I just schlepped all the way over here from the East Side, and you know how much Guapo hates riding in taxis. Okay. Okay, take it easy, Jack. You sound just like your mother. Crossing the line. You nasty, bitter, lonely, balding man. I don't need this crap from you, Will. You know what? I just don't need it. - What time tomorrow? - Eightish. Fine. You're my lawyer. You tell me. What have I got to do to buy this company? First, we've gotta get something called, the "Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust" clearance, and then we can negotiate standstills and lock ups, Naturally, that's after we do due diligence. What the hell is "do-do diligence?" No, Harlan, after we do due diligence. Doesn't matter how slow you say it, it's still "do-do", isn't it? - I just wanna know what it means. - It's crap that lawyers deal with. Harlan, I'll handle it. I've been representing your corporation for five years now, remember? I know, but my wife's been bugging me about the business. She wants me to be a little more hands-on. You sure she's talking about the business? Yeah, she's talking about the business. But I trust you, Will, so you do that "do-do" that you do so well. - ( intercom buzzes ) - Woman: Will, it's Grace on line one. Hey. Can I stay at your apartment again tonight? Of course, as long as you want. - What are you doing? - I'm looking for tissues. Have your assistant get them for you. - She's late again. - Fire her already. I'm not gonna fire Karen. Her social contacts keep my business afloat. Why does she even work? Isn't she worth like a gazillion dollars? She feels working keeps her down to earth. I know, I'm late. My driver had another bronchial incident. It was disgusting. I had to raise the partition. But that's no excuse, I should be punished. I'm writing you a check. Karen, tell Grace she should fire you. Grace, tell Will to redirect his anger at his mother, where it belongs. - Call me later. - Bye. All right, honey. There you go. Guilt be gone. Karen, I don't want a check. I want assistance. I'm the boss, I give you checks. Yes you do, honey, and I love them, I do. I keep them all right here in this box. So, what else? - Danny and I got into a fight. - Oh, honey, call him and make up. Why would I do that? It wasn't my fault. In the long run, it doesn't matter. I don't know that there's gonna be a long run. Grace, you're-- you're what? 40? I'll be 31 next month. So I rounded up. Danny is a good catch. You've been living together for a year. Close the deal already. ( phone ringing ) I'm serious Grace, pick up the pace. I'm serious, Karen, pick up the phone. So, Will, have you seen Michael since you two broke up? No, he hasn't, but I have. Michael's not doing well. He got fat, he's depressed. Cheap haircuts, not good. Actually, it's very sad. What are you talking about? I just saw him. Looks great. Rob, you're dismissed. - Thanks for trying, sweetie. - His haircut really was awful. I know. I think it's time for "$25,000 Pyramid." - Rob: Hello! - Woman: All right! So, Will, are you gonna keep the place? I thought it was gonna be a little too expensive, - so I told Jack-- oh no. - ( knock on door ) Hi, honey, I'm home. - Are we entertaining? Welcome. - Jack, I meant to call you today-- - Don't even! - Wait, wait. I can stay at Rob and Ellen's tonight. No, you can't, Grace, because apparently, you matter. How about that? Jack, I am so sorry. I just-- Are bandanas back in? 'Cause I didn't get that memo. Ha, ha-ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Let me tell you something, Will Truman, I don't need to live here, all right? And you know what? Guess who loses? Hello! You do. Because I could have turned you into a human being instead of this rude, self-absorbed, getting-chunkier-every-day-- oops, did that slip out? --thing that you are. - What time tomorrow? - Eightish. Fine. Let's play "The Pyramid." - Ellen: Okay, you two first. - Okay, you give, I'll receive. Just as God intended it. - Ellen's timing. - Got it. Here's your first subject. Go! Okay, okay. Driftwood. John Wayne. - You're parents' marriage. - Things that are dead. Yes. My one-night stand on Fire lsland. - Latin things. - Good. The postcard I sent you from ltaly. "Everybody Hurts" by REM. - Things that make you cry. - Yes. - Professor Gopnik's teeth. - Things that are yellow. Yes. - A cane. A railing. - Come on, give me another clue. Each other. - Things that you lean on. - That's it. Yeah! You guys-- that was amazing. Grace, you and Danny never do this well when we play. I know. I'm gonna break up with him. It's just time. My relationship has reached a fork in the road, and ending it with Danny is the right-- prong. Excuse me. Things that bring a dinner party to a crashing halt? - So, how'd it go? - Not like I thought. Gracie, I'm sorry. You give it some time-- No, Will, he proposed. - Grace Adler Design? - Oh, my God, would you look at that? Who in the world would be sending-- Oh, carnations, they must be for you. Yep, they're from Danny. Isn't he a sweetheart? Oh my. Well. Surprised you're still walking. Give me that. He is so great. I can't believe I ever doubted he was the one. Bon appétit. What am I gonna do about Grace? What's the big deal? Why don't you-- could I get a skotch more gravy? It's a little dry. If you don't like Danny, just tell her it's a bad idea. I don't tell people who to marry. Okay, you always tell me what you think of the men I date. I'm talking about marriage, not Rudy the Jewish cowboy you met on the internet. Shalom, my lonesome prairie dog. She's your best friend, Will. You have to tell her what you think. - Be honest. - I can't. Before my brother married Ginny, he asked me what I honestly thought of her. I told him, she's morose, and controlling, and icy. They got married anyway. Now she hates me and my brother and I don't talk. I couldn't handle losing Grace like that. I'm gonna call Rudy again. Oh, God, I'm sorry, but more importantly, that's terrible about you and your brother. It's awful. No, no, no. Do you have any mineral water? Sulfites. When are you moving in? I'm gonna be away on business for a while and-- What business? Business. I have business, and clients and work-related-- business. How is the work-related client business these days? What is this? Why do you have to be so mean? Because you love it. And I love you, and you love gel. And you have a home here when you get back. You can be a very great guy when you wanna be. Well, I gotta be nicer to you. - Yes, you do. - Because you are a good friend. - Yes, I am. - I know it's gotta be rough on you. - Will, don't. - Being trapped in a man's body like that. - Hi. - Hey. - What are you watching? - "Pop-Up Video" Turns out, Fiona Apple doesn't particularly like apples. Apple Brown Betty was invented by a guy named Darren, and get this, Bobby Darren's dog was named Fiona. What are the odds of that? - I said, "Yes." - What? I said, "Yes." Oh my God. Oh my God! Come here! Wow. Let's have a look at that ring. It's beautiful. When is the stone being put in? I knew you were gonna say that. Wow You know, I'm thirsty. What? What? What? I'm happy for you. Lying. Lying man talking. Grace, stop it. I am happy for you. I want you two to have a great life together. You do? Thank God. I was so worried coming over here. So I have your blessing then? Yes. - I love you. - Love you. Okay! - I've gotta go tell my family. - Grace, don't. I have to, Will, they're paying. No, I mean, don't marry Danny. What? Honey, I gotta be honest. This guy's not enough for you. You're passionate, and you're creative, and beautiful, and perfect, and this guy-- you should be with someone more-- somebody else. He's not funny. He doesn't know what your favorite flower is. He's passive-aggressive. The man high-five's you after sex. You're so afraid you're never gonna get married you can't even see how wrong he is for you. Think about it. If you really believed he was the one, would you be asking me for my blessing? Go to hell, Will. No, Rosario, por favor, honey, listen to me for a second, okay? Take Olivia and Mason to la store de los toys. - Where's Grace? - Oh, honey, thank God. How do you say toy store in Spanish? - Tienda de juguetes. - Uh-huh, thanks. F-A-O-yeah-Schwartzo. Si, si, Rosario, gracias. Hola. I haven't slept. I can't get any work done. Where is she? Will, just stop right there. I cannot tell you anything, it's a secret. - What is? - She's at City Hall getting married. Oh, devil. What? What about the big wedding? She thought it was best to get it over with quickly, not to make a big to-do, and I say "Brava!" - Grace-- - Oh, look who's here. - I'm sorry. - It's a little late for that. No, I'm here, Grace. I'm here to support your marriage. - There is no marriage. - What? There is no marriage! And you wanna know why? Because my best friend-- that would be the part you're supposed to play-- my best friend dropped a bomb of poo on my head. Oh, honey, l-- I was fine. I was getting married, and then you come along. You come and you poison-- with the-- with the thorns from the-- the flower-- I had this metaphor worked out earlier, but I'm just very upset right now. Gracie, I just want you to be happy. No, Will, you want me to be alone like you. - Is that the way you see this? - Yes. It's interesting, because I never thought of myself as being alone. Well that was a little harsh. Good. Yes, yes it is. He's a bad person, very bad. Grace, I think it's time for a couple of blue bippies. - I don't want any pills. - They're not for you, they're for me. Marriage is-- what? Marriage is-- marriage is. Okay? What the hell, that's all you need to-- Grace? She's gone. She's gone, and I'm sitting here talking to myself like a crazy person. Oh my God, listen to me, I'm still doing it. Will, I am-- I am so sorry for what I said back there. I know. It was mean, but-- I know. This morning, on the way to the ceremony, Danny looked at me and said, "I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you." And I turned to him and said, "You know the limo has a phone?" It wasn't right. He was a smart attractive man who loved me, and who I loved, by the way. Why wasn't it right? Sweetie, remember in college we saw that French film about a man and a woman that were perfect for one another, but they kept missing each other. And in the last scene, they meet on a plane, because that's the way it was destined to be. Remember? And you said, "That's gonna be me." Gracie, you're just in the middle of your movie. Danny was a plot point. A nice, decent, postcoital high-fiving plot point. There's still time. Go get some Raisinettes. - I like Red Vines. - Whatever you want. The point is, it's not over if your movie's gonna have a happy ending. - You just have to see it through. - Oh God. - Come here. - Huh-uh. What do you say we go get a drink? Yes-ss. - What is with that dress? - Give me a break. - I had five minutes to prepare for this. - Still. What are we to toast to your lovely new bride? All: Yeah! Here's to the ball and chain. If she makes it through the night, ba-bing, I think I'll keep her. Wait, my turn. To my Will. You are my hero, and my soul mate. And I'm a better woman for loving you. All: Oo-ooh! Hey, hey, hey Come on, you two. - How's about a kiss? - All: Yeah! All: Kiss, kiss, kiss - Nothing? Anything? - Sorry, no, it's--   
                




                    			And then Regis looked right into the camera, and said, "Just give her the damn Emmy already." No, La Lucci, he didn't say "her," he said, "Give La Lucci the damn Emmy." Right, right, right, La Lucci. Do it. Do Regis. "Give La Lucci the damn Emmy already." Now do Regis finding out he has a week to live. Grace, no bad taste. And I need some time to work on that one. So you're seeing apartments today? Do Regis after he's had too much melon. - Stalling. - Not stalling. Grace, you haven't even been looking at apartments. So not true. Look, there's one now. There's one and there's one. Danny gets back to town in a week. You need to move out of his apartment, and away from "ex-boyfriend land." - I hate "ex-boyfriend land." - So start fresh. When Michael left me, I completely changed the whole apartment. Will, your apartment is exactly the same. The point is, you need a new place. It's easy for you to say, Mr. Rent Control, Mr. View-of-the-Park, Mr. Perfect Apartment. Oh my God. Why don't I move in with you? - Wow! - Huh? Can't, because I promised Jack he could stay with me. Just till his floors are done. Excuse me? How brilliant is this? I love you, you love me, and I love the fact I won't have to pretend I'm looking for apartments. Okay, let me think about this. No! I love you, but no, no, Grace, we need to have our own apartments. - Why? - Because, we're grown-ups. Aren't we? What just happened? We were having fun, we were playing Regis, and suddenly I'm supposed to grow up, get my own place, - and pay bills? I hate you. - No, you don't. Look, I gotta get to work, and you have got to start looking for a new apartment. Go. Go, you big grown-up. As Regis: "What do mean I only have a week to live? What am I gonna tell Gelman?" Ah-hh. Oh, it all began with just one little dance But soon it ended up a big romance Blame it on the Bossa Nova The dance of love. I made it myself. It's a dry snack mix. I call it "garlic jazz." I think you might like it, but if you don't, Blame it on the Bossa Nova Knock it off. Don't make me laugh. You're bugging me. Okay, how am I bugging you? How about projectile "garlic jazz" all over my $4,000 sofa? Each time you describe the sofa you add another thousand. ( Guapo squawking ) Must you always let that bird out of it's cage? Hey, birds gotta fly, fish gotta swim. Will's gotta lighten up. Sorry, Jack, I didn't get much sleep. You were on the phone till 4:00am. I could hear you gushing three rooms away. For your information, I was having a heart-to-heart call with someone who actually cares about me. Nobody actually cares about you at Dial-a-Dude. I don't know what you're talking about. It's $2.99 a minute. And so not worth it. Jack McFarland, you are a frustrating roommate. You make expensive phone calls, but you don't pay the bills. You eat a lot, but you never cook. You put on a maid's uniform, but you never clean the house. Okay, what is this? What's with the vertical eyebrows? - You and Grace get in a fight? - No, we did not get in a fight. She wants to move in. And I said no. And I might have been a little insensitive. Do I have "garlic jazz" breath? That's right, I forgot, it's always about you. Why are you so angry? Why don't you tell me what this is really about? Oh my God. You're in love with me, aren't you? Do you smell toast? Because I think you're having a stroke. All I'm saying is, you're a realtor. Let's get a little real. Who can afford-- no, no, no don't hang up, please. I'm sorry. I'll have my assistant fax over the application. It's gonna cost me a muffin basket. Oh my God, I already have this. Well, so now I have two. I could live with my sister for a few months. I could also shove bamboo under my fingernails. Now this is something, "I got it so I'll have it. And maybe I'll wear it, and maybe I won't." But maybe I will. Whoop! Last month I had a fiance, and a two-bedroom apartment. Next month, single and homeless. Right on track. Okay, now this is just fun. It's "Beach, cocktails with the Pearlmanns, kicky little blouse, cheeriness." Dick's gotta stop drinking. Do you also hold up sandwiches in front of starving children? Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I'm being insensitive. I should really-- do you want a blouse? No, thank you. I want an apartment. Can you please fax this application over to the realtor? Oh, honey. Machinery, no. Why do you have to be the one to move out in the first place? It's the break-up rule. Whoever cancels the marriage is forced to wander the streets of New York without a place to plug in her hot rollers. Honey, you know that Danny would take you back in a heartbeat. I'm not gonna marry someone just because I want a nice apartment. Yes, that would be wrong. It would be settling. - I wanna marry the one. - And well you should, honey. How else are you gonna get to the two and the three? That's too much money to pay for any Ho. Okay, here, charming one-bedroom, Chelsea adjacent, well-maintained, 1,500. Sounds great. Okay, let me decode. Charming: tiny. Chelsea adjacent: New Jersey. Well-maintained: super washes blood off sidewalk daily. You're not helping. This is for you. Okay, fine, fine. Let me see. Okay? Oh my God. Oh my God, here it is. Perfect. Upper West Side, spacious two-bedroom, - two-bath, fireplace - This is great. hardwood floors, terrace, beautifully decorated by talented woman who hates looking for apartments, gay best friend included. Ha-ha! - Grace, you can't move in with me. - Why not? - Because, you know it's a bad idea. - I don't know that, you know that. I hate when people say, I know that. How would I know that? Let's go over the reasons why you shouldn't. Reason #1 : you just got out of a relationship, and you need to wipe the slate clean. Okay. Reason #1 why I should: I would never let you walk out of the house with mustard on your face. Come here. No, no, no, eew. Reason #2: the dry cleaner in your neighborhood calls me nice lady. He calls me nice lady. You need to build your own nest. Living with me-- - I'd just become a crutch for you. - So be my crutch. You are so Markie Post in every single Lifetime movie. Eew. Grace, this is right. You'll see, it's gonna be great for you. How? I'll be in a crappy apartment somewhere, alone, sitting around reading a human interest story about, I don't know, a kitty, with no hind legs, who pulls herself around on a cart. Then I'll be sad, because I'm alone, and kind of wounded, and I'll identify with the kitty. - I am that kitty. - You are not that kitty! Trust me, you're a big ol' calico. - Really? - Yeah. - Yeah. I can do this. - You can do this. I should do this. This could be the best thing I've ever done for myself. Look at you. Gettin' on, gettin' past. Gettin' a little sick, what's in this thing? Will, I'm scared. Of course, you're scared. You're supposed to be scared. - I'm scared. - You are? Yeah, I just ate a hot dog from a vendor with three teeth. I'm terrified. Will: Sign here. Initial here. Put the pen here. Shake my hand here. As your attorney, it gives me great pleasure to inform you that you are now the largest manufacturer of buffalo feed in the entire Southwest. Say it again! You are now the largest manufacturer of buffalo feed in the entire Southwest. It just sounds sexy, doesn't it? - I'm hot. - Yeah, let's go celebrate. Harlin, can I take a rain check? I am so tired. Figuring out all those billable hours really wiped you out, did it? No, just this guy who's living with me. Look, Will, I know it's none of my business, but when my wife and I are having a problem, I light some candles, get out some nice aromatic oils, then rub it up-- it's just none of my business. No, it's just a friend who's staying with me temporarily. He keeps odd hours. He's got the energy of a ferret. He's messy, and he's got this enormous bird. And by bird you mean-- Bird. Just checking. Woman: Will, it's Grace on line two. - Hey. - I found it, it's great. - Come overnow. - Where is it? It's in Brooklyn Heights. Get off at the Borough Hall stop. - I'll meet you there. - Wait this connection must be bad. I could have sworn I heard you say Brooklyn. What do you think? - I think we're in Brooklyn. - You hate it. No, no I don't. Who knew there were such nice apartments in Brooklyn? I thought the only thing in Brooklyn were the Dodgers, and about 300,000 guys named Guido. Will, the Dodgers left Brooklyn in 1958. Sweetie, you know I don't follow the volleyball. - Look at that tree. - They really do grow in Brooklyn. Grace, you have a new apartment! I know! - We need to do something. - We need to play the game. Yes! What game? The guess-where-all-my- stuff's-gonna-go game. - I just made it up. - Oh, excellent game. - Ready? - Yeah. I'm up against the wall with a southern exposure that gets all the light during the day. What am l? You're the ficus. Yes. Good. Moving on. I'm above the fireplace. What am l? You're the ugly piece of string art you got in Santa Fe. If you're not even going to challenge me, I can leave right now. Okay, okay. Captain's chair. Come on, Grace. Okay, okay. I got one. ( spitting ) What am l? I don't know what that is, but I am really embarrassed for you. - I'm the humidifier. - Oh, yeah. One, yes! Coming back! - The lease? - No, haven't done anything yet. No, it's a two-year lease. - And you've signed it. - Okay. I am old, and I once lived in Aunt Reba's house, and I'm not Uncle Joe. Sweetie, I've gotta go. I left Harlin back at the office, - and I gotta get back. I'm sorry. - Okay. Call me. I will. I'm really happy for you. I'm a coffee table! Announcer: Tonight: comedian Sandra Bernhard; twelve-year-old pig caller Joni Marchinko; and Regis Philbin with Andy Richter and The Max Weinberg Seven. Now, here's your host Conan O'Brien! Jack, I'm sorry, but-- Morning, roomie. Last night you missed it. They had grizzly bear attacks on The Discovery Channel. It was good, but I wanted better. What did you break? Can't a fella just make another fella a little meal? You broke another wineglass, didn't you? Welcome to Cynical lsland, population you. I just think it's a little sad, Will, that you can't accept a simple act of kindness without turning it into something ugly and bitter. Okay, Guapo pooped on one of your suits. There, let the bile flow. Jack, it's all right. Excuse me? It's a suit, I can get it dry cleaned. That's true. Since I'm going, do you need anything cleaned? On me. Where's Guapo? What did you do with him? Pretty bird? Jack, Guapo's fine. What? Can't a fella dry clean another fella's-- I want you out. I'm asking Grace to move in. Oops, I did break another wineglass. Jack, come-- you're leaving in a week anyway. She belongs here. I thought if she had her own place it would be good for her, but it's not good for me. She's too much a part of my everyday life. I can't have her all the way over in Brooklyn. So you think you and Grace moving in together is the best thing - to do for the both of you? - Yeah, I'm sure of it. And I'm out? No, no, that's very interesting. - Now I know how your suit feels. - Oh, Jack. Come on! It's not that big a deal. You can stay at your mother's. What is that? Some type of sick joke? All right, then maybe you can stay-- You know what? I can take care of myself, thank you very much. Don't worry about me. I'm a survivor. - So you'll be at your mother's? - Yup! Jack: Grace, Grace, where are you? You're making a huge mistake. Are you Karen? Yes, honey. Well, Peter, Paul, and Mary, you are fabulous. Well, thank you. - Who are you? - I'm Jack. Jack? Oh, Will's Jack? Well, hello, honey. We've talked on the phone a million times. I can't believe we've never met. Look at you, you little hottie. Stand up. Oh, no, come on. Look at you. You are a rocket ship. Oh, get out of here, you strange person. This is-- what is this? PS, loving the boobs. Perky, with all kinds of attitude. Store bought? Huh-uh. Right on. God, I had no idea you would be so-- kitten-with-a-whip! Come on, let's touch stomachs. Oh, my Lord. You are a complete freak. So, honey, what are you doing here? Why are you here? What's going on? What's happening? What's that? I borrowed this tassel from Grace two months ago, - and I never returned it. - You borrowed one tassel, for what? Let's just say a lamp. Okay, come on, honey. Stick around, talk to me. I have nothing to do today. Grace is taking the day off to move. Not where you think. - Shoes? - Chanel. - Fabulous. - I know. What are you telling me? Will is asking her to move in with him. Honey, no, no, she can't move into his place. That's not acceptable. Tell me about it, you feisty little Shih Tzu. Oh, honey, how is she ever going to get married if she's playing house with a gay guy? No offense. Just guessing. - Hey. - Hi! How did you get up without buzzing? For three bucks you can get into any building on this block. - Actually, this one only cost two. - See? I'm a bargain. So, what do you think? It's great. I met one of your neighbors on the way in. I'm sure he's a lot less threatening with his pants on. Okay, got it, Will. Brooklyn bad; Manhattan good. Look. Is this perfect here or what? It's perfect. It's also mine. Oh my gosh, it is? - It is. - Keep it, you keep it. Really? Thanks. I'm glad you're here. Tell me where this mirror should go. - How about here? - Over. - Over. - Hello? Arms. Further, go on. Eh, eh, eh - Will, I'm going out the door. - Trust me. Take it into the hallway. Now get in the elevator, and go downstairs, and get in the cab that's gonna take you back to my apartment, 'cause I want you to move in with me. Look at you. Look at what you're doing. This is the face of a man who's driving me crazy. Why? I thought you'd be happy. I thought-- I'm talking to my-- Can we put this down, please? We're born roommates. What's the problem? What's the problem? The problem is it's too late. I can't believe this. What happened? What happened to the whole you being a crutch thing? Some people might call it a crutch, but-- what's a crutch? It's support. Support from someone who loves you. Someone who has a terrace, which you don't, out here in Murderville. I can't believe you're doing this. Why are you doing this? - You're too far away. - Listen to me. I packed boxes, I overpaid movers. My mother's been here, and hates it. I'm staying. Grace, you just left the man you were gonna marry. I just got out of a seven-year relationship. Why should we go through that alone? At the end of the day, I'd like to be with my best friend. So would l, but I'm here. I can't talk you out of this? I'm a lawyer. I'm very good at this sort of thing. I know, you talked me into it. I should sue myself. Will, I've got to do this. I have to have done this. Be happy for me. It's good that I have my own place. Even if it is in Brooklyn. Ya know what I'm talkin' about, ya big mook, with your 90-mile-an-hour hair? Okay, I've done this. - Goodnight, Will. - Goodnight, Gracie.   
                




                    			What you find Will! feel, now What you know To be real Will! Will! Oo-ooh Your love's for real now You know that your love is my love I have a problem. Sweetie, I was right in the middle of busting a move. Could you come with me for a second? But l-- Try busting a move in here, sweetie. Come on. Shake it, Puff Daddy - Okay, Grace, take it easy. - I can't handle this anymore. Look at the size of this place. My hair doesn't even fit in here. Open that cabinet. I'd rather go for what's behind the curtain. I'm afraid that's gonna be a zonk. Can't you smile a little bit with a-- Okay, point taken. I promise after work, we'll come up with a good solution. - Okay? - Thank you. What are the double-D batteries for? Oh, it's for my Waterpik. You don't have a Waterpik. Let's just say I do. Jack: No, it's fine. He knows me. I don't need an appointment. He's happy to see me. No, don't buzz him. Thanks, you're my new best friend. Call me every 10 minutes. What a bee-atch! Jack, she's just doing her job. I think that's the first time I've used the words "Jack" and "job" the same sentence without "needs to get a" in-between. Speaking of which, how goes the employment search? Take me to lunch. Have you even decided what it is you want to do? Still not sure, but I do know that on my resumé to be Helvetica. I wonder how "chorus girl" will look in Helvetica. Come back Thursday. We'll do your resumé together. Come on. - Take me to lunch. - I can't. I've gotta finish marking up this contract, and then I want to get Grace some cool shelves, or something for her bathroom. She hates it. Of course, she hates it. It's too small for her. It's too small for Malibu Barbie. Why don't you just share your bathroom? My God, I think that's the first time you've used the words "Will" and "share" in the same sentence without "doesn't know how to" in-between. What are you talking about? You've had one common problem in all your relationships-- you. - I'm good at relationships. - Are ya? Hm-mm. Let's take a look at a little clip from when it was still the Michael and Will Show. Before it was cancelled. "Will, can I change your throw pillows?" "No." "Will, can I put my sweaters on your shelf?. " "No." "Will, can anyone live with a control freak nightmare like you?" I'm gonna say, no. Are you ready for a bag full of happiness? And I am not talking about your stoner days. Okay. I got this stuff at Bed, Bath & Beyond, and the crazy thing is it wasn't in bed or bath, I found it all in beyond. Look, shelves. This is your solution to my space problem? You want to bring the walls in closer? - Okay, bad idea. - Uh-huh. I can return. I can return to the beyond. - You want to hear my idea? - Sure. - It's very exciting. - Tell me. - It's very different. - What is it? - It's very big. - It's very annoying. - All right, sit down. - Miss Grace, you play so rough. I want to knock down the dividing wall between the two bathrooms, and make one, big, beautiful bathroom. Oh? Look at this. This month, East Coast Living, Metropolitan Home, both showing the one big bathroom. It's elegant, it's function with style, it's-- hold on a second, I'm getting overwhelmed by my own good taste. Whoa! Better, decorating rush. What do you think? No. No? No to elegant, no to style, no to me, what? - I'm sorry. I just-- - It's too much for you. I knew it. I wasn't thinking. I was blinded by the faucets. - Grace, l-- - No. No, no, no It wasn't a good idea. I should have known. Michael couldn't even get you to change shampoo. Let's do it. Will, I wasn't saying that to guilt you into something. You're not. Saying no is a knee-jerk reaction, and I have got to stop doing that. - Really? - No. See? I can't help myself. Yes, yes, yes. And besides, it's you, and this is a really cool idea. You don't even know, mister! Silver nickel under counter sinks, handmade faucets, multiple showerheads. There's even room for a chaise lounge. I'm thinking washable suede. Now you see, if you had led with the washable suede, I wouldn't have thought twice. - So I can start? - Do it, baby! - This is very exciting! - Okay, Grace. Slow down now. It's wrong to love a faucet this much. You're right. I don't want to fall too hard. They tend to run a little hot and cold. Go back to the singing. Oh, honey, your skirt's hiking up. - Hey, Kare? - Yeah, honey? Just FYl, the first three letters in assistant spell "ass," so please get off yours. But I was just trying to tell you your control tops were showing. Leave the skirt. - Karen? - Yeah? - Why do you want to work for me? - Honey, because I adore you, and because I always worked before I married money. I joke. Of course, I mean Stan. I joke! Of course, I mean money! Karen, I have a great deal of affection for you, but you need to be a better assistant. Put the catalogue down. You have everything in it. Come with me. I'm gonna show you what I'm working on. Okay? Look at this. This is a rough draft of what I'd like the bathroom to look like. When I'm finished with this drawing, I'm gonna need it copied, and sent to a few people. You mean like - the contractor? - Yes, yes, yes, That is exactly right! Oh my God, I feel like The Miracle Worker. Good, Karen, good! All right, honey. Reel it in. I get it. Talk to me about this little doodle here. This doodle is called a blueprint. Whatever it is, honey, I love it. Who's it for? - Me and Will. - You and W-- Woman, are you insane? You can't share a bathroom with the person you're living with. Honey, do you know where Stan's bathroom is? God, I don't even know where Stan's bathroom is. I'm not worried about it. Our relationship is special. Grace, I may never have had a special relationship with a man, but I have been married twice. And I can tell you, this is a mistake. Will and I want to do this. This is a big step for him. He's really open to it, and I'm proud of him. And I'm proud of you for trying to be interested. Well, thank you. Hey, you know what? Tomorrow, I'm gonna be in before 11 :00. Baby steps. All right, 11 :30. - Hey. - Hi. Do you have floss in your bathroom? I'm out. Sure. Grace, don't be shy. If you need floss-- - Hi, Will. - Hey. Huh? Huh? Uh-huh. Oh my God. Oh. Whole lotta tweezin' goin' on. What, are you clear cutting? Yes, I tweeze. Get used to it. You're gonna see me tweeze my eyebrows and I'm gonna see you tweeze the little hairs on the outside of your ear. I don't have hairs on the outside of my-- ow! What the hell?! I don't even know what to say to that! Hey, hey, hey. - Don't you need the sink? - I can wait. No, don't wait. Let's just do what we normally do. - Deal. - Okay. What you find What you feel, woo What you know To be real - What's the problem? - Problem? We're just like 50 men and a mirrored ball away from being a gay disco. Oh, uh, Grace? Sweetie, what's that? That? It's a hat. I didn't have time to dry my hair. So What are you saying, honey? It's gonna stay on all day? - Uh-huh. - You know what? I say we close. You're obviously in no condition to work. Stop. Karen, how about some coffee? Oh, no. I had some on the way in. Thanks. Oh, you want some? Oh, devil. I need an assistant. All right, where is it? Never mind. Oh my God. I'm The Cat ln The Hat. This bathroom is driving me crazy. No, actually, Will is driving me crazy. The bathroom is fine and I've got a doodle that proves it. No, honey. It's a blueprint. Yeah. You get a gold star. You know what? Will's gonna get through this. I've gotta relax and ride it out. It's like the storm before the calm. You had to know this was gonna happen. Men hate change. Usually, you can't lump Will in with other men. - He's-- - Oh, honey, come on. Gay, straight, bi, Thai, they don't like change. What is that, an Upper East Side haiku? Grace, this is for his own good. You are not a guest in that place, you're a roommate. So start takin' up some room. You hardly put a foot in the door. It's time to take off those pumps, put on those espadrilles you're so fond of-- which, by the way, aren't coming back ever-- kick down that door, and let him get used to the fact that you live there! God, that was exhausting. I am assisting my ass off. - Last job? - Physical therapist. You ran the man-tan booth at Le Spa. It involved a lot of lifting. Did I mention that Grace put all of our cereals into one big container? Women, can't live with 'em. End of sentence. That's just wrong. Right? She should be caned. Back to Jack, right here. I was a Broadway usher for two grueling performances of "Les Mis." What are you saying, it's me? 'Cause I'm-- there should be certain boundaries. At least with breakfast grains. Are we talking about my resumé or your problems? I don't have any problems. Ellen, honey, could you bring in Will's denial file? I think we have a little something to add. I am not in denial. Come on, I don't have all day. I'm meeting Harlin for drinks at my place, and I've got a lot to get done. Next job. Let's see. What have I done? What do I want to do? What is the essence of Jack? How does one put that into words? Cater waiter, cologne spritzer, Gap. Delete, delete, delete. Oh, this is so difficult. Ellen, honey, could you bring in a couple of diet colas and some of those blue pills? Jack, get away from my stuff, and out of my space. You know what? Hold that thought until I get Grace on the phone, because I think you meant to bark that at her. No, Jack, that was meant for you. Grace and I are fine. Yeah. Okay. You and Grace are falling into the same patterns as all your relationships. You're a little time bomb ready to go off. This is not about that! This is about being late to meet Harlin, because you're wasting my time. It is about being galled at your level of presumptuousness, and finally, ladies and ladies of the jury, this is about my total frustration over helping someone get a job whose main requirement is cute guys in the mailroom! And so ends a scene from Mr. Bitch Goes To Washington. - Hi. - Hey. Sweetie, Harlin's gonna be here any minute, so you should probably get dressed. I am dressed. You're gonna wear that? How about, "Grace, you look like crap"? - That's much more concise. - No, you look fine. I just thought you'd want to meet my biggest client in something more than underwear. This is a good dress, Grandpa, but I'll change if it means that much to you. No. I mean, yes. No, I do mean no. Don't change. You look-- you look beautiful. Okay. - What's this? - What's what? Well, I said get cheese. There's no cheese here. You see that stuff right there, that looks, and smells, and tastes like cheese? - That's cheese. - Well, yeah, but you can't just put out a few slices. - You gotta have a whole wedge. - Really, Will? 'Cause I just read "Cheese For Dummies" cover to cover, and they never mentioned the wedge. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm a little anxious about Harlin coming here. - It's-- - Forgiven. Okay. - What's this? - What now? The pillows? I'm not really vibing on the whole Benihana Home Collection thing. - That is gorgeous Chinese silk. - Well, what's over here? We got a new lamp and little baby goat heads. What-- what-- what-- when did you decide to redecorate? Will, I live here. And if you're having a problem with the bathroom, you should just say it now. Let me say this then, from now on, all pillows and food need to be cleared through me! Whoa! Okay, I don't want to do this right now. - No, we're talking about this. - Well, talk to the goat, - because I'm not doing this. - Will! - Don't shut me off. - Click. - Damn it, Will! I'm not Michael. - ( knocking on door ) Evenin'. Harlin, right on time. Come on in. Beautiful place. Oh, you must be Grace. These are for you. That's very sweet, Harlin. Thank you. Please. - Will, where do these go? - Anywhere you want. Yeah, right. Thanks. I gotta tell you, it's awful nice of you folks to ask me up. When I'm up here on business, I'm always in hotels. Yeah, I've stayed at The Hyatt. I've stayed at The Plaza. I used to stay at this place in Midtown till I saw that thing on Dateline. Maria Shriver showed up with one of those blue lights. Iet's just say they were very unsanitary. It was very nice meeting you. Excuse me. Will, are you sure you're gay? 'Cause this felt exactly like a night between me and the missus. - Hi. - Excuse me, I'm in here. - We need to talk. - I'm taking a bath. Fine, then I'll leave. Can I have a towel? No. Gracie, I don't-- I don't know if this gonna work out. Fine. Are you done? I feel bad about this, but I think-- maybe we need to rethink this living situation. - Bailing. - I'm not bailing. I just-- I have some issues I need to work through, and obviously, I need to work through them alone. Bailing faster. Why don't you just jump out of the boat completely? I'm rigid, I'm passive-aggressive, - I'm controlling. - News flash! Will's controlling. Yeah, got that freshman year of college when you told me what electives to take. Funny, 13 years later and I'm still here. So if you think I'm gonna let you bail out now over a bathroom-- It's not the bathroom. It's me. You're my best friend. If I can't make this work with you, then what chance do I have of ever having another-- ever having another relationship? You are putting way too much pressure on this. How did we get from me having a place to plug in my hot rollers to the demise of all your future relationships? When did you become such a drama queen? I had problems with Michael, and clearly, I'm repeating that pattern-- Did you just call me a queen? If the tiara fits. I love you. I hate this bathroom, but I love you. Oh, honey. This whole bathroom thing is so over. - That wall is goin' back up. - Yeah. Loofa. Or-- now, I'm no Grace Adler Designs, but what if we just moved the wall four feet, and then we'd have equal bathroom? Look at you. Mr. Compromising, Mr. Not-So-Controlling. Don't do that! Grace! Oh my God! You're naked!   
                




                    			Grace: Mm-mm! Mm-mm! This is good. - Basil. - Mm-hmm. - Garlic. - Mm-hmm. Ooh. Not liking this. - Coriander. - Scary spice. - Harlin's up again from Texas-- - Mm-hmm. and guess what he did today? Trapped a possum and ate it live? Yes, actually. I'm trying his recipe. He bought an apartment on the Upper East Side, and guess what? He needs a decorator. Oh, and guess what? It's you. Will, no. Huh-uh. Why not? Come on, he needs our help. He's separating from his wife, and I think he's looking for a change. Tell him to wear socks. Beep, beep, beep! Oh look, it's the money truck backing up. Keep going, Grace doesn't want any, thank you. Okay, you know what this would be? Sophomore year in college. You set me up with your TA. And you wanted it to be perfect. You told me what to say, what to order, what base I could go to. - What base did you get to? - Second. Oh, come on, Will, he was a TA. So, T but no A? Hello! Not the point. The point is I know you. You'll butt in. - I won't. - Oh, but sweetie, you will. He's your biggest client. I know you just want everyone to be happy, but you can't help yourself. You've got a problem. What? It's a bad habit. For God's sake, I can control myself. Betty Ford set up a nice little place in the desert based on that very statement. Grace, I won't butt in. Grace, come on, do it. It'll be a piece of cake. - Oh, but-- - Harlin is a man of few words. Here' show it'll go, "Howdy. I love it. Here's your check." Why is this so important to you? I'm a matchmaker. I like to help people. People-- - You already promised him. - Yeah. Oh, Will. Okay, okay, Will, but here are the rules: this is between Harlin and me; you set it up, and you walk away. You're just the pimp. Great. Now I've gotta get a big-ass hat, and shoes with live fish in the heels. ( keys rattling ) Ladies and gentlemen, Jack McFarland! Jack, shut up! Grace is asleep. Well, wake her up! I've got big news! I was walking down the street the other day, and I got to thinking, what is it that I do best? This is not a place for you to respond. And then it came to me, clear as a bell. "Jack, you have a special gift that you're not sharing--" also not a point of entry. Okay, Jack, what is it? What is the special gift? Tell me before the anticipation builds to a terrifying frenzy. You done? Wait, wait, let me rephrase that. Um, you're done. The thing that I do best-- and I'm talking fast so you can't interrupt -- is sing. - Sing? - I have a beautiful singing voice. Yes, you do. Actually, it's beautiful. So I've decided to take my career in a whole new direction. Forward? This guy, let me tell ya-- Thursday night, downtown at The Duplex. Be there, be blown away. What are you talking about? You're not a performer. I am now. Me, a piano, and a spotlight. I'm calling it "Just Jack!" Here's my flyer. Just Jack, one night only, Just Jack. Why one night-- oh, it's open mic night. Bring Grace. Or a date. I'm sorry. "A roller-coaster ride of emotions." Who said that? A critic. Okay, my shrink. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for Just Jack. Touch me in the morning Honey, I'm busy. Touch yourself. Busy? Oh, that's right, because in the office of Karenworld, that's considered filing. Oh, I forgot. You're kind of funny. All right, I'll talk to you. What are you doing? Why are you here? What's that? This is the flyer from my nightclub act. You have to come. Why? Who's gonna be there? Let me remember, who's on the guest list? The king of-- I'm gonna be there! Why? ls that not enough for you? Oh, come on, please come. Please, please, please Be your best friend. Honey, I don't really do that. All right, what time? The magic starts at 10:00. Bring someone. Let me show you my entrance. No, no, no Honey, you don't just saunter out like that. You're not Merv Griffin. Come back tomorrow, and we'll work on it, okay? Karen, you can't just devastate me, and kick me out. You're not my lover. Honey, reel it in. All right, fine. I'm leaving flyers, give them to friends. Yeah, right. "Just Jack"? The magic starts at 10:00. Was that a proposition? No, that was just Jack. I'm Harlin Polk. I'm supposed to meet Grace. I'm Karen Walker. I'm supposed to be Grace's assistant. You don't strike me as the assistant type. Well, honey, behave yourself, and I won't have to strike you at all. Go on, honey, sit down. Grace will be here in a minute. I noticed you have one of those flyers. - You goin'? - Oh, honey, I'm always goin'. Hi. Oh, Harlin. Hi, you're here. Good. Will just showed me your apartment, and I love it. - She loved it! - Yeah. I've got a lot of ideas. We can go color, earthtones, minimal, ethnic, mélange-- Iet me apologize right now for my brazen use of the word mélange. Mélange is a French term that designers use. - It means sort of a whole-- - Will? Don't you have some fish in your shoes to feed? Absolutely. Gotta go, and feed my shoes. That's just a thing Will and l-- you probably didn't get it. Whatever I don't get, I just figure is gay. Okay. Okay. If I were an animal skull, where would I wanna be? - ( knocking on door ) - Hang on, Harlin. - Harlin, hi. - Howdy. - Let's take a look. - Okay. - Will? - Well, hi. Sorry, l-- You know, Grace, at some point that dog needed water. - Will, what are you doing here? - Don't get mad, - he asked me to come. - Fine, but not one word. - Just a pimp. - Okay. Look at this! I've only done the living room, but this should give you an idea of the direction I'm going. It's Texas meets New York. It's Ralph Lauren meets cowboy chic. It's "Dances With Wolves," and deer, and cows, and one very slow armadillo. Whoa! Uh, saddle. You say, "Whoa!" Harlin, take a seat. Feel the leather on this couch. You know, Grace, I love the way you've got the-- turquoise vases over the top of the armoire. - What? - You know, the way they're over the top? Over the top. - Wait, he's-- - And these pillows. Look at these pillows. Don't they just say-- ( purring ) Maybe you don't speak pillow, but trust me, that's what they'd say. I think Grace would agree with me when I say that this is an extreme version of an idea that Grace will now distill into a more refined, elegant essence. No. Actually, I wouldn't agree with that at all. And you can see what I've done over here. - Ow! - What now? Sorry, I was gored by the comfy chair. ( keys rattling ) Hi. What are you doing? Sublimating my rage towards you with cheesecake. You just couldn't help yourself. You did exactly what you said you weren't gonna do. - What was that all about? - What's that apartment all about? Could you have been more insulting? It looked like Gene Autry exploded in there. I didn't design it for you. I did it for a 6'4" man from Texas. If I was doing "young gay lawyer," it'd be deco with "fear-based bitchy" wallpaper. - I know Harlin-- - Yeah! And I know design. If you called me at work and I wasn't there, the answering machine would say "Grace Adler Designs." If you opened my purse, my business cards would say "Grace Adler Designs." Seems like the only person who doesn't know Grace Adler Designs is her best friend! Let me introduce myself! I'm Grace Adler! I design! - Wow, I'm cutting you off. - No, no, no! This is not the cheesecake talking! This is know-how talking, and I know how to design for Harlin. That place is perfect for him. So come on, lawyer, tell me what Harlin said after I left. He said you're fired. He said what? - He said you're fired. - That's it? That's Harlin. He's a man of few words. - Not even a howdy? - No howdy. No, no, no. No, I'm not fired. I'm gonna call him. You're not gonna call him, Grace! You're fired! No, I don't get fired, and I definitely don't get fired by you. - I didn't fire you, he fired you. - I am not fired. - Grace, you are so fired. - Do not say that again. Oh my God, I'm fired. Yeah, you're f-- the F word. You still wanna go and see Jack's show? - You screwed this up for me. - What, do you say it's my fault? Yes! Of course, it's your fault. You sat there and you ridiculed every piece of furniture right in front of him! Because every piece of furniture was a hollowed-out animal. - Harlin said that? - Yea-- no! He didn't verbalize that, but I think the expression on his face said everything. The expression on his face didn't say anything other than "Hey, I'm Harlin's face!" You made it impossible for him to say that he liked it. Grace, don't you think it's possible, maybe, that he didn't like it, because you made some bad choices? No! All right, can we talk about this later? We have to get ready for Jack's show. Wear the blue sweater. We are so taking separate cabs. Jack: I don't know. Do I go with the Peter Allen Copacabana sleeve, or the Julie Newmar basic black? Come on, you're on in two hours. Let's see some show! Okay, I'm starting with this. No, no, honey. No, no, no stop, stop, stop. Eh, coma. I wanna sing a ballad. I cry really good. I can do the single tear. Honey, you're in a gay club with a nice ass. Start shakin' that moneymaker. You're nasty, Miss Jackson. Oh, honey, you have no idea. All right, push that red button. My kid has one of these. - Red is samba. - Karen, don't you-- You just push it, push it, push it. Come on. - Now what? - Now let it in, honey. Come on, come on, honey. Up, up, up Come on, trust me. I'll you a little somethin' here. It's very simple. Keep your eye on the bird. And shoulder, and shoulder. Easy does it. And hips, and hips. Add the hips. Yeah. And swing it, and swing it. Saucy. Around the world, around the world. We like to travel, uh-huh. Feel kinda dirty. In the good way. Yeah, that's taking shape, but-- here, stick with me. There-- there you go. Oh, oh, yeah. There you go. Around the world, around the world. One-way ticket. Paris, Brazil, Bangkok! Uh-huh! - Yeah, you feel the difference? - Yeah. What's going on, honey? What is this? My tummy feels funny. Turn it off, honey. Turn it off, turn it off. You were right, honey. Start with the ballad. - Will? - Harlin, what are you doing here? I was in New York, and out walkin' around. I just thought-- is Karen here? Yeah, she's here, and she's married. Oh! Is she married like I'm married, or is she married-married? I think somewhere in the middle. - Drink? - Scotch. Listen, I wanted to ask you, you didn't fire Grace because I didn't like the way she did the apartment, did you? - Of course not. - I didn't think so, but Grace was-- Jack: Hi. - I'm so glad you got in. - Jack, the place is empty. Don't upset me before a performance! Thank you for the flyer. This is my first time - to come to a cabaret club-- - Yeah, yeah. You know what? I'm thrilled that you're here, but I'm in performance mode, so I can't really invest. I've really gotta go to zero. We'll talk backstage in my dressing room, okay? - You mean the bathroom? - That's funny. And thanks for the flowers and the telegram. - I didn't send flow-- - Yeah, I know. 'Cause you know that Grace, she didn't mean to offend you with the way she decorated the place. Offend me? I thought it was great. I wish she could have finished the job. Then why did you fire her? It wasn't because of the apartment, it was because of the tension between the two of you. I'm in the middle of my marriage breaking up and I didn't want to be responsible for breaking up another-- whatever that is you two got goin'. What are you-- what are you saying? - You fire her because of-- - Because of you, Will. So what if I butt out? What if I go gay? Come on, Will. You are who you are. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to use the backstage. Howdy, partner. Come on. Sit down. The show is starting. Sit, sit, sit. He's a little nervous, he's a little nervous. Oh, hell. I'm a little nervous. Woo! Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jack McFarland, but for tonight, I want you to think of me as Just Jack. Hi, Grace. - Hi. - First of all: I still hate you, - and you will be punished. - Okay, but-- - but about the whole Harlin-- - I was thinking - on my way over here in the cab-- - --but I think you should know-- --okay, maybe you should stop butting in for once, please. Okay. I was thinking that maybe I was a little off the mark in my design concept, and I'm so sorry for getting so angry. - Gracie-- -  Hey, lady You, lady, cursing at your life You're a discontented mother, And a regimented wife Oh. Listen, Harlin is here. Oh my God, oh my God. I don't want to talk to him. - Well-- - What did he say? He liked the apartment. Oh, I've been to Georgia And California, and anywhere I could run Took the hand of a preacher man And we made love in the sun That actually happened to me. Gracie, please, don't give me the squint. I admit that I have a problem. My name is Will T. and I am a butter-inner. I knew it. Look, what can I say? You were right, I was wrong. - You can say that? - I just did. - Maybe again. - You were right. - I think I didn't hear it. - You were right, I was wrong. - Oh, okay. -  Please, lady -  Don't just walk away - You were right, I was wrong, - No, more, more. - You were right, I was wrong. - Come on, come on. -  Why I'm all alone - Loud and proud. - You were right! I was wrong! Hey! It's not the Will and Grace Show! It's called Just Jack! You really think this is necessary? It's the only way we're gonna come to some kind of understanding. Read it back. "I, Will Truman, being the party of the first part, having caused grievous injury to the party of the second--" I could help you put this in actual legal terminology. You just can't help yourself, can you? You're pretending to be a lawyer. - You pretended to be a designer. - Point taken. Keep going, there's more. "The party of the first part shall heretofore never be a bittunski." Referring, of course, to the landmark case of Buttinsky versus the City of Minneola. - Keep writing, Mr. Insky. - Hold on, hold on. I just gotta get another napkin. It's the bartender's phone number. Sign here. Initial here. We're done. You realize this is not legally binding until it's been notarized. Case closed. God, isn't this great? No fans, no record execs. Just Jack. Just get in the cab. - So what'd you think of the show? - Jack, you have a beautiful voice. - How about that dance sequence? - Jack, you have a beautiful voice. Did you get a look at that bartender? - Yeah. - I got his phone number.   
                




                    			- Switch. - Whoa. Hold on a second. What's the problem? My horoscope says I shouldn't rush into any change. Gimme that. Happy Halloween! Listen. Dilemma. Donald and I were going to the parade tonight. We had a whole Biblical thing planned. We were going to go as Adam and Steve. But he crapped out on me. It's going to be hard to top last year. They went as second-hand smoke. Preachy, perhaps, but, uh, we saved some lives. Will, come on. I can only do this with you, you're my best friend. We'll have so much fun together. Well, how am I going to say no to that? No. Grace, I can only do this with you. You're my best friend. We'll have so much fun together. Sorry, Halloween means nothing to me. ( gasps ) God can hear you right through the building and she's not happy. Jack, what's the point of dressing up like a fairy princess, when I'm not going to get 10 feet without seeing 100 drag queens prettier than me? News flash! - This is a holiday for six-year-olds. - Hey! Halloween just happens to be the one day out of the year that makes the other 364 bearable. This and the Tony Awards. But fine, turn your back on the gay high holy day. But it is sacrilege! Will: Have a good time, and remember, wear reflective tape, get lots of candy and don't put anything in your mouth that isn't wrapped. Karen, you have to come with me. I can only do this with you. You're my best friend. We'll have so much fun together. Oh, honey, I'm flattered but No. No. I had the greatest costume. My fig leaf was an actual fig leaf. I had to keep it in the crisper all week. What, the leaf?. And then Donald decided he'd rather spend Halloween with his wife and kids. Huh huh, now there's a costume. Come on, Karen, come downtown with me. Honey, I can't go. I have a home, a husband and three beautiful stepchi-- No, wait two. Two beautiful stepchildren. Sorry. Yeah, Olivia and - Mason? - Honey, I was getting there! You're right, you're right. Spend Halloween with your family. Take your husband's kids by their sticky little paws. Knock on the doors of the neighbors that hate you, block after block after block. - I know, it sounds heinous, but-- - In flat shoes. You know, I've never been downtown on Halloween. Oh my God, a virgin! You have to come. You'll be worshipped! I don't know, honey. I really shouldn't. How? Worshipped how? Well, look at you. You're like an icon to gay men. You've got the sass, the class, the ass. What'll I wear? Oh, I don't know. We'd go as a team, Iike Donnie and Marie or Sonny and Cher. Oh, honey, you'd be cute as Sonny. No, no, I'd be Cher. lf I could turn back time Whoooa. lf I could find a-- Whoooa! Look, I'm not going unless I can be the girl, all right? So you figure something out. I just have one costume criterion. Boobs up and out. I'll show you the prospectus by the end of the day, along with the most recent fiscal projections. Herb, let's shuck right down to the cob. You want to buy this company, I want to sell this company. So, let's try to work this thing out. What do you say? All right. Good, good. Send my love to Barbara. Oh, uh, well, then send my love to Katarina. All right, goodbye. See, uh, I was going to close with "Shuck right down to the cob." You know what the secret to big business is? - Act like you don't need the money. - You don't need the money. Makes it that much easier. Well, I better skedaddle. I gotta pick up my kids. Your kids are in town? Yeah, they're having a tour of the stock exchange. Are you planning on taking them public? I'm planning on selling 'em short. Tonight, I'm gonna show 'em a real New York City Halloween. That ought to scare the bejeezus out of 'em. So, uh, what are you going as? I'm not going. I stopped dressing up when I grew out of my mother's shoes. You know I'm joking, right? Okay. Grace and I don't do Halloween. You know, it's a kids' holiday. Oh, you're missing out. Halloween is the best holiday of the year. You'll see what I'm talking about when you get married and have your own-- children. Or-- or when you have your commitment ceremony and adopt your Himalayan whistle kid. Or whatever it is that's in vogue with you fellas now. Will: Here. Taste this. Is there enough curry? Ho! My God! Hot, hot, hot! Hot! Oh my God, I'm sweating. My teeth are sweating. - So a little bit more? - Just a touch. - ( knocking on door ) - Jack: Open up! It's the cops. Jack. $10, he's in buttless chaps. Oh my God. Guess what we are. Uh, a Catholic girl gone bad and, Karen, what are you supposed to be? Oh! No, no, no. We're Body and Soul. I'm body, obviously! And Jack is Soul. David Soul, as in Starsky and Hutch? Listen, we're kind of in a hurry. Maybe I didn't mention most important day of the year. I want to get there before the parade starts. So, uh, one last chance. You comin'? Okay, okay. We just, one thing we need to do first everything else in our lives. Fine. I don't dig these squares anyway. Come on, foxy. Let's bring down the man. I've got your back. Oh boy. This is going to get real old real quick. Okay. The wine is breathing. Food is under control. Okay, pretending not to see Shirley MacLaine's lnner Workout. I'll respond to that in my next life. Okay, our lngmar Bergman film festival is about to commence. - How excited are we? - I am very excited in a bleak, desolate, existential void-y kind of way. ( knocking on door ) Jack, go away. Grace and I are-- are naked and oiled up and about to engage in some Greco-Roman wrestling. Harlin: How long you think that'll take? I'm double-parked. Harlin, that's j--, that's just something Grace and I say. Don't explain. It's just all part of what makes you special, Will. - Hi, Grace! - Hi. Uh, what are you doing here? Uh, kids? With your kids. Will: Hi. I see the resemblance. Look, Will. The deal with Herb is going hinky. He wants to have a face-to-face. I got to fly to Boston right now. - So you want me to come with you? - Uh, no. - I want you to watch my kids. - Tonight?! He said yes! Go on in. I really feel terrible. I didn't know what else to do. You're the only folks I know in New York. Oh, by the way, say-- say hello to Nixon and Buzzy Wuzzy. - They're in character. - Right. Be good. Daddy loves you a buncha oil wells. - I'll try to get back tonight. - Wait, wait, try?! Will, like I told you, Herb is hinky. I, uh, ummm. Hi. My dad voted for you. What are we going to do? I'm allergic to bees and I'm a democrat. Hi. Just so you know, I'm Grace. And I live here too, with Will. This is not a conventional arrangement, but what is convention, really? Grace, what are you saying? I don't know. I'm feeling very, "Little Tommy Has Two Mommies." Ah, you guys breathe in there? Want to take your masks off?. Would you like some curried lamb? Or some vindaloo? Good, Grace. Singe their mouths. I don't know what to do. I'm trying. I'm trying here. Okay, well how about trying to get them some juice? - Juice? - Juice. Juice. Kids like juice. - I'm all over the juice. - Stop saying juice. Um, hey, we got videos. You guys like watching videos? Good, okay. This one's about a man that plays a game of chess with death. Okay, let's see what the other one is. Uh, three sisters confront the slow, painful death of their fourth sister. You're not going to see that on Nickelodeon. Good job! Okay, I'm back. Here's your juice. Clamato. Clamato juice. Yeah, it's every kid's favorite drink. The fresh taste of tomato with the tang of clam. Oh! No, no, no. No, fuzzy wuzzy buzzy. There's a house rule. No gnawing on the $300 Chinese silk. We gotta have something they can play with. Do we have any toys? I don't know what toys you have in the house but mine are very grown-up. Well, all we have to eat is some fresh melon and fat-free Fig Newtons and the Clamato ain't movin'. Look, let--, Iet's take them out trick or treating in the building-- half an hour, then we can eat. Fine. You two, we're going to go trick or treating. - Wait. - Why, what? I think Mr. President has to go potty. Okay, here's the plan. I promised Victor, Toby, Daniel, Patrick, Little Patrick and Roy that we'd meet for a little quick drink at Boy Bar. Then we're gonna hook up with Sergio, Steve, Anthony and Kent - on St. Marks. - All right, all right, I get it. It's girls' night out. Lord, look at this place. We're three seconds away from being mugged or pierced. Karen, would you stop worrying? Nothing's going to harm you. Not while I'm around. Uh-oh. Nothing's gonna harm you Not while I'm around. Oh good. Now I feel safe. You'll frighten 'em away with an Angela Lansbury ballad. Come on, honey. This place is dangerous. I'm supposed to be uptown looking down on all this. I'm going home. ( man gasps ) Oh, Mr. Sister, you are so fierce. Well, thank you, ladies. Snap snap. - He thinks you're a man. - He thinks I'm a 10! Nixon. Hey, Nixon. Hey! Hey! Nixon! I don't want to have to tell you again. Stop shoving your sister. ( knocking on door ) Can I get some help, please? You guys want to watch four hours of Swedish cinema? Then behave yourselves. Don't run! Not you! Trick or treat. - Hey, 9C! - Jerry. Let's see what we've got for ya. Mmm. Looks like all I got left is half a Zagnut. Hey, hey, hey. We don't throw our pumpkins, Mr. President. I don't care how frustrated you get. - Hello? - Hi, l-- - Hello. - Hi. Um, uh, sorry about that. I haven't seen you around the building. You must've just moved in. No, I'm-- I'm down from New Hampshire. - I'm just visiting my sister. - Really. - I'm Will. - Sam. Nice to meet you. I'm, uh, 9C. Will? Buzzy threw up in her mask. I cleaned her up and she still wants to go outside. I say we just get their candy, get them to bed and try to salvage whatever is left of our evening together, okay? - See ya. - Yeah. Thank you. That was perfect timing. - I don't have to be doing this. - Oh really? I didn't have to spend Labor Day with your aunt Marsha in Boca Raton. But not that I didn't love the Yarn Fair, but I could've done without half the condo complex pointing at me and whispering, "So that's the faigelah." Okay. We're playing that game? Four words, Will. Grandma Truman's bedpan. - Bedpan is one word. - Doesn't erase the memory. - That woman made you a quilt. - No, she sold me a quilt. That was a contribution to the-- Whoops. That was just a little Halloween skit that we do. It's called Scary Grownups. The End. Bow. You know what? I've got an idea. - How about we hit the streets? - Good idea. They always say that strangers have the best candy. Come on. Watch the pumpkin there, Mr. President. Oh, look at me. I'm drinking beer out of a bag. I'm so bad. Karen, come on, let's go. We've already missed the scary gay goblins. Listen to her. Lady Complainer. Oh, that's cute. Is that a drag name? Oh, I want a drag name. Give me a drag name! Okay, sugar, here's how you do it. Take the name of your first pet and the first street you lived on. Shu-shu Fontana. Oh, it's so cute. Honey. H-- honey! Come here. What would your name be? Umm Glen 125th. Well, all right, girls. Gather round. Make-up tip time. Okay. First off, a blanket note about base. Don't forget the neck, because they won't. Those Adam's apples don't just cover themselves, now do they, girls?! Shu-shu rules! Go Shu-shu! - Oh my God. - Hutch! Starsky? ( "The Hallelujah Chorus" plays ) Well, I would have to say, that is quite a haul. Huh? Hey, well, Mr. Nixon, don't think I didn't see you steal that extra Abba Zabba from the doorman at the Dakota. - So much for not being a crook. - Uh-huh. So, uh, you guys want to take your masks off now? No, still not ready. Okay. Okay, time to swap. Let's see what we got. On three. One two three. Ooo-hoo. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Didn't those Pixie Sticks land in my bag? Oh, whoa, whoa, easy there, grabbie. These sticks are for my friend Buzz here, 'cause I got my eye on that jawbreaker of hers. What do you say, Buzz, huh? No, don't do it. I got a nice candy necklace that'll look real nice with your yellow skin. Come on, Buzz. Don't make me pull rank on you. I am after all a giant man. And you are just a wee bee. Now, I want that jawbreaker. Whoa. He pulls out the Silly String. This is between me and your sister, mister. And besides - I think you're bluffing. - I don't know. He bombed Cambodia. I think he'd Silly String you as soon as look at you. You're right, Grace. This leaves me no other choice. What you gonna do, Dick? Huh? You string me and I string her. Ha! This is great. You two'll take each other out and the jawbreaker's mine. After all we've been through? Okay. Okay. Two can play at that game, little sister! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Now, let's not get all strung out. Just everybody back off. Nice and slow. Nobody get string happy. Maybe we could just put the cans down and go our separate ways. Right. Or Ha! Yeah! Oh you got me. I'm going. I'm silly strung. Grace. I'm here, darling. - Grace! - I'm here! I'll miss you! I can't live without you! I can keep the apartment, right? Oh! So, this is how you don't do Halloween. Um, how-- how did Herb respond to the prospectus? You know, he seemed like a viable candidate as long as the-- - the FCC approves the-- - Oh, come on, Will. You got Silly String all in your hair. I closed the deal, we'll talk about it later. How'd it go, kids? Oh my God. They've got faces. I thought for a second that would turn out to be Gerald Ford. I don't know what it is. Just a weird feeling. Okay, kids. Let's go. Come on. Wait, wait, wait. Just one piece. Daddy made $25 million today. Don't want it all to go to a dentist. - See you later, guys. - Bye. Thank you, Will. Thank you, Grace. Just a kid's holiday, huh? Okay, back to our night. The food is reheating, the wine, still breathing. - Movie all ready to go. - Whoo-hoo. - Jawbreaker's mine. - No, no, no, no, no! Yes! Yes!   
                




                    			- Hi. - Hey. Oh, yum. - Give me some. - No, Grace, don't. Oh God. That's disgusting. - What is that? - Fruit shake. What fruit is gray? Pears. What? - Oh. - Oh, for-- Oh, Mondo Fuel? You're trying to bulk up. No, it's a dietary supplement. No, it's not. You want za big arms. So you can get za big men, and lure them into your den of zoom-zoom. Okay, thank you very much. That'll be enough, Grace. - Oh my God, what's happening? - What? Your buttons are popping. Your shirt is ripping. You're hulking up! You're turning green! Thank you. Excuse me, this happens to be good for you. Oh my God. It says it also grows breast tissue. You want to give it a try? I thought I knew everything about you, but you're a mystery, wrapped in a riddle, surrounded by enigma, growing boobies. Anyway, how are you? I'm okay. Karen's going on vacation, so I need to find an assistant for the week. Karen files her nails, and thumbs through catalogues all day. What's she gonna do on a vacation? I guess office work. Oh my God. Look, don't. It's too easy. Just give me something' to wear, 'cause I can't walk another block in this Klingon suit. You want us to not make fun of you looking like that. That would be illogical. Sit, alien cater-waiter. Tell us of your pain. Brandon Schwartz's Star Fleet Bar Mitzvah. The decor, USS Enterprise. The menu, intergalactic kosher. Not to mention, one of the little Borgs barfed all over my clothes. Captain, after closer examination, I believe I have identified the life form as "gaylien." We come in peace. Please do not rearrange our furniture. You know what? Goodbye. Okay, okay. We'll stop. No, you won't, because you can't help yourself. You were born bitter, nasty, mean- spirited and, of course, chunky. And, Grace, you're not much better. You are a follower without an ounce of decency. Jack, do you want to work in my office for a week? Although you have the ability to change, and that's what I've always liked about you. Karen's going on vacation. I need someone to help with the phones. - Hours? - Minimal. - Dental? - Lunch. - We can work something out. - Great. Oh, you girls are gonna have a ball, braidin' each other's hair, and talkin' about boys, and doin' the Cosmo quiz. You mean like, How To Tell lfYour Best Friend's A Bitch? Yeah, already took it. You are. Ellen: Karen Walker's here to see you. You're kidding. Send her in. Of course he is. As a $3 bill, honey. Did she just fall off the boat or what? What are you doing here besides outing me to the front office? Well, first of-- oh, Will. The green, no. The lawbooks are kind of cute, though. And you work in a basement? Honey, you've gotta move up from the street. Otherwise, you're sittin' around all day watchin' bad shoes go by. See, Nine West. I love this office. Look at these moldings. This place has historical significance. They filmed "Serpico" just a-- why am I defending my building? Karen, what do you want? Well, what I want-- is for you to get a new rug. Oh, honey. It's too busy, it's shoddy, I'm thinking of leaving my husband, - and those window treatments! - What? What? Bamboo? This is a law firm, not The Tiki-Tiki Room. - Karen! - How can you-- Forget the blinds. Your husband? What's happening with you and Stan? We were about to get on our plane to go black pearl shopping in Bora Bora, when all of a sudden, I looked at Stan, and it dawned on me, marriage shouldn't be this much work. Karen, I'm a corporate attorney. What you need is a good divorce lawyer or perhaps just a good pharmacist. The nastiness comes so easily to your people. Come on, Will. Don't patronize me. I know exactly what kind of lawyer you are, an obscure one. And that's why I need you. I have to find out about Stan's corporate holdings - without him knowing. - Really? This is so Alexis Carrington. Come on. Look, I'm serious. I'm starting to feel as if I don't own my own husband anymore. You mean you don't know your own husband anymore. - That's what I just said, honey. - No, you-- you said "own." No, I said I feel like I don't own my own-- Iike I don't-- Iike l-- oh, all right! Ding! Ding! Ding! You'd win on Jeopardy, smart guy! When does the attorneylclient privilege kick in? As soon as the client gives the attorney a check, but-- no, Karen. Me as your lawyer-- me as your lawyer, consider it done. Jack: Here's something you probably don't know about Will. In elementary school, Will secretly loved the book-- "Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret". We bonded over it in college. - Okay, did you know that Will-- - Oh, please. The day you know more about Will than I do, is the day I gladly kiss your butt. Do me a favor. Sort these tassels. You want me to sort them by color or by size? By 5:00. You want to be useful? Help the man standing behind you with the big package. Grace, don't tease me. - Hello. - Grace Adler Design? I'll sign for it. Just your name, sir. I don't need your phone number. Don't be so sure sir. Jack? Jack? Jack! Hi. Can you put that in the back, please? Thank you. Wow, tell me that guy did not look exactly like Steven. - Who's Steven? - Will's Steven. - Will doesn't have a Steven. - Well, not anymore, but you know-- Oh. You don't know who Steven is. Oops, butterfingers. I guess one shouldn't make any promises they can't keep. With love in your heart, and a smile on your face. - Just tell me who Steven is. - I'm waiting. - Two bucks more an hour. - I'm talking. Steven was a guy at his old law firm. They had a little fling last summer while he was still seeing Michael. And let me just say, Hotty McHot. Ss-sss. - Last summer? - Yeah. He used to call him a client. That was his code word. "I'm having dinner with a client. I'm drawing up some briefs for a client." There were some briefs involved, but he wasn't drawin' them up. - Hey. - Hi. Ready to hear what I have planned for us tonight? First of all, I'm putting aside all of my food issues. So get ready, tonight, we eat wheat. Workin' with Jack. How long did it take before he took one of your silk drapery panels, and wore it like a sarong? Why are you looking at me like that? "I Know What You Did Last Summer." Pardon? The movie. I rented it. - "I Know What You Did Last Summer." - "Last Summer," oh, I see. And "An Affair To Remember." With "The Client." - What do you think? - All the good movies were taken. I think you're also gonna have to watch them alone. - Why, where you going? - I gotta meet with a client. A what? A client. - At 9:00 at night? - Yeah. It's the only time we could both do it. - Who is it? - It's just a client. It's a new client. I'll see you in the morning. Oh, and go easy on the wheat, huh? I don't want to come home, and find you lying on the floor clutching the phone with your finger on the nine. Jack, good, you're still there. Jack: Yeah. I'm still waiting for that package. Grace, where did you get these drapery panels? - Emerald Fabric, why? - No reason. What did Will say when you asked him about Steven? I never got to ask him about that client. Why? - Because he has a new client. - What are you talking about? Oh, like you don't know. He's seeing someone, Jack. I can't believe you kept this from me. I didn't know anything about it. No, it's gotta be something else. Besides, the odds are against him. He's only been with five people in the last eight years. He's like a humpback whale. Without the hump. Oh my God. So what could it be? What could it be that he didn't tell you, and he didn't tell me? It must be something he didn't want us to know. Good work, Nancy Drew. Let's meet up at Old Mystery Creek. Jack, just get over here now. And lose the drapes. I can hear the fabrics rustling through the phone. Can l-- Can I talk to you for a minute as if we were friends? Oh, honey. I know, I know, I give you a hard time, and I make jokes about how you never do any work. But it's funny because it's true. I know. If you're set on divorce, I can help you with that, but it's gonna take an emotional toll. Oh, I don't know, Will. In a lot of ways, I have a very good life. A home in the city, a home in the country, a boat, jewelry, art, cars, a chef, a trainer, - an ass-kicking wardrobe-- - Yeah, I get it. How is the woman inside the ass-kicking wardrobe? and a little bit lost. Will, I don't know what it takes to make a good relationship. I'm no expert, but the key relationships in my life are based on communication and trust. What is he hiding? What could be so bad? Why doesn't he trust me? I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause you're rifling through his stuff. Don't get me wrong, I do this all the time. You're just never here when it happens. Oh, don't worry. Your room, boring. So, tell me again what we're looking for. - Something that spells doom. - ( gasps ) What? He ate all the Mallomars. Oh my God. He's stress eating. He's eating because-- his business is folding. - You think it is? - It all makes sense. He actually asked me when I would pay back the 25,000. No That, he would tell me. It has to be something worse. God, what is he keeping from me? Oh my God. It's drugs. It's drugs. He's doing drugs. Without me. Not that I do drugs, but I'd like to be asked. You know what else he wouldn't tell either of us? lf he's sick. He needs a kidney. Oh my God, he needs a kidney. Not that I would give him a kidney, but I'd like to be asked. - Go check his bedroom. - What am I looking for? Doom. I'll start with his bed. A-ha! I found something! - What?! - Will's new jacket. I'm swimming in it, but loving the fabric. I don't think there's anything here. Oh, no wonder it's so bulky. His day planner's in here. - This is wrong. - You think we should put it away? No, it's the wrong month. Okay, here it is. He's having dinner at the Astor Cafe - with K. - K? Kidney! But he wouldn't be having dinner with one. The Astor Cafe. - No, I can't. - You could. - I won't. - You will. - You're right. - Yes. It seems like despite everything, you're still in love with your husband. I guess in a lot of ways I'm kind of like a younger, much more beautiful version of Leona Helmsley. First, you marry for money, and then you find yourself lovin' the old coot. Then he drops dead, and you get the money anyway. - It's a win-win. - My heart is full. Give me your phone. I wanna call Stan right this minute. - Head, head, head. - Can I help you? - No, I'm just here to see someone. - You need a reservation. To see someone? - We like to protect our patrons. - What do you think I'm gonna do? Run around the dining room, and oversalt their food? Who's my puppy, huh? Who's my naughty, naughty little puppy? Wag that tail. That's right, wag it. Uh-oh. Oh, I know a very, very bad, naughty puppy who's gonna have to go back on his leash. Excuse me, could I get the check? And an airlift out of here? Oh, Stan? I'm gonna have to call you back. I'm gettin' another call, but I'll see you later. Mm-hmm. Start doing your sit-ups. Here, honey, you got a call. And I have to go re-apply. Hello. Hi, it's me. I just wanted to know if there was, you know, anything that you wanted to tell me. - What are you talking about? - You're hiding something from me. - What is it? - How much wheat did you have? Why didn't you tell me about Steven? - Steven? - Yes! I had to find out from-- oh! Damn it! That's the last time I buy a phone to get a free pair of pantyhose. Hello? Keeping secrets is not in our rule book. I know all about K. Well, actually, I don't know all about K. Actually, I don't know anything about K. Who's K? Hold on. Hello? What? No, I don't-- wait a minute. We're all booked up, but it looks like we have an opening at 10:00. Bochner for two. Window seat? Don't push it. - Will-- - I am in the middle of dinner. No, you're not. You're already on coffee. Okay, so I'm on cof-- where are you? It's a secret. Now, tell me. How does that make you feel? Like a sorority girl in a bad slasher movie. Where are you?! Let's just put it this way, the call is coming from inside the house. Grace, you cannot be here right now. - Go home. - No. - Go home! - No. - Go! - No. Excuse me. Would you mind having that crazed redhead removed? Listen to me, I'm Ricky Ricardo. - I'll take care of it, Mr. Ricardo. - No. Excuse me. Look, this is insane. Let her in, please. Okay, what is it? Do you need a lung? I have two. Pick one. Just no more secrets. - Grace, I tell you everything. - Who is K? I can't tell you. Grace, what are you doing here? Honey, what happened to you? You look like an unmade bed. Karen, you're supposed to be on vacation. Grace, I'd like you to meet my client, K. - Hey. - Hi. Let me fill you in on the rest of my evening, so you don't think I'm keeping anything from you. Will? On the way home, I bought a pretzel from a vendor. I think his name was Luba. And I scraped off half the salt. - Come on. - Then I was in the bookstore and I was absentmindedly thumbing through "Marilu Henner's Guide To Life." It was in the bargain bin. She has been able to do the split since she was five? - And bunions are her personal hell. - I get the point. Then, when I was almost home, I thought I recognized someone on the street, so I sort of half-waved, but then it wasn't who I thought it was, so I pretended to scratch my ear-- just so you know. - Enough, already! - What's the deal, Grace? So I don't tell you about Steven. It was a stupid affair. I wasn't particularly proud of it, and I knew if I told you, I'd have to really examine it, when I really wanted it to go away. But, Will, if I think you're hiding something, I'm always gonna think that you're hiding something that's much bigger than it really is. Why would you think that? Because I don't want you to tell me that you're gay again. What? When we were in college, and at Christmas break you told me you were gay, everything changed. Of course it changed. My whole life changed. So did mine. Everything worked out, but I guess I'm just still waiting for you to-- change my world with your next big secret. You almost said "rock my world," didn't you? Maybe. Gracie coming out of the closet is something you only do once in life. You know, it's like being born or watching Magic Johnson's talk show. I promise, no more big surprises. Good. There is one more I should tell you about. I'm pregnant.   
                




                    			Good morning. Hi. You're making wok food? It's 8:00 a.m. What are we having, Hunan Cream of Wheat? What was that? It was a laugh. Pajama pants and an Armani jacket. Kind of going for a Frances Farmer thing? Oh, yeah. I must have forgotten to put my skirt on. You want some bok choy? - You're depressed. - No, I'm not. Then I must be really happy. What's going on with you? Yesterday, I saw the most perfect man. Banana Republic face, lots of corduroy, walking a springer spaniel, and guess what? The dog got a case of naughty snout? Eew. No. Will, I felt nothing. I have no romantic drive. I can't even imagine feeling the urge. Fantasies, gone. - Not even the Baldwin brothers? - No. - Not Alec? - No. - Not Billy? Not Stephen? - No. - Danny? - No-no-no! What about all four together? - We're talking about me. - Oh, yeah. I hope you got some breakfast bars 'cause I'm in a rush. Let me guess. You've got a whole day of nothing ahead of you. You know, anger doesn't really go with what you're wearing. But then again, not much does. I'm on the way to the gym, and I'm feeling a little peckish. - Bok choy. - Oh, bok choy. What's with the get-up? You look like an insane housewife from one of the square states. I haven't really been feeling very-- Uh-huh. Will, can you do something about this? A letter from the IRS? A red letter from the IRS? - How many of these have you got? - Who knows? It's like every week with those guys. Haven't they gotten it by now that I don't pay my taxes? What are they, rejection junkies? Isn't there a number on there you can call to get me off the list? Jack, this isn't an offer for Levolor blinds. - This is the government. - Don't stress me out, Will. I got 30 minutes of squats ahead of me, and that's where my concentration has to go. Listen to me, come to my office at lunch. Bring your receipts, pay stubs, 1099s, W-2-- Ow. Pay stubs, receipts? It's too much. 10 what? I can't possibly remember all of that. Bo Derek, Barbara Feldon. See? Why can't the government do that? I hate Uncle Sam. I'm so over older men. Oh, honey, I think I found something to make you feel better. Oh, Karen, you didn't have to buy me clothes. Oh, I didn't, honey. These are to cheer me up. Yeah, you've been bringing me down, lady. No, honey, these are for you. Clang, clang, clang, went the trolley - Karen? -  Ding, ding, went the bell -  Zing, zing, zing, went-- - Karen! I don't take pills. Grace, these are vitamins. They're good for you. What vitamins are in Percodan? All right, so take them with a banana. Come on, Grace, you gotta do something. You're getting on my nerves. I just think it's easier to embrace it, surrender to the gloom. Listen to me. I'm a bi-level haircut away from Lilith Fair. I am not gonna listen to this. All right, we are gonna get you on the phone with some of those dorks that used to follow you around before you met Danny, and get you out on a date. Karen, that is my whole problem. I'm not interested in going out on a date. Grace, desperate times call for desperate measures. It's time to get your head out of the dumps and your legs in the air. Okay, why not? Zander Freeman. Oh, gosh, he was so sweet. Well, there you go. Call him. I think I will. He was so nice. He liked my perfume. And my shampoo. He was a sniffer. Is that weird? I'm just gonna call him. Will you call him for me? Or maybe I'll seem stupid. No, make me seem official. Or maybe I'll seen snobby. No, it'll be cool. No, it'll be stupid. Give me the card, Hamletta! Honey, we talked about this blouse. Oh, hello. Zander Freeman, please. Yes, hello, Zander. I have Grace Adler calling. Oh, oh, yes. She's just as beautiful as ever. Oh! Oh, that's very sweet. Goodbye! He's gotten fat. What?! What?! What did you just do?! Honey, he had the ho, ho, ho, chortle, which basically says, "I'm a fatty now." But come on, honey. Don't give up the ghost. We'll get there. Come on, spin again. Now, if I'm gonna do this, I wanna earmark where my tax dollars are being spent. AIDS research, and better uniforms for the Army, I dunno, something with shorts. Do you have any idea how the government works? No, but I do know I get a little funny in the tummy around the Washington Monument. Come on. Will, lots of people don't pay their taxes. Yeah, they're called criminals. Can we talk about something else? You haven't paid your taxes for ever. Let me paint a picture of how it's gonna go Nadia. First of all, they'll give you a payment plan, which you won't follow. Then they'll garnish your wages, which you don't have. Then they'll take away everything you own, which would be your gym membership. Then, finally, they will put you in jail. No, no, no. They can't put me in jail. 'Cause since I never started paying my taxes, I can continue not paying them. I saw that on television. On what? The Delusional Channel? Jack, AI Capone murdered half of Chicago. Do you know what they put him away for? One single count of tax evasion. Do you understand what I'm saying? What time is it? There's a cardio- funk class I want to take. - Magnus is teaching. - Jack, I called the IRS. - They're sending an agent Friday. - A person? Like in person? Isn't there any other alternative? There's Canada, but you could only wear short shorts two months of the year. Yeah, I know, Mom. I'm watching it right now. No, trust me, it is not a good way to meet men. Because gay men don't ballroom dance. Oh, yeah, I see him. Well, not the men I want. I gotta go now. The mambo competition is starting. Yeah, I love you, too. - Hi. - Hey. - What are you watching? - National Ballroom Competition. They're so tacky, but in that magnificent way. I don't know where to put my emotions. - How was your date? - It sucked. Gonna need a little more. It was fine. It was nothing. It was beige. He was beige, I was beige, the food was beige. It was beige. Did you give him a little sugar? No. - Did you give him a little nectar? - No. - A little fructose? - No! Nothing happened. After dinner, he walked me to the subway. He was talking, I was tuning in and out, and I started doing that thing where I close one eye, and he was standing in front of the bench. Then I closed the other eye, and he was standing next to the bench. In front of the bench, next to the bench, in front of the bench, next to the bench. He probably thought I was flirting with him. He probably thought you had a neurological disorder. I don't know. I must have a bug in my romance software. Oo-ooh, cha-cha time. Shall we? I'm a freak. You're not a freak. Cha-cha-cha. - What am I gonna do? Huh? - Dip and pivot. I just don't get it. Before Danny, I used to date all the time. I was a little dating machine. I loved men. What's so different in my life now that I don't like men? It doesn't make any sense at all. What, do you want to lead? No, it's you. This is too much fun. I'm having too much fun. What? It's-- it's you. You're the reason it isn't working. You're the reason I'm not interested in men. - ( knocking on door ) - Grace: Will? Will, open up. I have to talk to you. - Will? - Grace? What are you doing? What time is it? I figured out what needs to be done. You and I have to start seeing less of each other. Okay. Let's start now. No! No, Will! Open up! Come on, I'm not done! Okay, come on. Let's go down to the sofa. Please don't tell me you're still blaming me for your crappy love life. Can't you just blame your parents like everybody else? I am putting a moratorium on us, because if I'm having fun with you there is no room in my life to be having fun with someone else. Who? Who is this person you want to have fun with? The other person I could be having fun with - if I weren't having fun with you. - I'm not having fun. - Are you having fun? - No. Then I guess we've achieved our goal. Will, we have to think of ourselves more as just roommates. We can't do everything together. Oh my God, look at me. I'm following you into the kitchen. This is what I'm talking about. We can't do everything together. Like food, like meals. We do too much food together. What if we're home, and we're both hungry? See? Why are we always hungry at the same time? We're too close. We wash our delicates together. That is just weird. No, Grace. No, what's weird is that I have delicates. - You want some coffee? - Yes. No! No coffee! Oo-ooh, you're dangerous. Let me get this straight. If you eat breakfast alone, you'll get the urge to date? Yes. I have to make room in my life for romance. So let's just do this, at least for a couple of weeks. - I think you're wrong. - I think I'm right. I'd just like to go on record as saying I think this is ridiculous! - Note taken. - Any more rules? - One. Starts immediately. - Fine. Feeling horny yet? Tax man: I'm not convinced. I don't consider that a reasonable deduction. - Jack, everything okay over there? - I'm fine. How do you substantiate the $2,100 for magazine subscriptions? That's research for when he was employed as a fact-finder. "Guy World"? Oh, Peter, Paul, and Mary, I'm going down! Will you excuse us just for a minute? Please make it quick. - Pull yourself together. - I can't handle this. I'm freaking out. This is worse than when I was caught shoplifting at Lane Bryant. You have to calm down. We need to act professional. I can't go to jail, Will. I'll never pull off the jumpsuit. I have no waist. - If you don't just-- - No, don't let them take me, Will! I still have a novella to write, and I've never met Barbara Eden! My life is just beginning! I'm sorry for that "Knots Landing" moment. But believe me, it was necessary. You're allotted one of those in your lifetime. You just cashed in. All right, bring that son of a bitch back in here, and let's wrap this thing up! We're ready. I gave you a couple of the other deductions. I think we're done. Here's the figure you owe. Okay, uh, I'd be more comfortable with this. Jack! We're not buying a car. This is fine, thank you. I left you some forms about possible payment plans. - Good day. - Thanks. What am I gonna do? I can't come with $2,000. Jack, relax. There are three things in this world you can count on: death, taxes, and me. Thanks, Will. - Just so we're clear-- - I'm paying it! Okay. I went to culinary school for three years. I don't know, I just always loved to cook-- five sisters. And it turned out great, because while I was making Sunday dinner, they were out mowing the lawn. Grace's voice: ln front of the bar, next to the bar. In front of the bar-- All right, boys. My deal. The name of the game is seven-card stud. Deuces and one-eyed jacks wild, Iow spade in the hole splits the pot, and don't forget to tip your dealer. Here's a tip: cards are dealt down. No, not in this game. No, it's seven-card stud. The first two cards are dealt down. Not in my version, boss man. It's stud poke-- You called low spade in the hole, and if all the cards are up, where's the hole? I'm looking at him. Oh, all right! Blah, blah, blah! - You deal. - All right. Okay, new deck. The game is Follow The Queen. I don't know where to turn. Okay, Follow The Queen? How do you know which cards are wild again? They follow the queen. Wow, it's like playing cards with Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Diva. My, my, somebody's boxer briefs are in a twist. Oh my God, Karen. You have no idea how hard it is for Will. Poof, Grace changes the rules, and they're not stuck at the hip anymore. It's so hard. - You want to go to jail? - No, sorry. Love you, kisses. Okay, Karen, it's to you. Mm-mm, I'll check. - Jack? - Okay, ladies. Papa needs a new pair of flip-flops. Could you move over? You're a little close. News flash, you can't catch it. Hey, everybody. A little pokey going on? Karen, what are you doing here? Jack invited me, but more importantly, what are you doing here? You were on a date, honey. You should have a tongue in your ear right now. He was a great guy. But guess what, Will? I felt nothing. Isn't that great? It wasn't you. You had nothing to do with it. It's me. I'm dead on the inside! That's terrific. Karen, it's up to you. Oh, honey. You sound just like Stan in bed. - So can I get in? - Oh no, I don't think so, 'cause that would fall under the fun category, and aren't we still in the midst of a fun embargo? Oh no, honey. Didn't you hear what I said? Embargo lifted. I'd love to let you play, roomie, but this is for your own good. Will? Grace, no. This week, Joey teaches Blossom a valuable lesson about tough love. I'm waving the white delicate. Can we be friends again? I dunno, I made a lot of money tonight. I was gonna buy myself a new one. - Ask me about my date. - How was your date? Don't ask. He was handsome, sensual, talented, and not even a flutter. It's just weird. Grace, you're being way too hard on yourself. So you're in a low sex drive phase right now. Everybody gets there once in a while, except Jack, and he should be studied. It doesn't feel like a phase. It feels like you're trying to force something, Grace, and you can't. It'll happen when it happens. That's the way I'm dealing with it. - Are we back in fun mode? - Yeah. Good. Agent Grace, here is your assignment: go out and rent the video "Point Break." We'll do a Keanu Reeves, high-fat ice cream combo pack. Keanu in rubber, and chocolate-chocolate chip. Now, that's a lot of sugar. Yes! Oh, and, Gracie, the next time you're gonna offer me a truce, wave your own white delicates. Yours are prettier. - Hey. - Hi. You ever notice the four never lights up? - Hm-mm? - The four never lights up. Really? Oh, yeah. Look at that. You're right. Of course, now we're gonna stop at four. Oops. Sorry. Look at the bright side. We get to spend another Oops.   
                




                    			Will: Rethink it, Barry. Or these conversations are gonna start getting ugly. Hey, sweetie. Good! You brought lunch! Love the outfit. Very Audrey Hepburn. Great. So what you're saying is that I have the neck of a swan, and the chest of a 12-year-old boy. Hey, way to snatch an insult out of the jaws of a compliment. - It's a gift. - What's for lunch? Let's see. Tuna with a side of coleslaw for you. And turkey on wheat for me, with a side of-- what's this? Oh my God. A fabulous investment opportunity? - That's some deli. - Wait a minute. What is it? The owner of my building is selling off space. I have the chance to buy my studio. By the end of the year, I'd be paying less on the mortgage than I'm paying in rent now. Sweetie, that's great. Grace Adler, property owner. I know! And I don't even have to be thimble or the top hat or that weird shoe. When do we get to the part where you start begging for free legal services? After I remind you that I have a photo of you in dolphin shorts and slouch socks. Okay, who's begging? God, buying this place could be so exciting. Just think, these could be my cracked walls, my creaky floors, my cramped bathroom with the non-specific rodent excrement in my soap dish! Oh, honey. Feces, no, no. Hello, love. You didn't tell me the owner of this building was English. I shall find it impossible to conduct this transaction without impersonating Rex Harrison. You naughty, naughty. Okay, what did he say? - He said, "Bangers and mash!" - Will, come-- Muttonchops! Snozberries! Piccadilly! If you don't stop, I'm gonna flip my eyelids up. Okay. Seems like a decent deal. I think the price is still a little inflated, but I think we can get him to his floor. - His what? - His floor, his lowest possible price. Sweetie, stop worrying. - This is gonna happen. - Yes! Let's celebrate at Pablo's Cantina. Oh, no. No, Mexican. Fajita hair. It frizzes when the steaming chicken hits the table. Honey, does it ever unfrizz? Yeah. When you do work. Oh, honey. Oh! Oh! I got it! Let's try that new German place on 3rd, The Hofbrau. Oh, no, no German. I can't handle the schnitzel mit my poopik in da kichel-- Okay, enough with the accents! You know I hate the accents. ( with French accent) But of course. Okay, okay, okay, let's go. Big news! Hit it! B-l-G-N-E-W-S! Big news! I guess we know it's not you coming out of the closet. Correct. I finally found my life's calling, and it involves these two hands. Ah, so you're going to be self-employed. Insert laugh here. I'm going to be a massage therapist. It was an obvious choice, being that I'm a people person. I love people, as long as they're not hairy. Or smelly, or have the dreaded "backne." Okay, I need some guinea pigs. Who's interested? - Smelly. - Hairy. Thank you, friends. Backne. Who am I kidding? It's alabaster from my neck to my ass. I just don't want to do it. You are so beautiful To me Jack, I don't need a masseur. Come on, Karen. I need 100 hours to get certified. Besides, I'm very attuned to the contours of the female form. Just because you had a Growing Up Skipper doll doesn't mean you're ready for the real thing. Right? You are zo beautiful To me I'm not even that crazy about massages in the first place, honey. Can't you see-ee-ee-ee-ee All right, all right. Come over to my place. We'll do it on the lunch hour. any time between 12:00 and 4:00 is fine. So I'm pruning my CD collection and something has to go. What's it gonna be? Bananarama or the soundtrack to "Footloose"? When was the last time you listened to them? - 30 minutes after I got them. - Toss them both. Are you ready to be in the presence of greatness? Tell me. I just got my landlord to the floor. You slut. After you left, Mr. Hutt came up to tell me that there was another buyer ready to put an offer on my studio. My studio. But did I sweat? No, I leapt into action. Wait a minute. You didn't sign anything? Damn right, I did. After I gave him a bid and he bit. I got him to knock off 5%. Sucka! Grace! 5% is not the floor. That's like a tchotchke on the coffee table on the throw rug on the floor. Why didn't you call me? He said he tried to call you, but that you didn't return his calls, - so l-- - Grace, he never called me. I was in my office all day. He lied to me? But that's so dishonest. I know. To think in New York City that someone could actually try to shaft you in business, it's shocking. People can-- can be such meanies. Oh my God. I hate myself. Wait a minute. Why go there? It's negative. I hate him. I hate the British. With those bony hands, and that Princess Anne with her horse teeth. Lose the Boy George CDs! Hey, hey. Do not take this out on the Boy. He gave us a month and a half of some very good music. I think I can fix this thing with your landlord, but, might get a little ugly. Play hardball, baby. Throw him low and inside. He's crowding the plate, - and we gotta go for-- - Grace? Sports, you're losing me. Okay. This is just gonna take me a minute. In the meantime, why don't you take some deep cleansing breaths, and try to relax, okay? Damn it! Piece of crap! I'm sending you love and light. Yeah, love and light. Got it. Hey, you know, I have told her about this. Rosario, por favor, honey. Easy on the fabric softener, okay? No, no, honey. Enougho with the April Fresho. Right now she's calling me a bitcho. All right, I guess we're ready. "Hello, welcome. My name is Jack McFarland, and I will be your massage therapist." Now, I want you to take off your robe, and I don't want you to feel uncomfortable. - The sheet will drape you, so-- - Yeah, I've done this before. Skin to the wind! Wow, Karen! You could bounce a quarter off that thing. Okay. "Are there any specific areas that are troubling you?" Yeah, my marriage. I mean your body, Karen. Well, I dunno, I guess my lower back is a little tight. Ah, yes. "Lower back pain. That means you're holding onto something." Yeah, my patience. Can we just start it so we can end it?! And, hey, be sure to keep your hands off of my-- - How are we gonna deal with this? - Just gonna do a little business. Let me do the talking. You're just the strong silent type with an angry look. Angry, not constipated. Just be the strong silent type. Mr. Truman. Mr. Hutt, appreciate you're coming. You know Grace? - I do indeed know Miss Adler. - How well? She's been my tenant for about-- I don't think you know Grace at all. - Pardon me? - You don't know her, pal. 'Cause if you did, you'd know this woman knows absolutely nothing about business. Mr. Truman, your client is a perfectly competent-- Competent? Did you say competent? Look at her! Does she look particularly business-minded to you? Does this hair say,"I went to the Harvard Business School"? - Will-- - She's a designer. A designer! You know what's up here? Pretty pillows, floor lamps, maybe a couple of chenille throws, and the-- the-- that's all folks! Not a whole lotta room left for numbers! Which is why she caved in at 5%, and you took advantage of that. - I thought the price was fair. - Fair? Fair? Did you hear that, Grace? Apparently, the British have a different definition for the word "fair," you know, the way "Iift" means elevator, or "fag" means cigarette? - Mr. Truman-- - No, no, no, I wanna know more about what you think is fair. First of all, there was no other buyer, was there? And you and I both know you never tried to get me on the phone. Unless you want me to place a little call to the head of the real estate board, otherwise known as my friend Beth, and let her know the way you did business with this naive, vulnerable, clueless artiste, then I'm gonna need a little bit more compensation. - Do I make myself clear? - Perfectly. Perhaps this price would be a bit more agreeable to you? Now, that is a floor. I'll have my office draw up the new papers, and I'll bring them by tomorrow. May I leave? Please. Oh, do I love doing that. You were great, baby. That Hausfrau place, that was good. - Do you want to go back there? - Yeah. I'm sure you're starving after all the digs and the jabs. You go, boy. You must have really just worked up an appetite. - It was just business. - No, it is good business. Boy, you didn't even have to search for those insults. Just went-- would just drop-- right out of the mouth, didn't it? - Grace? - You know, I'm impressed. The way you just cut right to the heart. ( mimics arrow shot ) Bull's-eye! You got me! You got all of me. The hair, the empty head. I'm just surprised you didn't go after my big feet. That would of knocked off what, another 20 bucks? I don't believe you. Come on, Grace. That was a ruse to get him to lower the price-- a gambit, a canard. So what you're saying is that you didn't mean any of it. Where is this coming from? You don't think I'm a good businesswoman. - Grace. - Say it. Say, "Grace, you're a good businesswoman." - I want to hear you say the words. - Come on, Grace. - Let's-- - Say it. If you believe it, you should have no trouble saying it. Do you think I'm a good businesswoman? That is such a loaded-- It's hard to say, is a person a-- I didn't think so. I've been waiting for those hands all day. Karen, you're wearing me out. When am I gonna have time to study the parts of the body? So far, I only know phalanges, and that's just 'cause I like saying "phalanges." Honey, I don't want to hear it! Just do what you do, and do it to my deltoids. This mama's like a rock. And I don't want you massaging anyone else. You belong to me now. - Don't hate me. - Don't talk to me. - I have to talk to you. - I have to hate you. How long are you gonna stay mad at me? I was doing what you asked me to do. Did I or did I not get you the lowest possible price? - You're still hating me. - You're still talking to me. Okay, that's him. Now, just sign the papers, and hate me at a more appropriate time, Iike when I shave with your Epilady. Let's get right down to business, shall we? Here is the new purchase price agreement that we've agreed upon, correct? Correct. Now, if I can just get a signature. It's okay, Grace. You can sign it. - No. - I beg your pardon? - I'm not signing anything. - Grace, please sign it. This was supposed to be easy, and fun, Iike the TV Guide crossword puzzle. Who are they kidding? "Close Encounter of the blank Kind"? But, this hasn't been easy or fun, and I'm-- I just don't feel good about it anymore. Grace? Time to take off your exposed nerve hat, and put on your business bonnet. You know what? I'm sorry. I can't just turn it on and off like you. If you prick me, I bleed, and right now, I am bleeding because of a particularly unforgivable prick. Maybe I should come back another time. - Why don't you do that? - I can't come back another time. I'm leaving for London in the morning. I need this signed. And she'll sign it. Grace? You know what the funny part is? There is no funny part. My life is so unfunny, Mr. Hutt, it's not even-- funny! What am I doing taking on a mortgage? My life is already a mess. I'm still renting an apartment, I don't have a driver's license, I'm not married, I live with a gay guy-- Grace? I haven't had sex in five months! And I was in Bloomingdales this morning waiting on line to buy wrinkle cream, and this Jennifer Love Michelle Sarah Felicity-looking thing bumps into me and says, "Excuse me, ma'am!" Grace? Gracie, it is not worth it. Don't buy the place if it's gonna make you feel like this. Do I look like a ma'am? Miss Adler, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. No, Mr. Hutt, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you had to see me like this. Miss Adler, about this contract? No, no. I can't right now. I just-- I can't. Grace, you may-- Miss Adler, it's not much, but perhaps I could lower the price a bit more. Think about it. All right? Now look at me and tell me I'm not a good businesswoman. Oh, you're early. I haven't even had time for a steam and scrub. I guess you'll just have to touch me dirty. Blow. Where's your table? I didn't bring it. But what do you mean, you didn't bring it? I'm tired of being just a pair of hands to you, Karen. Oh, but you're so much more than that, Jack. Why, you're elbows and forearms and thumbs and wrists, and-- Stop it! It's over! Over? Who do you think you are? It's not over until I say it is. I'm paying you good money. What? You want to go back to serving shrimp puffs at museum fundraisers? I didn't think so. So I'm going in there, and take off my clothes, and when I come back, we're just gonna do it! No! Karen, I can't do it anymore. Every day I come in here, and I touch your naked body. We don't talk, there's no emotion. I'm acting like a straight guy, and it's making me sick. I took an oath in front of God, and my mother! I'm here, I'm queer, get used to it. Oh! Oh, what do I see? Is that a five? Allow me. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! That'll be $1,700, please. - I have a pink five. - Oo-ooh. I guess then you'll have to mortgage that little tenement on skid row. Sucks for you. Stick to Candyland, girlie. What is it with you? Why is it every time money and property are involved, - you turn into a-- - Skillful, savvy negotiator? Mine only had four letters in it, but yeah. It's the way I have to do it. Let's face it, I'm not the kind of guy that hammers out a contract on the 18th hole or closes a deal over brewskis at Billy's Topless. First of all, who closes a deal at Billy's Topless, except maybe Billy? And second of all, don't tell me that you're gonna pull out the gay card. - It is a lot harder for a gay man-- - Because if you're pulling out the gay card, I'm pulling out the girl card, and we both know that the girl card trumps the gay card. Don't make me get my friend Joni over here. Because we both know that the only card that trumps the girl card is the gay girl card. Okay, I'm not losing this. I will call Jill, my African-American, bi-curious, dyslexic-- forget it, I'm exhausted. I fold. That's a good move, because I happen to know a differently-abled transsexual with split ends, and that beats the house, mister.   
                




                    			Okay, she's a lawyer, and she pees with men. - Ally McBeal, click. - Yes. Oh! I can't stand him. - Dennis Miller. - Yes. A female singer. Really, really skinny. Everybody that ever performed at Lilith Fair? Gonna need more. If she misses her next meal, her "heart won't go on." - Celine Dion! - Yes! And time is up. - Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-- - Hoo. Okay, so let's see. We've got 30, and you have 217. Hey! So you're in second place. - Can I get a refill? - Coming up. You know Celine Dion was on Oprah the other day? Harry and I watched it together. How cute is that? - I swear, he likes it. - Our Lindsay doesn't like TV. She'd rather go to the park, play with her little friends. Hey, how about those Knicks? See how desperate I am to change the subject? - I'm referencing sports. - You're right. - Sorry. - Just one more little thing. Harry caught a ball for the first time and I got it on videotape. Oh my God, you got it on videotape? Will, she got it on videotape. You didn't get it on videotape by any chance, did you? Honey, you play favorites, and I think Riley knows it. - No, I don't play favorites. - You play favorites. No, she just annoys me. The bitch fights me when I put her in my car. - You have to call her a bitch? - She's a bitch, Rob. Do you have to call her a bitch? Do we have to spend another evening talking about everybody's dogs? You just feel guilty 'cause I'm ready for one and you're not. Now, that's just Grace's way of saying that her biological clock is barking. You don't have to breed. There are lots of options. You can adopt. Hey, look at the time! It's a quarter to get out! Grace: I can't believe I let you drive me here, Jack. - Will doesn't want a dog. - I know, I know. Please, listen. I just spent the last about the evils of smells, stains, drooling and shedding. I said, "It didn't seem to bother your ex-boyfriend." Oh, look. A Lhasa apso. Hello, my little poop. Hello, my little smelly poop. Honey, honey, the puppy talk. Really trying to keep the crab cakes down. But look how sweet he is, sitting in his bowl. Yeah, he's gifted. Look, just pick one! Spay him, spray him, throw him in a bag, and let's get out of here! No. I told you, I can't get a dog. Oh, come on, Grace. You have to for Will's sake. My God. They're total guy magnets. I once had a golden retriever and the man candy he retrieved golden! Ruff! Look, a Chihuahua. - Oh, he's looking right at me. - Honey, he's got cataracts. He's looking at two to three months, tops. Buenas noches. Oh my God. I am done. Honey, come on. What's the problem? You can have anything you want. You just have to learn to compromise. Take me and Stan. If he wants a little touchy-touchy, well, if I cooperate, then I get a house in the Bahamas! It's tit for tat. I'm not sure what you're asking me to do here. Just pick out a freaking dog, Grace. - Hi. - Hey. Got Thai food again. Mainly because I'm obsessed with the Yum Yai salad. It announces its own goodness right in its name. Yum Yai. You're kind of a geek. Help me out here. What's a four-letter word for elevator man? Otis. Whoa, you're smart. I got a dog. What?! Yeah, you're really smart. You must have gotten really high scores on your SATs. Grace! He is the best. You're gonna love him. He is so cute. He even looks like you. He's got your eyes. Damn it, Grace, I said no. - And your fangs. - Where is he? He is somewhere taking up no space and being absolutely delightful. Come on, Will, give it a chance. The woman at the adoption center said we can keep him for a week and then decide. Grace, it's a dog, not the Ronco Fry Daddy. - Come on, Eileen! - All right, you-- You do what you want, but I just don't think it's fair to ask a dog to sleep outside, when it's this cold out. Will, the dog's not gonna sleep outside. Oh, really? 'Cause I figured you'd want some company. Fine. Forget it. - You're weird and inhuman. - Grace, don't make a big thing-- - I told you I wasn't into dogs. - Whatever! Never mind. I'll bring him back tomorrow. Thank you. Is that him? No. It's veteran character actor Charles Durning. Can you just watch him, just for a minute? He just had some first-day jitters in my bathroom. I just wish you'd understand where I'm coming from. When I said I wasn't a dog person, I meant it. Her-roh. Oh, you had me at her-roh. You had me at her-roh. Can we just talk about how many cute guys were swarming around you at the park? They just wanted to see my sweet bundle of love. Yes, they did. Did you believe when he almost caught that Frisbee? Oh, that was my fault. I threw it too high. By the way, I don't think it's such a great idea that you yell at him like that in front of the other dogs. A light and breezy tone just doesn't cut it when he's eating a woman's blood-pressure medicine. No, no, I understand that. It's just that you shamed him. Will, you can't shame dogs. They're not defendants on Judge Judy. You pointed at him with the little witchy-poo finger, and you yelled at him in front of his friends. - His friends? - Whatever. The point is you're just-- you gotta relax, and give him a chance to be who he is. These are important years. He's gotta develop a sense of himself. Will, I'm not your mother. And I promise, if he's gay, I won't stand in his way. You thirsty? You want some Evian? Come on, boy. Get your Evian. Here. I'm gonna go take a shower. I meant to tell you, I enrolled him in doggie day care. Wait, what day care? The Yuppy Puppy. The Yuppy Puppy? Day care for the urban professional's dog. Do you know these people? I don't know these people. I don't want a stranger raising my dog. Didn't you see that thing on "Dateline," when that woman was hitting the dog on the snout with his squeaky lambchop? Will, that was not Yuppy Puppy and it wasn't "Dateline." It was "Animals Do The Darndest Things." I'm sorry, but I think it's best that you stay home tomorrow, and take care of him. Doink! Okay, Master. I will be home anyway, because I'm having the sofa in my bottle reupholstered. Get over yourself! I'm working, too! Fine, Sarcasmo. I'll take him to work tomorrow, and you can take him the day after. - I'll walk him in the morning. - I'll walk him after work. And I'm gonna want him every other weekend, and all the Jewish holidays. Harlin, I would strongly advocate cash funding in lieu of a stock swap. Yes, that liver is nummy, isn't it? It's nummy. Because the PIE ratio really points out the inflated value of the company, don't you think? I don't know, Will. Nummy seems a little strong. I think I'd go with tasty-wasty. You like some water, boy? Gulp, gulp, gulp It's funny, I've never thought of myself as a dog person. That's right. You people like the cats. And by "you people," you mean? Lawyers, of course. Let me take that prospectus with me on the plane. Got it right here. I am so sorry. Mergers make him really nervous. Don't be mad. Oh, I'm not mad, Will. I'm just a little pissed. Grace, the bitch we hate is on line one. Hi. Yes, the fabric just came in, and it is absolutely gorgeous. Yes, I know it's taken forever, but that is the price you pay for imported silk damask. Yeah, that and $2,000 a yard. No, you're right. That's not funny. No, but the great thing is that we have enough for the chair, the ottoman and settee, so we can get started right away and-- bad! Bad! Bad! No, no, no I wasn't talking about you. I was talking about my assistant. Bad! Bad! Horrible, horrible. Excuse me, can you just hold on a second? Thank you. Okay, baby. Baby? Let go, sweetie. This-- no, this is not a game. Okay, let go, let go, let go! Hi, honey. This is Karen, Grace's assistant. Listen, rumor has it silk damask is out. Yeah. Who do I love? Who do I love so much I want to drop-kick? Who, boy? Who? Who, who? Who, who, who? - Hi. - Hi. May I bite your snoots? May I bite your snoots from loves? Please stop pluralizing everything. But he's so cutes! Look at mes. I can't believe you are still playing with the puppy. We've been home for three hours, and you haven't moved. - So what? - So it's a little obsessive. - No, it's not. - Oh, really? On the cab ride home, I noticed you had puppy breath. He made the first move. - You and I are going out tonight. - How can we go out? Okay, guys, we're here. Get out. What are you two doing here? We're the babysitters. Mr. Truman, I hope you don't mind, but I like brought my girlfriend Valerie here so we can make out. You and I are going to a movie. I asked Jack to babysit the puppy, and, Karen, what are you doing here? Oh, Jack asked me. It was either this, or my neighborhood watch meeting, and if I have to hear Marlo Thomas one more time-- "Phil recycles this, Phil recycles that." Oh, yeah. I feel good about this, Ieaving our puppy with Cruella DeVille. And Karen. Will, we need this. We haven't gone out in a week. We're like 100 cans of peas, and some racist literature away from being survivalists. I'm going to get my coat. Okay, so what are we calling him now? We're still not sure. I like Otto. Oh, fat dog. Like father, like son. What would you suggest, Jack? I don't know. I was thinking something more along the lines of Jack. Let me think. "Jack, quit licking that man's face." He'd never know who I was talking to. Oh, my side. Okay, let's go. I want to stop by the ATM for 100 bucks so I can get Goobers. Now, Gracie, you go, although I think it's best I stay here. No, honey, go. Go on, have a good time. We'll take good care of your place. And your little dog, too. He's kidding. Okay? Come on, let's go. Will? Come on. Come on, baby. Come on, Will. Here, fetch, Will. Okay. Fine, but I'm taking my cell phone. You call if you need anything. The vet's number's on the fridge. Play him some music. He likes REM, but the early stuff, nothing after he shaved his head. Did they say feed him now or later? Forget the pooch, where's the hooch?! I noticed you bought the cheap kibble. What's with that? Will, this is supposed to be our night out. - Can we watch the movie, please? - Oh, fine, fine. You told them where the Snausages were, right? They'll find 'em, they'll find 'em. I left some in every drawer just in case. Snausages. - Is this seat taken? - No, knock yourself out. Hey, hi. Remember, we met at John Canalie's party? Oh, yeah. I remember. Jack knows how to use the retractable leash, doesn't he? Hello, Father Will. Cute and interested at 9:00. Jack: Do "The Hustle." ( mimics song beat ) Hey, look Karen. We're at Studio 54. Hi, Liza. Hi, Mischa. And look now, there's Bianca. Woo! Honey, I'm so glad I took it upon myself to thin out Grace's closet. I just could not let her go on thinking she could pull off yellow. Grace. A skort? Rosario, this is your lucky day. Oh, oops. Here, puppy. Here, puppy. Pace yourself, Cujo. What time is it? Oh my God, it's 11 :00. - Where's his leash? - What? Why? What's going on? What's happening? What are you telling me? Well, it's last call. This is when all the hotties take their dogs out for a final poop-n-cruise. All right, I guess I'll head home. Time to pay for that house in the Bahamas. All right, pup, it's show time. And focus, Uncle Jack needs a new pair of shoes, preferably with a 6' gorgeous hunk o' man in them. Hello, Jack? Kare-- I knew we shouldn't have left him with those two. It was like letting the Von Bulows babysit. They're probably out walking him. I cannot believe you could not sit through a 90-minute movie. Forgive me for caring about the dog. Are you implying that I don't care about the dog? - You treat him like he's a-- - Dog? He is a dog, not the Lindbergh baby. I know he's a-- oh my God. He left his chewy boot. - Will? - This is his transition object. - Wow. You are obsessed. - No, I'm not. - Gimme your wallet. - What? Gimme your wallet. Don't know what that's gonna prove. You are carrying around a picture of your dog in your wallet. You weirdo! I love this dog! We totally bonded. We just sat there together in the park. He checked out butts, I checked out butts. Where have you been? You better not have taken this dog to Boylesque. Because God forbid he see a half-naked man, given that he is a completely naked dog! Let's take a dysfunction reading in the room, shall we? Oh, yeah, the wind's a' blowin'. George, Martha, we'll be in the kitchen eating the free food. Let us know when it's intermission. - I'll be joining you. - Oh, of course. So you can obsessively monitor every milligram that he eats. I think you've got me confused with your mother. I would be very careful about opening the mom-bashing door. I've got a lotta bullets in my belt. Please stop the fighting. I simply can't take the fighting. Oh, it's not your fault, little one. Sometimes bad people happen to good dogs. - You know what I think this is? - Yeah, I do. I think you think that it's about me wanting a kid, or something Sally Jessy stupid like that. - You need to go out on a date. - What? You need to be giving all this love and affection to something that's, I don't know, paper trained? Go on a date, Will. It's time. You already have your pickup line, "May I bite your snoots from loves?" Men were all over you at the park. A cutie sat right next to you in the movie theater and all you were interested in are Liver Snaps. Snausages. Whatever, same food group. You don't need another reason not to be open to-- Okay, okay, okay. Message received. - Even if that is true-- - It is. - Even if it is-- - It is. Boy, you're tough. We still have a bigger problem. I know. I can't take him to work every day. What about going back to my idea of doggie day care? No, I just can't do that to a puppy. It's not fair. Then what are you suggesting? He deserves to be with someone who can spend tons of time with him. Who do we know that has that much time on his hands? You know, I'm not very fond of blondes, but you are fabulous.   
                




                    			What are you doing? It's freezing. Come on. My God, it looks like I'm hiding push-pins in my T-shirt. Ladies and gentlemen, Grace, unplugged. I would have laughed if I were warm, - and that was funny. - Come on. - Stand on the vent. - Oh my God. Just when I'd given up hope, heat. I'm in heat. Oo-ooh. Keep it up, Grace. You're this far from pay-per-view. How did you do it? I bribed the super to fix the heating vent. His English isn't so great, but I think the deal is one of us has to sleep with him. I'll do it, as long as it's on top of this vent. Hey, hey, hey, don't bogart the warm. I need to thaw my feet. Oh, yeah. That's the stuff. Give it to me, baby. Keep it coming! Feel the heat! Would you two like to be alone? Man: Mm-mm, you taste good. Excuse me? Shh, listen. Woman: That was amazing. Man: God, the candlelight on your face. You're beautiful. Woman: You make me feel beautiful. Man, even disembodied voices are getting more action than I am. It's sweet. I can't help but take it personally. Woman: Mm-mm. She "mm-mm-ed." Okay, now she's just throwing it in my face. Woman: Oh my God. It's almost one. Dennis? Dennis, stop. My husband's gonna be home any minute. Both: Husband? Woman: I can't live like this anymore. Well, he can't either. - Husband: Well, I can't either. - Huh? See? Careful, girlie. You're gonna end up with waffle face. This is pathetic, Grace. What, you come home early just to catch "Days Of Our Vent"? No. I thought I would cook shepherd's pie. Pray tell, Julia Child, what's in shepherd's pie? Shepherds? Sheep? Pie? Sounds like a crock o' sheep to me. Who cares about shepherd's pie? The poor husband slaves away while she carries on an affair every day this week-- - except Wednesday. - Which, ironically, is hump day. You should hear her with the boyfriend. She does this whole "of-ten" and "hwhere" thing. And with her husband, it's "often" and "where." She's gross. I think the husband is totally on to her. Woman: I told you I'm not seeing anyone. Oh! Ooey is such a liar! - How could she lie like that? - I don't know. Why don't you ask her up for some shepherd's pie, and ask her? Wait a minute. Her name is Ooey? No, it's just that they're always walking out of the room when he says her name, so all I get is "Ooey." What do you think of my glasses? What do they say? They say, "Guys don't make passes at girls who wear glasses." And guys don't make passes at guys with fat asses. I think they make me look smart. It's the intellectual equivalent of stuffing a sock in your pants. ( mimics O'Jays song ) Funny-funny-funny-funny, funny! Grace, what are you doing? I'm listening to the couple downstairs. Fine, don't tell me. I'm ready for you to read my play. Wait, whoa. What play? You're a writer now? Sarcasm noted and quickly forgotten. Bye-bye. For your information, I've been taking a playwriting class at the Learning Annex. That explains the scathing "fat ass" retort. Okay, you know what? Let's just forget it, and have dinner, and you'll read it after I leave. - Dinner? - Yeah. Will invited me to dinner. You were there, Grace. Don't you remember? We discussed you making your famous moist-free chicken. Oh, no. Oh, that's right. - Jack, I am so-- - Woman: No. Oh my God, did you hear that "no"? Evil, thy name is Ooey. I forgot too. I'm sorry. Apology accepted. Promise me you'll both read this, okay? I need notes prontito. I'm having a stage reading Tuesday and I'm a little anxious about it. - Will: Tuesday, no problem. - Grace: All right, whatever. You want to try that one more time with feeling? - Tuesday, no problem. - All right, whatever. Great. That's the kind of enthusiasm I'm looking for. Don't forget we're on for Lady Bunny and her All-Boy Revue on Friday. - Don't blow me off. - I won't. If you're gonna think about blowing me off, do not blow me off. - I won't. - It's Friday. Don't blow me off. "Repetitious and repetitious," said the New York Times. You queens really do know theatre. Rosario. Hi, honey. Listen, I'm running a little late. Yeah, things are muey loco at the oficina. I'm gonna need you to feed the kids and read them something before bedtime. I don't know, honey, why don't you read 'em that book they love, "Green Eggs And I'm Hammered." No, Rosario. Now why would I want to speak to them? What? I just-- hola. - Hi. - Hi. - Outfit? - Custom. - Perfection. - I know. - I'm freaking out about my play. - Honey, come here. I don't produce theatre. I am theatre! Please, Karen, I need your help. You were so instrumental in the success of my one-man show, "Just Jack." Remember how nervous I was before "Just Jack"? But you were there to support me, and coach me, - and make me Just Jack. - Just shut up! All right, criminy. Let me see the material. "Love Among The Coconuts: A Caribbean Fantasy"? I dunno, honey. Sounds like a dessert that repeats. Tomorrow, I'm casting the role of Plantain, a magnificently built island man who wears nothing but pooka shells and a palm frond. I'll pick you up. Grace! I'm just leaving for work. - It's 6:00, crazy. - Oh, I'm late. So now you're skipping work altogether? - I called in sick. - Called who? You're the boss. I know. It was a strange conversation. If I do it again, I'm gonna fire me. Grace? Will, I had to. Ooey got into a huge fight with Thomas. - Who's Thomas? - Her husband! - Oh, for-- - Oh, it was so good! She came home, and he was like, "Where have you been?" And she's all, "I don't have to answer that." And he's like, "Oh, yes, you do." And then there was like That sounds even better than "The Real World: Seattle." I don't want to have this conversation anymore. - But, Will, I mean-- - No, no-no! Enough. No more. This is wrong, period. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go down to the laundry room. Never gesture emphatically with a taco in your hand. - Oliver Wendell Holmes? - Cesar Romero. - I just met Judy. - Who's Judy? - Ooey is Judy. - Judy is Ooey? Yes, it's-- it's truey. The guy she's having the affair with-- - Dennis. - Yeah. Thomas's brother. No! Ow. Yes, yes. It's ugly, it's sordid. Move over, I'm in. Okay, what'd I miss? It's so tragic. Her husband is out there saving lives at a hospital, while Slutina flits around the apartment - in a satin robe, having-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down there, church lady. First of all, Thomas is a dermatologist. He's not saving lives, he's popping zits. And second, he's been checked out of that relationship for two years now. Trust me, she's gonna leave him for Dennis. That would be totally immoral. It would break the commandment about-- coveting thy husband's brother's ass. Wow, I break that one all the time. I can't believe you blew me off. Where the hell were you? I just spent three hours in the freezing cold outside a drag bar being harassed by a pair of Rosemary Clooneys. - Why didn't you go in? - Because you have the tickets. - Oh. Sorry. Right here. - Oh great. Thanks a lot. A lot of good this is gonna do me. Lady Bunny and her All-Boy Revue have already de-wigged, de-glossed, and de-parted. Shh, shh, shh. She's back, she's back. Did you at least read my play? - I've been a little busy, Jack. - Judy: I can't take this anymore. You tell him, sweetheart. Wait a minute. This is your busy? Trust me, Jack. It's oddly riveting. Grace, what about you? Did you read it? - Agh-- - Oh, I see. I guess maintaining the 13 shades of red in your hair keeps you so busy you don't have any time for recreational reading. Jack, there is a marriage breaking up down there. - It's kind of important. - Y-ello? And I'm not? Believe me, you'll gain a little perspective next week, when you're, I don't know, studying to be a wet nurse, and you're script is lining the bottom of Guapo's birdcage. I can't-- w-- would-- did you-- Agh! Okay. Okay, that wasn't bad. I'm not sure if playing coy would be the way to go. But good job. Let's start-- oh, excuse me. Finally, my God, you're here. I'm a wreck. I can't get the scene to work, and it's very important. - I had something important, too. - I just had a facial at Yolanda's. I'm sorry. Yolanda's? I didn't know. Oh-- oh, Lord. Is that one person? He's auditioning for the part of Plantain. I thought you wanted an island native, not an island. He's the only guy that showed up for the audition, and I didn't have the heart to tell him he didn't get the part. Actually, I didn't have the guts to tell him. Can you-- All right, I'll take care of it. Hi. Listen-- Oh, honey, I think you got a little barbecue sauce, just-- There you go, there you go. Got it. Gotta remember to wear a bib when you're eating those dinosaur legs. I love this. But, you know, we feel that the character is coming off too-- Jewish. But listen, thanks for coming down. Watch the support beam, honey. We actually ran it a couple times. He wasn't bad. If you closed your eyes, he kinda had a Lou Diamond Phillips quality. It just wasn't working out. Maybe it was the actor. Jack, sit down. Listen, I finished reading your skittle on the treadmill this morning, and you got some bigger problems than your friend King Thong out there. What are you talking about? Your play stinks. It does? Well, which pages? The ones with words on them. "Come to me, Tonga, and let us make lup-lup on my houseboat." - No, honey, it's not good. - Karen, it's a Caribbean fantasy. It's a Caribbean nightmare! What am I gonna do? Write about what's important to you-- relationships, your family, your friends. - I'll take Painful Things for 500. - Exactly, honey. Yes! And when viewed in that light, why, your life is an embarrassment of riches. Thanks, Karen. I knew you'd make me feel better. Oh. Grace, major development in the vent. She's cooking him lamb. Lamb, Grace! It's so clear. She's leaving him tonight. - It's gonna get ugly. - It's gonna get good! We need ice cream. What flavor of ice cream goes with the destruction - of a loveless marriage? - Rocky road. No, no, no We have Jack's play tonight. We have to leave in less than 15 minutes. That's right. He's a writer this week. What are we gonna do? I wonder if she's started cooking the lamb yet. About 20 minutes in. - How do you do that? - It's a gift. Now, they're gonna have to start with some wine, right? He'll have one glass, she'll have 12. If she plans this right, she'll announce that she's leaving him right after the entree and then use dessert to lift his depression. Wait, that gives us what? An hour and a half?. We can make an appearance at Jack's play, and be back in time for the tearful breakup sex! Life is good. Where's Mr. Kot-ter? Wow. I haven't been in a classroom like this since Jimmy Johnson and l-- You know what? I'm not even gonna finish that sentence. I'm just gonna have a happy party in my head. Okay, everybody chop-chop. In your seats, we're about to begin. And lights. Yes. Hello, my name-- excuse me, you in the capped shirt? Yeah, I'm sorry, but when the hand goes up, the mouth goes shut, okay? Thanks, you're a button, okay. Anyway, my name is Jack McFarland, and tonight I will be showcasing scenes from my new play, "Untitled Jack McFarland Fall Project Entitled: Jack: A Meditation ln Three Parts." I guess "There's Something About Mary" was already taken. We open at a funeral. Not yet! ( grumbling ) Jack is dead, the victim of a wayward city bus. As we begin, his friends arrive to mourn his sudden passing. Now. Come on, Will, let's go. We've been here five minutes. Come on, Will, let's go. We've been here five minutes. Actor Will: Can we go? Yeah, we've paid our respects. Besides, our soaps are on. And I'd rather spend time with imaginary people I don't even know than this sweet dead man who devoted his life to us. I only read the first few pages, but something tells me this isn't Ieading to the scene where five Laotian houseboys face the pain of adolescence. - You want to play cards? - I don't care, whatever. Okay, five card stud. Jacks or better to open. Jack? I miss him so. Oh, it's no use. Everything we do just reminds us of Jack. If only we'd known this while he was still alive, we would have appreciated him more. The staging isn't much, but the subtlety of his language-- If only there was something that we could do to be with him again. Well, there is one thing. You're right. We're coming, Jack! Come on, don't bogart the poison. What did you do to Jack to make him so mad at you? Excuse me, I'm not drinking alone up there. Lights. We are now in the afterlife. All right, stand back. No pushing. Don't crowd the pearly gates. We can only let a few of you people in. All right, you, you, and you. You, in the acid-washed jeans, you're gonna have to wait a while. And honey, did you really think you could get into heaven wearing body glitter? Well, you can't. No, can't. Sorry. - Excuse me? - Name? Grace Adler and Will Truman. You're not on the list. Is Jack here? Can we speak to Jack? Well, he's here, honey, but he's way too busy. He is huge in heaven. You know what? Let me check the other list. Oh, yeah, Adler and Truman, right on the top. Wow. You two are downstairs, where there's lots of vents pushing up a lotta heat. Okay, enjoy your journey-- to hell! Cut! Print! Tony! I mean, curtain! Thank you all for coming, thank you. Oh my God. What did we do? I think it's more what we didn't do. I gotta talk to him. Yeah, 'cause if this thing's going to Broadway-- Okay, take care, guys. Kisses, okay? Jack? You guys are going to the cast party, right? I heard Pacino's gonna be there. I don't know if that's true or not. - We're sorry. - Yeah, well-- I feel terrible. We didn't pay attention-- - Words, words, words, Will. - Well, Jack? What can we do? What's it gonna take to get us out of hell? Of all the jackets you've given me tonight, I think-- yeah, this one's the best. Just needs to be taken in a little around the waist and the hips. Pretty much everywhere, so-- I still feel kind of funny about listening to them, but in a weird way, it makes me feel better about us. Yeah. Whatever problems you and I have, at least I'm not married to a gay guy. Jack: Missie, I'm gonna need a water bag for this chicken. Chop-chop.   
                




                    			- Good morning. - Bad morning. I just found a gray chest hair. It's so depressing. I went to bed young, I woke up Ari Onassis. ( speaking with Greek accent ) Jackie! Get on the boat! - I'm gonna have to see it. - Later, when I'm less vulnerable. - Will, it's one chest hair. - I only have seven. I don't like those odds. Listen to me, Pops. This isn't about the chest hair. It's about your birthday next week. No, it's about the chest hair. Okay, 90% chest hair, 10% birthday. - 80-20. - 60-40. Sold to the alte cacher in the kitchen. What do you want to do this year? I want you to have a fun birthday. Grace, you know me. I've never really been that into birthdays. That's not true. I've seen all your home movies. You've had some fun birthdays. Remember the one where your brothers dressed you up in your mom's clothes? That seemed like a fun birthday. That wasn't a birthday. That was like a Thursday. So glad my dad captured that one on film. The only worse thing on film was my eighth birthday party. You didn't see this one. I really wanted a cowboy party, you know, like a cowboy cake? I really loved cowboys. Still do, by the way. You don't have to tell me. I've seen the magazines. But no, no, no. My mom gave me a clown party. Ugh. I hate clowns. They think they're so funny. I just fake-smiled my way through the whole thing, and then when I realized there wasn't gonna be a cowboy cake, I snuck up to my room, and hid. Oh, Will. That's so-- "Party Of Five." What do you want to do this year? Let's go to a restaurant. Nothing big, something mellow. You, me, and Jack. - What was that? - Nothing. - You made a face. - Face? Hello? I'm standing right here within face viewing range. Okay, I don't think Jack likes me. What are you talking about? Jack loves you. No, Jack loves you. I came along with the deal. You're the hamburger, and I'm that little cup of coleslaw. You don't order it, but there it is on the plate. Gracie, all I want for my birthday is for you and Jack to get along. Deal. Let me see it. - Could be worse. - How? How could it be worse? Oh, come on, Grace! I'm eating breakfast! I need you to make a decision for me and I need you to make it now. Don't have the sex change. They never work out. - Jack: Say you're sorry. - Sorry. Okay, I've narrowed your birthday festivities down to a couple of choices. Pick one, - drinks and dancing at The Spear. - Oh, no. No, that bar is pure skank. It's no place to spend my birthday. It's more like a place to spend your birthday. Vicious, party of one. Vicious, party of one. Okay, second-- and this is the one I'm really pulling for-- you and me on a gay singles weekend cruise. Kind of a cruise to cruise. That's where I want to be, on a boat, in the middle of the ocean, surrounded by a 1000 lonely seasick queens weeping into their guacamole. All right. You know what, that's it. I'm done trying. Make your own kind of music, sing your own special song. Jack, don't make a big deal. All I want is a nice little dinner, just you, me and Grace. What's that? What's with the face? I don't like Grace. What are you talking about? You like Grace. I don't know, I'm sort of not into her right now. Sort of not into her? She's a person, not tandoori chicken. What's the problem? Ever since she's moved in, I never get any me time. Oh, Jack. All your time is me time. Can you try to make a little more effort with Grace, please? Fine, but for the record, I've made an effort. Do you think I actually enjoy debating velvet versus velour? - You love that stuff. - Hey, I'm not that gay. Yes, you are. It's good coffee, hm-mm? Really good. Grace, Jack hates flavored coffees, too. - Really? - Yeah. Jack, so do l. Will just told me that a minute ago. You know, guys, my birthday's not for a week. Let's save some of the merriment till then, huh? I know what we can do. Let's get "Entertainment Weekly," and play my favorite new game, - "Love Her, Hate Him." - I'm gonna watch TV. You're gonna be missing out. It's a fun game, Jack. I know it's fun. I invented it. - You hamburger, me coleslaw. - Come on, Gracie. It's your turn to be the official page turner-slash-pointer. Okay. - Jada Pinkett. - Hm-mm. - Hate her. - Wow, that's kinda harsh. - She's not really-- - Will, you know the rules, Iove or hate. No gray area, just like life. - Hate her. - Good boy. This is a fun Friday night. Love her. Love, love, love her. - Who is it? - Are you serious? - It's Michelle Kwan. - Who? Michelle who? Michelle Kwan, figure skater, Olympic silver medalist? Goddess on ice. - You like Michelle Kwan? - I love her. So do l! - She was so robbed at the Olympics! - Tell me about it. She's a billion times better than Tara Lipinski. Don't even get me started with that little witch. - She's cocky. - The cockiest. - Almost as cocky as Surya Bonaly. - Oh my God! - The best! Surya Bonaly! - Who? - Both: Surya Bonaly! - Jack: She's French. - She's powerful. - She's black. She wears blue eyeshadow, and does illegal backflips. She scares me. I crave her. - Want a cookie? - Yeah. Look at you two, huh? I knew you guys would connect. Just didn't think it would be over something as lame as ice skating. Excuse me? Yeah, excuse me? What's so lame about ice skating? Oh, everything. With the sappy music, the chiffon costumes. They put little matching fabric booties over their blades. Grace, I can't believe you're into it. Oh, but you can believe I'm into it? Hi, this is Grace Adler of Grace Adler Designs. I'd like a dinner reservation for three on Tuesday. It's my best friend's birth-- all booked up? Would it make a difference if I told you my best friend was Demi Moore? Believe me, I'm not crazy about her, either. Okay, bye. Hi, honey. Oh, look who's back from lunch just in time for dinner. Oh, honey, don't tell me. Tell those slow waiters at Barney's. What happened? What went on? Who stopped by? What did I miss? Well, I spent most of the afternoon trying to get a table at a good restaurant for Will's birthday. Honey, did you try Balthazar? Karen, Steak and Brew are spitting at me through the phone. How would get a table there? Grace, I am your assistant. - I may not be a whiz at the-- - Computer. - --or know how to work the-- - Fax. but, honey, I do know how to get where I need to be. - Now, hand me the-- - Phone. I would have gotten that one. Honey, what's this? Yeah, who's this? Uh-huh, well, get me Leanté. Tell him it's Karen Walker. Okay, I'm starting to get it. Oh, yeah, hi, honey. Listen to me, I need your best table for dinner on-- - Tuesday. - --Tuesday. - 9:00. - 9:00. - Three people. - Well, thank you, honey, I would love to come. - Three. - Oh, oh, no. No, wait. - Will just wanted to have-- - Problem, honey? Make it four. Will's friend Jack may come along, as well. Oh, fun. Make it four. Uh-huh. You, too. Gotta go. Yeah. Leanté, honey, I'm busy. The French, stinky and blah-hh. Put down the sports page and listen. You're only looking at the pictures anyway. That is not true. Hey, I'm a sports fan. I'm a sport-- Iook here, it says right here that the Steelers lost by 17 points to-- to these big guys with the big arms. Guess where we are having dinner on your birthday? - Gracie, I don't care where we-- - Balthazar. Wow, caring a little more. Great food, cute waiters, the oysters you love! I love the oysters I love. How did you get us in? Karen. That's why she has to come along with us. What? What's with the face? - Face? - Hello? I'm standing right here within face viewing range. Karen? I don't really have anything in common with Karen. I'll cancel. What am I saying? It's Balthazar. It'll be great. Cute waiters serving the oysters you love. You suppose I can get the oysters to serve the cute waiters I love? Smell this. Is it bad? It's got 12 more hours. - How can you know that? - It's a gift. You are so gonna be loving me. You, me, Will, Karen. Madison Square Garden: Champions On lce. - No. - Yes. - No! - Yes! Oh my God! Champions On lce! Oh my God! I've always wanted to go! - No! - Yes! How much are you loving me right now?! A lot! When?! When?! When are we gonna do this?! - Tuesday night. - When are we-- oh my God! - Tuesday night! - Yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God. No. No, wait. No, it's-- No. We can't go Tuesday night. It's Will's birthday. Oh. He doesn't care. He just wants us to get along. Plus it's a chance to see Rudy Galindo in tights. No. I don't want to force Will to do something he doesn't want to do. Grace, we can go. I don't care. No, sweetie, it's okay. It's not that big a deal. Not that big a deal? You just jumped into Jack's arms. The last time a woman did that-- a woman has never done that. Really, Will? You're sure? Then we can go to Balthazar's right after? Oh my God. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. - You're sure? - Yes! Yes, we're going. You, me, Jack, Karen. The lce Capades! - Both: Champions On lce. - Sorry. This is a far cry from Balthazar. Who do I have to tip to get out? Move! Legs, legs! Move! I'm here. I can't believe I'm here. It's all so wonderful. Pace yourself, Dorothy. It's the Zamboni machine. Where's the popcorn guy? If we're not gonna eat for two hours, I need popcorn. Well, happy birthday. Thanks. Here we are. Yup, here we are. Happy b-- oh, we covered that. So, how old are you? How old are you? Grace, honey! How are we doing over there? I'm doing great. Will, you okay? Can you see? Much as I need to. I don't want to get too close, I might get sequin blindness. Hey! It's a sport! People win medals, huh? I'd like to see you do a double axel, double loop, double lutz, Mr. Man. Oh, there he is. - Popcorn! - Lord, look at these people. Losers! Not you. Karen, you brought champagne? What are you doing? You don't drink at Champions On lce. Honey, don't think of it as drinking. Think of it as Mommy's little cotton candy. Will, you don't look like you're having fun. What are you talking about? I'm having a great time. Champions On lce. Woo! Let's kick some butt! What? You said it was a sport. Will, honey, maybe a couple of belts of champagne will create the illusion that you're having fun. Excuse me. I'm fine. Really, I just want a little popcorn. - ( Olympic anthem plays ) - Hey, popcorn! Oh my God. - I'm getting chills. - Will: Here he comes. Hey! Excuse me! He didn't hear me. Honey, I don't care. Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, please welcome the Champions On lce! There they are, skating in the dark. - I think I see Surya. - Don't tease me. Two-time Olympic silver medalist Elvis Stojko! Hey! Popcorn! Look at him! You wear those leather pants, Elvis! And United States Champion Rudy Galindo! Hey! He's my hero! He's the gay one! One? Up here, Rudy! Will, you don't seem like you're into this ice crap either. Not particularly, but Grace and Jack love it so much, I just wanted them to have a good time. But, honey, it's your birthday. - How about now? - Okay, now. Yup, we get it, Surya. You can skate. How much longer is Champions On lce? You mean Endless On lce? Pretty soon, I'd better be looking at some oysters on ice. I am starving. Skate faster! We have reservations! You're hating this, aren't you? Do you want to just go? No, no, no. You guys are having fun. That's all I want. That and maybe a little popcorn! Are you sure? 'Cause if you're not, then-- What?! What?! What, did I miss a backflip?! No, no, no. Triple toe, double loop. No flip yet. Maybe she won't do it. No, she's gonna do it. She didn't come all the way from France to not flip. - Vendor: Popcorn! - Yes, popcorn! I've been calling you for like an hour. So you were the one. I thought it was the 49,000 other people that are in here. You don't have any brie and crackers in that thing, do you? I'm warming your brie right now, lady. - Vendors. - Oh, this is like ancient. It's typical. My birthday. Can't get what I want. Never do. One year, I wanted this cool red fire engine. My mother got me a Water Wiggle. Decided it'd be more fun to slip and slide. More fun for who? Backflip, backflip. - God, she faked us out. - Hello! You just knocked the popcorn out of my hand! I'm sorry, honey. I'll get you another one. - Popcorn! - I don't want another popcorn! - I want that popcorn! - Popcorn! Grace, Grace, she's gonna do it. Took me two hours to get that guy's attention. - Jack: Grace, just-- - It is my birthday. You'd think I could get a little attention on my birthday! - Will? - Grace, Grace-- Uh-huh, oh, yeah, uh-huh, oh, yeah. Okay, and where did her legs go? Over her head! Okay, you have to admit that that was pretty da-- Will? - Where did Will go? - Oh, he left, honey. He left? What, are you insane? You're gonna miss Rudy. Honey, where are you going? Don't leave me here with these ice freaks! Honey, this shirt on you is heaven. Grace: Will? Will? All right, so I think I've got it now. When I ask and you say okay, and then I ask and you say okay, and then I ask and you say okay, it's really a cue to me to know that it's not okay. You see how easy it is? All right, just so we're clear. - You're insane. - I must be. Every year, I end up doing what I don't want to do in order to make everybody else happy. I'm still an eight-year-old-- an eight-year-old with gray chest hair. One. One gray chest hair. Actually, none. I tweezed it this morning. It was taunting me. Jack: Hello? Hello? Hi, guys. Yeah, I just came by to get my-- oh, here it is-- "Entertainment Weekly" magazine. Oh my God, what is that? A Rudy Galindo autograph? Well, I'll be a rat's ass. How did that get there? What'd you do, sign it yourself?. Didn't have to. - Should I wait downstairs or what? - Grace: Oh my God. Rudy Galindo. Rudy and I are gonna go for coffee and-- Oh, happy birthday. He does not look 46. Lotta work. Well, another memorable birthday for the books. - Goodnight. - Excuse me, mister. Your birthday's not over yet. What did you tell me you wanted more than anything when you were a little boy? You don't have a "Josie and the Pussycats" Iunchbox in there? Happy birthday, partner. My cowboy cake! - Look at him. - Do you love it? I love it so much I'm gonna sleep with it. Whatever gets you through the night. You know, you're not eight years old anymore. You can ask for what you really want. - All right, next year-- - Mm-hmm? I want a real cowboy.   
                




                    			So I go back in the bookstore this morning and I just ask him out. Good for you, Jack. You actually got a date without the use of a modem and the cybername "Butt Masterson." At least I'm using my hard drive, Celibizia. It was kind of romantic, though. Our hands touched as we reached for a copy of "The Making Of Beaches." Holy dirty apartment, Fatman! Yeah. Amazing, isn't it? You can practically feel the presence of Fred Sanford hovering above us. ( humming "Sanford & Son" theme ) Shut up, dummy! So what happened in here? Did Grace explode? No. It's the annual Sublime Design Showcase. Interior designers display their work for all these big design critics, and basically they decide who's hot and who's not. It's insanely competitive, and every year she takes a stab at it and never wins. She's the Susan Lucci of the design world. So we need to be really sensitive to that, okay? You know, I can't-- There's no-- It won't-- I'm sleeping! Wake me never! Looks like it's gonna be another disappointing year for La Lucci. Mmm-hmm. Oh, good! You're back! Here, smell this. Stinks, doesn't it? You were probably riding up in the elevator thinking, "What died?" Well, don't worry. It's just my creativity rotting and stinking in my skull. So you've had coffee? Then I started poppin' NoDoz. - Now I'm hating myself really fast. - Yeah. So I'm guessing the chocolate covered espresso beans were a bad idea. Oh, no-no. No-no-no. Give that to me. Maybe I can get so speedy, I'll actually go back in time. You know, to when I was actually good. Grace, look at this. This is good. Oh-- horrible. But you know what? I think I have finally pinpointed my problem. - I suck. - Grace you know how to do this. Yeah, when I am helping other people realize what they want. But when it's just me, nothing. I mean, I'm like one of those weird fish that you always see swimming next to the ass of a shark. That almost worked, didn't it? You were going for a whole parasite thing. I was with you. The point is - ( knocking on door ) - l have no vision. Grace, you have vision. Are you so blind you can't see that? Hi. I'm-- I'm April. The service sent me. Oh, great. I'm Will. - And uh - Hi. that mess over there is Grace. Grace? This is gonna cheer you up. A short brunette woman? Come on, Will. I tried that in college. Remember, it really wasn't my thing. Well, I hope you have your own cleaning supplies 'cause I'm not packin'. Little industry joke. Oh, that's a little industry laugh. Under the sink. Huh? - Will, what is this? - I got you a cleaning woman. I know you can only work when things are neat and clean and orderly. Uh, no, Anal Annie, that's you! It'll blow my vibe having someone puttering around while I'm trying to work. Excuse me, what vibe are we blowing here? You've been up for three days and all you've drawn is an outline of your hand, made into a turkey. It was supposed to be a cow. - See, I told you I suck! - No, honey, it's-- Look, see, it's a cow. All right, look. I've gotta go. She'll do her thing, she'll stay out of your way. You do yours and if you hit a rough spot, just-- It's easy, just think of your mother's taste, you know, and then go the other way. Uh, excuse me. This was crumbled up on the floor. You didn't want to throw this out, did you? Oh, uh, that's just um that's garbage. - Oh, really? - Mm-hm. Looks pretty good to me. What is it? It's a meditation room. It was an early, tragic idea. No, actually, the pop-up bidet was tragic. This is just bad. Bad, bad, bad. Oh, God. Hey, hey. Come on, get up. Let me show you something I learned in the Coast Guard. Come on. - Up-up-up. - No, no. No-no-no, come on, get up. Shhh First, you close your eyes. Then you get to a really quiet place. Breathe in. Calm and serene. You're peaceful. And let it out. ( screams ) You know, when we met at the bookstore, I have to say, I would never have guessed that you were a lawyer. Probably 'cause I look so young. Actually, I passed the bar the first time I took it, and um, funny story, John-John was taking it the same day I was. ( whispers ) For the third time. And what do you know, I mean, he just sits right down next to me, and this time, he passes. Uh, I'm not gonna say anything else. You're a smart guy, Alex. You connect the dots. So what kind of law do you practice? I don't practice, I just do. But I don't want to talk about me anymore. You're out of order. So how's grad school? Right now it's not bad. I mean, I'm working on my dissertation, and every now and then I get to meet a cute intellectual type at a bookstore. You do? Oh, me. Oh, I'm sorry. Of course, me the brainiac. Smarties love to staple. - Excuse me? - Will, you're here. Uh, well, it's about time. You call yourself an assistant?! Actually, no. I wouldn't either, given the way you just abandoned the phones like that. Alex, this is my assistant, Will. Will, I'm a lawyer and this is Alex. From the bookstore? - Oh, hi, Alex. - Hey. Sorry I'm late, Iawyer McFarland. The sign out front with your name on it must have fallen down. I've been looking everywhere for it. Right, uh, get that fixed immediately. Gotta give him somethin' to do. Alex, will you give me and Will a minute, please? - We gotta go over some uh-- - Torts? Uh, no, thanks. We're gonna go for Chinese. You know, I'll just-- I'll wait out front. - Nice to meet you, Will. - You, too. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. Please don't be mad, don't be mad. Just listen. I had to tell him I was something. I mean, he calls me today and wants to meet me in my office for lunch. How hot is that? Must be nice to have finally met someone that likes you for who you are. Yeah, it's nice, but listen. Please don't say anything. I promise I'll tell him. I've just got to find the right moment. Oh, maybe during lunch, you know, when he finds out that McFarland can't afford the McNuggets because he's a McLiar. - I hate myself. - Of course you do, honey. How could anybody be happy in bat mitzvah ruffles? Why don't you run home and change, hmm? I think we'll both feel better. I'm gonna have a quick cry in the swatch room. Honey, you still test-driving those anti-depressants? 'Cause I think it's time to buy. Am I in the right place, Grace Adler Designs? Right place, wrong outfit. What's it all about, honey? What's-- Well, I'm-- I'm April, Grace's cleaning lady. Cleaning la-- Honey we shouldn't be talking. Get to work. Start with that big table there. There's a phone in there somewhere. It's been ringin' all morning. It's driving me nuts. - April, what are you doing here? - Oh, you didn't leave the key for me. Oh, gosh. Sorry. Here it is. Hey hey hey hey hey, what are you doin'? You're giving the maid a key? You're gonna be buying your jewelry back from hobos. Karen, why don't you go to lunch? - Honey, it's 10:00 in the morning. - In Boston. Honey, that is so-- Eh-- okay. Oh, great, you're working on that piece you threw out yesterday. Yup, seeing if I can make it worse. I think I did it. Yup, designed a meditation room that could move the Dalai Lama to bitch-slap Richard Gere. Yawn. - Excuse me? - You're boring. I hate people getting down on themselves. You'd get down on yourself, too, if you had a-- If what? lf I had your talent? Uh-uh. When I'd get down on myself, my mom had this saying that always made me feel better. Let me see how she put it. Let see if I can get it right. Agh! Your mother wasn't Sam Kinnison by any chance, was she? Well, what does it say on your door? It doesn't say "Grace Adler Whines," it says "Grace Adler Designs," so quit beating yourself up and just do it. - But I can't-- - Do it! Do it! Okay, okay. You know, Mary Poppins got the same message across, but she did it in a nice little musical number. You're like-- you're like a spoonful of whup-ass. You know what I can do? I could add the element of scent-- an aromatherapy machine that would-- Tsk, stupid. People will think - Agh! - l'm brilliant. God, can't we just trade her in for a buzzer? 'Morning, ladies Karen. Okay, you bring April to work once, I can accept that. Twice, no problem. I can fold my own socks, but five days a week? I've got mold on my shower curtain that is in escrow. Will, I can't explain it, but whenever she's around, I get the most amazing ideas. Will, you have to trust me on this. I can't do this without her. Let me get this straight. You can't design without our maid? - Exactly. - Yeah. No, I've heard about this. It's called the Hazel Syndrome. Yeah. They'll explain it all to you in the nervous hospital, Blanche. "Yeah, these fingernails'll have to be trimmed." You're a brilliant designer. Why do you need this? I just do. Why can't you be a little more supportive about it? Okay, here's me being supportive: Grace, you're a little-- ( whistles "Cuckoo" ) Okay? You're relying on our maid to do your job. Did Mr. Brady ask Alice to help with the architecture?! I've got your number, sister. I've seen "All About Eve." - Who? - "Poor Eve." Yeah, that's right, go ahead. Play the poor, naive little maid with the heart of gold. But I've got Grace's back! Trust me, you're not going to win the Tony in this version. I don't know what you're talking about? I just want to help Grace. Oh you're good. Get up, get up, get up, get up! He's gonna be here any minute. - Who? - Don't play games with me! Alex. Come on, Will, he's the one. I'm sure of it this time. I thought Robert was the one. Robert was cute. I should call him. Get up, get up! I thought you were gonna tell Alex that you are not a lawyer. I lied. Forgive me. I was in character. Why should I do this? Look at me, Will. Think of how many funny little Jack stories you can spin out of this predicament. This is grade-A fodder for a bitch like you. Have a seat, boss. - Okay, how do I look? - Great. Who'd have thought that you could put clothes on that fast? Amazing. Excuse me, Mr. Lawyer, is this your bike lock? Excuse me, can I just be alone in my office for a minute please? Sure. No, I just thought, you know, with your bike lock here and your bike out there, as a good assistant, I should mention that. Damn it! Oh! Alex! Kill time! So much fodder, so little time. Alex, come on in. Jack's just locking up a deal. He'll be-- he'll back in. So-- what's uh, Jack like as a boss? Imperious. Very much the queen bee. Oh, Alex, what a surprise. Uh, I'm a little out of breath. Oh? Hung jury? You're a pig, get out. Oh, the pants. Uh, yeah, I'm just uh, running from case to case. - So, how you doin'? - I'm okay. Great, let me just check my call sheet and we'll grab a little lunch. Actually, I just want to talk to you. Uh, listen, Jack. You're a great guy, but-- I'm getting the "great guy, but" speech, huh? It's just that you and I are in such different places in our lives. I'm kinda lost and aimless. I've got a new job every couple of weeks. You're like this buttoned up professional-- stable, mature, goal-oriented, responsible. Oh, no. I'm not a lawyer, I'm a liar. Jack, it's not gonna work out. All right, I see. Then I think you should go. I've got a lot on my plate right now, and I'd probably break your heart. - Anyway-- - Listen, one more thing. It's a little awkward, but I wondered if you could fix me up with your assistant. My as-- Will? - No - I mean, he just seem a little lost Iike me, and l-- I kind of like that. He's straight. Where is she? Where is April? "Poor Eve." Would you stop doing that? She knows it's this evening. Where could she be? I can't say that I'm surprised. I mean, you can take the maid out of the house, but you can't take the Karen, if this is you helping, stop helping. Well, l-- You know what those rocks need? A little Scotch. Listen, Grace, l I just wanted to point out that after all of your "April this" and "April that," who is here for you in your hour of need? Me. Huh? And who will always be there for you? Huh, what? Oh? Oh, yeah, it's me. Thank you, Karen. - I really appreciate it. - Anyway, look, I gotta run. I got a salt scrub in an hour. This is wrong. It's all wrong. And you, you are so wrong there. Talking to pillows? Wow, you're like the Doctor Doolittle of furniture. What are you doing? We had five different options for a floor plan. April was supposed to be here early so we could agree on one. I've had to do it all by myself, and look, look. It's crap. - It's fantastic. - Oh, what do you know? Well, maybe a little bit more than the maid. I am gay, after all. Maybe I should try the second choice. - Help me move the Tansu chest. - No. Grace, what are you doing? Just leave it. It's gonna look better over here. Would you leave it where it is? Stop it! Why do I feel like I'm in a shooting gallery? Ach! Screens? What was I thinking? It's like a bad Chinese restaurant. Okay, getting a little angry here in the meditation room. - Is that what you were going for? - If you want to help me, you will get April on the phone. Well, you can stop saying that because she's not coming. - How do you know? - Because I paid her not to come. - What? - You don't need her, Grace. You did this whole room yourself. You paid April not to come? Oh my-- Okay, Will, tell me. How much does my public humiliation go for these days? for a free mop. Look, you're being ridiculous. She didn't do anything, except go "Agh!" Oh, don't you dare mock the "Agh!" I have no connection to the "Agh!" You resent the "Agh!" - You fear the "Agh!" - Okay, look. I'm gonna stop doing this right now, because frankly, it's a little embarrassing. You're brilliant. I've told you this all week long, but for whatever reason, you won't listen to me. Will, you are wrong! This isn't good! - Actually, he's right. - Oh, who the hell are you? I'm the design critic from "East Coast Living." Welcome to my meditation space. Well, congratulations. You kicked boo-tay. Say it, "I kicked boo-tay." I kicked booty. I think now I sense you're going to thank me. Uh, no, because actually, I'm still mad at you. No, correction. You want to be mad at me, but you can't, because: A) I was right; but B) this meditation room is just too good. Peace. Oneness. Om. Thank you. Om. Let's go home. Why home? There's a rock in my bum. At least it's not your thumb. Now it's going numb.   
                




                    			I just met the cutest guy at the video store, shamelessly flirting with me through his girlfriend, but I picked up on it. - What movie did you get? - "Star Wars." Oh, again? Jack, I'm dreaming of Jabba the Hutt. That's 'cause you live with him. Anyways, I'm collecting data to put on the internet. The world should know the truth about C-3PO. Jack, C-3PO is not gay, he's British. Oh, R2. Come back here. My circuits burn for you. You really should get another hobby besides outing robots. He thinks every robot is gay. Uh, hello? "Lost ln Space"? "Danger, danger, Will Robinson." Big space queen. ( phone rings ) - Oh, I'll get it. - No. We're screeners. You don't screen when I call, do you? - No no, no - Never. Grace on machine: Hi, we're not in. Leave a message at the tone. - ( beeps ) - Woman: Hi, Grace. You should change your message. Have a little fun, like-- We're Will and Grace and we're not home, So leave a message on the phone Scooba-doo-biz-ah-doo-wah, oh yeah. ( chuckles ) Oh, I just made that up. Anyhoo, I'm coming to the Grand Apple for a few days It's the Big Apple. l'll see you when I get in, honey. Bye. Who the hell was that nut? That nut was my mother. "Danger, danger, Grace Adler." - Will, let's go over it again. - Gracie, I think you're ready. Will, my mother's coming in without my father, a.k.a. the buffer. I need to be prepared. Okay, mother shield up. Judgment deflector activated. Fire away. Honey, I'm just so thrilled about you and your little pillow store, but did I tell you the Schenectady Times said that my performance in "Rent" stole the show! Well, I'm not surprised. I mean, look at you, Mom. You were born to play an adolescent struggling with homelessness and heroin addiction. And uh, by the way, that little pillow store is actually a thriving enterprise-- ( beeping ) Getting a very high hostility reading. God, oh God, I'm goin' down. She-- she's gonna nail me. I could-- I bet you, within the first five seconds, - she's gonna be all over my-- - Hair? Nails? No. Okay, this is a little too much fun for you. - Love life? - No, stop it! She's gonna say that I'm ruining my life, that I'm never gonna meet anyone because I'm living with a gay guy. A gay guy? ls he cute? - Not at the moment. - ( knocking on door) Okay, deep breath. Chin up. You always part your hair like that? I'm kidding, the hair is good. You'll be swell, you'll be great! You can have the whole world on a plate! Will, I think my mother's here. Come on, darling. Give mother a hug. Mmm, you look gorgeous. Change the shoes. Shoes? How could I miss that? Is it my imagination, or do you get handsomer and handsomer? No, it's true. I get handsomer by the minute. I've got time-lapse photos that would amaze you. Grace, Grace, how do you like my new suit? Look, look, look, no panty line, because no panties. Oh, there was just no preparing for that one. Mmm, mini-muffins. They think they're so cute. Hmm. Someone sent those to the house for Rosario, but she's in the hospital having her stomach stapled, so I don't think she'll be needing them. Your maid is having her stomach stapled? No, honey, I'm having her stomach stapled. Good morning, good morning. Come on, girls. Jump in. Ma, there's no singing here. It's great to stay up late-- Both:  Good morning, good morning to you. Woo! Mmm, honey, I love you. Oh, honey, so do l. Oh, let's go shopping. We'll spend your dowry. Might as well put it to some use. ( nervous laughter ) All right. Okay, Mom, but before we go, get it out. What? What you've been dying to tell me ever since you got here. Oh, let's see, I did the uh-- I did the office, I did the shoes What'd I leave out? Oh, um, hair, make-up, combination skin Hello? You work for me. That's what I'm doin', honey. Honey, just tell me what you want me to criticize, and I'll do it. I want you to be happy. Okay, Mom, uh, you want to tell me that I should get my own place because I'm wasting my life and my time living with a gay man, so come on, tell me. And why would I say that? Will's great. I think you should live with Will as long as you want. Okay, I don't know what kind of sick game you're playing, lady, but I want no part of it. There's no game, dear. I love Will. As a matter of fact, what would really make me happy is if the two of you got married. I'd like to see that one. Wait, wait. What? Mom? Mom, Will is gay. Oh, I know that. I'm in the theatre. That's why it's so perfect. You know, how long do you think the sex thing is going to last? Hmm? You see, the best relationship ends up like the two of you are now, good friends. So jump in. I think a June wedding. I'd like to go strapless. Well, that would certainly fit in with no panties. - Mom, you're insane. - Why? You know, I think that you may even have topped the time that you came on to my prom date as Zsa Zsa Gabor. Oh, but darling, I adored his ruffled shirt. Ladies and gentlemen, fresh from 45 minutes of buttrobics, I give you my ass. You must be Jack. And you must be-- Bobbi Adler? Of course. Fabuloso Jewess from Schenectady. Loving you! Loving your whole tribe. Come here. - Ooh-- - Gimme a kiss. Oh-- Uh, well, we'll start with that. Anybody want to touch, feel, poke? Caress? Only if I can get a Silkwood scrub-down afterwards. I'll take a shot. Oh, you've done this before, haven't you? Okay, that just bought me five years on the couch. Come on, honey, we'll go shopping, and we'll get you a nice yellow blouse, on me. And since I hate yellow, that's exactly where it'll end up, on you. Ooh, free food. Well, thank God they're gone. Listen, Jack, I need to talk to you about somethin'. - It's kind of important. - I'm all ears, - and one high butt. - Yeah. Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story. A few weeks ago, it was Stan's birthday, and I forgot to get him a present. I mean, how am I supposed to remember something like that? Anyway, long story short, I think I might be pregnant. Oh, Karen, l-- I hope you don't forget my birthday. ( mimicking Mae West ) Okay, boys, last card. Down and dirty. And feel free to come down and get me dirty sometime. Hah! Gin! Well, I'll be darned, that is gin. It's too bad the rest of us are playing poker. Yeah, that is too bad. No, Karen, we're all playing poker, even you. Wow. The gays really love their rules. Whadya got, Jack? One pair of fabulous cheeks. Oh I got nothin'. Well, read 'em and weep, ladies. Full house, aces over 10s. Oh, poor little old me, and all I have is these little twos. - Oh. - Four of these little twos. Mother Adler wins again. I think I'll gonna have a drink. Who's with me? Martini, honey. And don't waste any space with those olives. Hang on. She'll have a ginger ale. Karen, we talked about this. ( cries ) Jack, I don't even know if I'm-- yet. When are you gonna take the-- Look, Mummenschanz, I don't want to take that test, okay? Honey, have you found yourself in a family way? Oh, no-no-no. But I think I might be pregnant. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Yeah, join the club. You know, honey, I think I liked you better with your hair straighter. Ching ching. Right off the Mom shield. Miss Kitty there is winning back your college tuition. Honey, would you tell him about the time I played poker with that Neil Farber and left him nothing but his skivvies? She left Neil Farber with nothing but his skivvies. Okay, everyone up to speed on that one? Good. Oh, by the way, Will, guess what Mrs. Bobbi Adler, the loin of my fruits, suggested to me this afternoon? Um, "Stop calling me the loin of your fruits"? No, honey. She said that you and Grace should get married. Grace and me? Married. - It was just a suggestion. - I think it's a wonderful idea. She'll make such a beautiful bride. Grace, you'll look pretty, too. Yeah, this would be us three weeks in. - Honey, I'm having an affair. - Me, too. - His name is Donald. - Me, too! Can't you just hear it? "Will, you may now kiss the beard." I mean, it's so absurd. Even if I was straight, I wouldn't marry Grace. What did Will mean by that? I mean, if I were gay, I would marry him. I mean, if I were a gay man and I lived in Amsterdam or ancient Greece. And-- you know what I mean. Well, honey, maybe you're just needy. When you're with a man, what you need to do is to find out - Oh, no, no, no - he-- he-- Thank you. Anything but relationship advice from you. - Why? - Ladies, are you ready to order? Uh, I'm not-- I'm not eating. - And your sister? - Sister? Well, honey, I mean, I love you. I'll have an order of you to go. Why don't I give you ladies a few minutes to decide? All right, that's cute, cute. Why won't I take your advice? That's why. What was I gonna do? lgnore him? He was flirting with him. It's my youthful skin. It's the only thing that dreadful grandmother of yours gave me. Mom? Mom, what I'm trying to say to you is that you always need to be the center of attention, in a restaurant, in your marriage. You always have to be the star. God cast me in the role. You know, Will has a theory about relationships. One person in the gardener, who tends, and the other person is the flower, who gets tended to. And, Mom, I say this with love, you're a big stinkin' rose. Sorry, ladies. My turn to be late. No, you're just in time. My daughter's hating me for lunch. - Ah. - I don't hate you. I hate you. This is gonna be a pleasant lunch. What's everybody having? I'm not eating, my mother's having the snapper, and why the hell wouldn't you marry me?! Can I at least have a bread stick first? Why wouldn't you marry me? You're just not my type of woman. Okay, I prefer someone taller and uh, with a hairy chest. It's funny. Well, ignore me. Keep going. You said specifically that if you were straight, you wouldn't marry me, and I'm just curious as to why, huh? Why, huh? All right. I'm not gonna talk to you when you're like this, okay? Okay, okay. You're right, you're right. I'm-- I'm just overreacting. But I really think it would be good for me to know, so so please, tell me. It's nothing. It's nothing to do with our relationship. It has more to do with the way you are with your boyfriends. Do you really want to discuss this in front of your mother? Please, I used to take her temperature in the tushy. Nothing shocks me. Just ignore me. Go, go, go, go, go. - How am I with my boyfriends? - Huh, you know how you are. Will, obviously, I don't. How am l? - Will? - Okay, you have a tendency-- You kind of need to be the star of your relationships. You know, it's all about your stuff. Your boyfriends are like gardeners, and you're sort of like No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do not call me a flower. I am not a flower. I am a gardener, damn it. I do plenty of hoeing. That's just what a mother likes to hear. Okay, okay. You know what? I think I am just-- I am done with this lovely lunch. I do not have to sit here and be criticized and insulted by my best friend. That is why my mother is in town. Grace, you asked me a question. You are describing the wrong person at this table. I am giving and nurturing and loving and selfless with my boyfriends. I, Will Truman, am no star. - ( timer ding ) - Oh. - Oh, that's 15 minutes. - Yeah. So uh, if the stick is blue, we're pregnant. Well, nothin' doin' on mine. - Karen? - Well, nothing here, either. Well, thank God for that. - Oh-- - You okay? Okay? Oh, honey, I'm relieved. I can't have a kid right now. We just recarpeted. Well, you know, I knew there'd be nothing on mine. I mean, I'm not insane. It's just-- Still, I'm a little sad. Oh, honey. Well, here, take my platinum. Charge yourself a little happy. No, thanks. I'll just hit the gym and work out some of these feelings and my delts. Uh, don't hate me for doing this, but-- I love you. Hello, Stan? Hi. Put your kids on, I want to talk to them. Eh-- yes, I'm serious! Grace's voice: "April 16, 1980: Dear Diary, Well, tonight was really my night. Adam and I won best couple at the Hawthorne Junior High Prom. Adam looked like Adam, but everyone said I looked like Debbie Harry, only prettier and with red hair. How psyched am l?" Ew. "June 5, 1995: Tonight was really my night. Danny got promoted to vice president of his investment firm. At the company dinner, everyone told him how lucky he is to have a girlfriend like me. I'm so proud of him. I love the dress that I wore. And my new shoes-- ooh-la-la." How did I get like this? Well, tonight was really my night. I was walking down Columbus, and these kids were shooting a commercial about I don't know what. It was juice or pants or something. Anyway, they put me in it. Your mother's gonna be on TV. They even gave me a line-- "It's chew-rrific." I'm guessing it wasn't pants. Look, Grace, I know that you've been sitting in here ever since lunch, scared to death about turning into me. No. I already know I'm you. What I'm scared of is what that means for my romantic life. I can't even get a gay guy to hypothetically marry me. Let me tell you something, dear. I joke about your father, but I love him. You can ask him any time, day or night, who is the love of his life, and he'll say, "I married her. Move over, you're blockin' the TV." Maybe you just got really lucky. No. No, I'm not lucky. I'm terrific. And you're terrific, Grace. Oh, honey, you are a wonderful woman. Grace, embrace who you are. I'm sorry, I must be in the wrong apartment. What's going on? What's the matter with you, Will? How could you not marry my daughter? Um, I'm gay? Well, that's not the point. Where else could you be lucky enough to find a girl like this? Because gardener, flower, star, co-star, call it whatever you want to, it works for us Adler girls. - Oh, oh-- okay, Mom. - Oh, dear. - Uh, in the hair. - I'm sorry, sorry. I'm sorry, darling. Oh, well, I'm late for my manicure. We'll meet for dinner at 8:00. Oh, that reminds me of a song. She gets too hungry for dinner at 8:00 ( thud )   
                




                    			Okay, let's do this quickly while Jack's still playing on the escalator. Okay, how about a juicer for Jack's birthday? That's a good idea. Then maybe he can give ours back. Here, try some. It's liquid sunshine. Mmm. It is liquid sunshine. How'd you do it? With the Schmenkman 5000, you can make juice out of anything. Oh, come on! I'm sure the Schmenkman 5000 is good, but can it really get juice out of anything? Ma'am, the Schmenkman 5000 is so good, you could get juice out of Hume Cronyn. Now, that's a good juicer. - Are we gonna get this or what? - I don't know. Hey, look. I'm Cher, circa 1978. My daughter's a what? Wait a minute. Why are you guys buying my birthday present in here? No, no-no. I don't need kitchen appliances. I eat all my meals at your house. Doy. Oh my God, and do not get me a juicer. I just sold the one I had. Um this birthday party we're throwing for you, - it's still a surprise, right? - Oh my God, totally. But I want to go over the guest list. And I want a celebrity-- no one lower than Joan Van Ark. How about Joan of Arc? What show was she on? Okay, anyways, let's goes next door and get some CD's. I want to get some surprise party music for my surprise party. I heard the new Alanis Morissette just got reduced. Yeah, that's what you get for thanking lndia. Are you looking for a juicer? Oh, l I really don't know. Well, this one is terrific. You know, they claim it can get juice out of-- Hume Cronyn, yeah. Hume Cronyn? He's a national treasure. That's not funny. See, the guy that just left, he was the one who-- I'm gonna need a few more minutes. Hi, I'm Mr. Juicer. My God, Grace Adler, you have gotten lonely. - Sam? - Hi, Grace. Oh my God, Sam? What are you doing here? Well, I woke up this morning and I realized that I have lived my entire life without one of these. - A juicer? - No, a kitchen. Grace Adler, wow. You know, the last time I saw you, you were this big. But I was on a hill and you were far away. - How are you? - Good. You know, I did the interior of a house that you were the contractor on in Sag Harbor. - Really? How'd you like my work? - Fantastic. I loved the way you put the floor down low where everybody walks. And-- and whose idea was it to put the ceiling - above everyone's head like that? - That was mine. Thank you. So how long are we not gonna talk about what we're not talking about? Oh, I can do this all day. I have a lot of staying power. You look great. So I guess I'll start. Will just left. Well, he always had good timing. Sam, he's right next door picking out CDs. Go catch him, before he buys "The Best Of Bread." Hey, you know, that's a great idea, except he hates me. Sam, he doesn't hate you any more than you hate him. Grace, I don't hate him. I love him. I miss him. Okay, he hates you a little more than you hate him. But one of you has to make the first move. It could be either one-- as long as it's you. You know, Grace, I can't. I gotta go meet an architect in about 10 minutes, but I'd love to talk to you about this. I'm staying at The Mercer. - Would you please call me? - Do you want me to tell Will anything? Tell him tell him his brother misses him. Where are the measuring spoons? - You know what? - Hmm? Maybe you want to put down your little sippy cup and help me make Jack's cake. Well, honey, all you had to do was ask. I'm happy to help. Rosario? Yeah Hi, honey. I'm gonna need you to make one of your seven-layer cakes for tomorrow. Mm-hm. And keep an eye on the kids. The fat one's gonna go right for the bowl. Yeah. Okay, hola. Baking is fun. - Hey. - Grace: Hi. What'd you end up getting Jack? I've narrowed it down to something spandex with padding. So we're gonna get him Richard Simmons? Oh my God. Do you know what he would love? Oh, what is that deal down in the Mediterranean, where you can charter a yacht with another couple for a week? You know, a seven-person crew. They take you up the ltalian Riviera. Oh, what is the name of that boat? Oh, I know. The SS Lower Your Dosage. What are you guys doing up here? We're making a cake from scratch, and I helped. - Hey, I've got some big news. - Yeah? Remember when you selfishly bailed on me at the store and left me to buy a birthday present for you to give your friend? Yeah, that was right after I thoughtfully split up the workload, so you could make your manicure on time. It was right about that time. Anyway, 30 seconds after you left Sam Truman walks up to me. Ooh, old lover? Sam Truman? My brother? So no? - Will, he really misses you. - Mmm, I'll bet. I'm gonna change, and go to the gym. - Maybe you should call him. - Hey, maybe I shouldn't. Will. Call your brother. You know, Michael Corleone forgave Fredo. Yeah, that was right before he had him taken out to the lake and shot. Yeah, but the important thing is he forgave him. No, I think the important thing to Fredo was that he got shot. Go back to your baking. Agh! This is so stupid. Five years ago, Will told Sam he hated the woman he was gonna marry, and as a result, Sam cut Will out of his life completely. And they were-- they were so close. And now, finally-- - finally Sam seems ready-- - Honey, honey I barely care about Will. Can you imagine how I feel about the brother? Damn it, honey. I was hoping there'd be at least one straight guy here tonight in case these puppies accidentally fall out. Whoops! Woo! - Party's goin' pretty well, huh? - Yeah. I love surprises. You love surprises too, don't ya? Surprisingly, no. Really? I love them. It's like these little mini-quiches. They look like they'll be bland, and then-- Surprise, jalapeño. Now, that's surprising. - Here, put these on the table. - All right. ( knocking on door ) Will? Door, prontito. Let's see, we got the cop, the cowboy, the lndian. This has gotta be the construction worker. - Sam? - Will? Grace? Surprise. Are you gonna hide in here all night? I'm not hiding. Thought Jack's party would be a good time to weed out my tie collection. Will? Pick the one you want to be strangled with. Hugo Boss is kinda nice. Grace? Will, I had to do something. You guys are gentiles. This could go on for 40 years. Will, he's here. He obviously wants to make up. Just go out there and settle it. Gee, Grace, you're right. Maybe after, we can swing by the Middle East and clear up that whole mess with a big group hug. Well, even they called a truce every so often. You know, to hide the nerve gas. Will, every family has problems you have to work through. I mean, don't you think the Kennedys had words when Maria married the Terminator? I don't really think they care who the girls marry. Will, you were so close. I bet you can't even remember how it all started. Five years ago, June 24th, mid-afternoon, he asked me what I honestly thought of his girlfriend. I said, "She's morose and controlling and icy." He said, "Too bad, I'm marrying her." I said, "I don't think that's a very good idea." He was wearing a blue shirt. I was wearing the jeans-- All right, so you have a vague recollection. But Will, he's here. - You owe it to him. - I owe it-- He is the one that cut me out of his life. He's the one that leaves the family Christmas at 3:00 when he knows I'm showing up at 4:00. I have a nephew that I have never met. Do you know what that feels like? Well, I got Jack his celebrity. Leslie Uggams just arrived. Grace, I don't want to see Sam. I don't want to talk to Sam. Okay, Leslie Uggams just left. - So you'll stay here all night? - Yup. - You won't give him a chance? - Nope. Even if this is the last time this opportunity presents itself?. Yup. Wow. You know what my Aunt Pesha would say if she were in this room right now? "Why the hell did my parents name me Pesha?" No. She would say-- What was she, a Yiddish mime? - You didn't say anything! - Oh, I said plenty. I just gave you the Eye of Shame. - Oh, Grace. The-- - Hey-hey-hey! Don't push Pesha! Talk to the eye. I think he's softening. He just needs a little more time. You can hang out for like - a year, right? - Hmm. He got Mom's stubbornness. And I got Dad's stubbornness. You know, if you were a functional family-- We'd be on display at Ripley's Believe It Or Not. The three of you-- you, Will and Ginny, would sit down in a room and just-- and just hash it out. I don't think that's gonna happen. Ginny and I are getting a divorce. That's fantastic! Oh, no. I mean, that's awful. I'm sorry. It's just that's your way in with Will. You've gotta tell him. - ( glass clinking ) - Could I have everybody's attention? I thought it would be fun if people came up and made a toast to the man of the hour. So, who wants to say a few words about Jack? Come on, queens are better to open. Oh, all right. I'll start. Uh, hmm. Oh, okay. Say it's 12:45 and one of your real girlfriends cancels for lunch. Well, there is nobody-- and I do mean nobody-- who can fill in like Jack. Honey, if catty were a perfume, you'd reek of it. I love ya, honey. I do. I love ya. Okay, who's next? I'll be next. Jack, I joke with you a lot, I call you names-- names like Nelly, Mary, Tinkerbell. Fembot, Ally McHomo. Get to the good stuff or get off the stage. Well, I love you, Jack. I don't tell you that enough. You're like-- truth be told, you're like the brother I never had. And what do you know, the brother I never had is here tonight! But see, unlike him, you'd never cut me out of your life or split up my family. So here's to you, Jack. Happy birthday. What the hell kind of a toast was that? Will? Will? Look, Ginny and I are getting a divorce. That's too bad, Sam. You guys deserved each other. That's it. I'm outta here. - I tried. - Sam, where are you going? - I'm leaving. - Why? Why? Didn't you hear what he just said? Oh, oh. No, that was just his way of reaching out. Yeah. Well, this is my way of staying. Bye. No, Sam. Come on, come on. It took you five years to get here, and you're only 15 feet apart. That's like three feet a year. Merchant lvory films move faster than that. He obviously doesn't want to talk to me. No, you're wrong. In his bedroom, he said more than anything else, he wants to resolve this. He actually said that? 'Cause "resolve" and "revolver" sound a lot alike. I'm pretty sure he said resolve. Please, Sam. - Please try. - I don't know, Grace. Okay. Who could say no to the Eye of Shame? Thank you! ( "A Man and A Woman" theme plays) That's it. Can you feel that? Hi, lovers. I love you all like lovers. Really. I love you and you and you and-- You, I don't know, but I could definitely see loving you. Rrrrow! But most of all, I love love. I do. Sometimes I love love so much, I wish I could take it to Vegas for a really naughty weekend. Thank you, thank you. But what makes today particularly special for me is Will: I don't care who you're divorcing, it doesn't change the fact that you cut me off! Sam: Well, I'm here now! At least I'm making an effort! Okay, eyes back to me, okay? - 29 years ago, I was - Sam: You called her a cold-hearted bitch! Will: What was I supposed to do, lie?! Pay no attention to the brats behind the curtain! So today, I turn 29, which is so unlike me. Will: Oh, that's a load of crap and you know it! - Sam: How long are you - It kinda makes you think, doesn't it? What have I done with my life? Where have I been? Where do I want to go? Well, I have all the answers, and I have written them down in the form of a poem. Shut up! "'Twas a starlit night in '69, When a boy named Jack arrived divine. So, nibble your cheese and sip your wine, For today dear Jack turns 29." - Honey, if you were born in '69 - "'Twas" you're 30. No, I'm-- Okay, good. I think we're making progress. We've moved way past the Ginny incident into some very old issues. We've heard about Will getting the better bike Sam getting the bigger room both of you liking Susie Borgeson-- and I think we all agree that one's moot. So now, I'm going to take a break, because my throat's a little dry and I'm gonna let you guys take it from here. No fighting. No biting. Just talk. Relate. Ay, goyim. ( phone rings ) Hello? Whoa-whoa-whoa, Jack. Jack, slow down I know. I know it's hard, but you are. You-- Buddy, trust me, you're 30. Hey, cut off your arm and count the rings. You're 30. All right, I'm on my way over. - Is he okay? - Oh, he's talking crazy. Using words like "irritable bowel" and "steady job." I better get over there. Ahem. Will? Sam, it was-- - it was good to see you. - Yeah, it was. Make a plan. So, Will, maybe we'll see each other while I'm in town. Yeah. - I'll call your hotel. - Yeah, good. Hey, you okay? Yeah. I know I threatened to strangle you with a tie, but uh I'm glad you made this happen. I aim to meddle. Oh my God. This place is a mess. Maybe we should just move. I like what you've got goin' on, sort of early American frat house. - Want some help? - Uh, no. It's okay. Well, I'm gonna go. I'm really glad you made this happen. Thanks. Me, too. It's really good seeing you again, Sam. Good to see you too, Grace.   
                




                    			Will? Ei. Eu pensei que você fosse arrumar isso aqui. Eu tinha que lavar o rosto e não queria lavar com as mãos sujas. -Você não estava na casa do Jack? -Eu estava. Ele está na maior neurose por fazer 30 anos. No melhor estilo Greta Garbo. Ele fica com uma mão na cabeça e uma camisola cheia de plumas molhada de lágrimas. Por que você voltou? Ele queria que eu pegasse o presente de aniversário dele. Ah, está aqui. lsso vai animá-lo. Com uma coisa interessante na ponta, ele vai pular um metro. ''Pule, Jack. Pule.'' -Desculpe, você estava dormindo? -Estava. Você está vermelha. É que eu estava sonhando. -Um sonho erótico. -Não. Aliás, era bem surrealista. Eu estava num navio pesqueiro e eu Sabe, virei uma galinha. Eu vou voltar para a casa do Jack e venho para cá bem tarde. -Está bem. -Está bem. Tem alguma coisa errada em eu me sentir bem com isso? BRlGA EM FAMÍLlA SEGUNDA PARTE -Oi -Oi. Quem é que adora você A Grace Adler. Pois ela parou na padaria do Mendel e comprou três coisas para você com no nome. E um light para mim. Meu favorito: Bolinho de catarro. Deixe na cozinha para mim, obrigado. -Will, eu preciso falar com você. -Espere aí. Eu estou conversando com o dentista. Ele quer saber com que artista eu pareço. Quem é o ''Advogado Gostoso''? Já existe um ''Advogado Gostoso''. Queria falar alguma coisa? Sim. Sim. Sim, eu quero. Tá legal, muito bem Sabe quando, às vezes, você faz algo e se mete num enrosco e você sabe que é roubada mas você não percebe até que ponto vai essa roubada, até chegar no fim? Claro, foi assim que ''Footloose: O Musical'' foi feito. -Você fez sexo. -Não. Não? Eu estou sentindo. Não, não. Deve ser só porque -eu fiz sexo. -Sua taradinha. É! Mas quando? Não, não fale. Eu quero adivinhar. Ontem, fizemos a festa Só tinha gay, exceto o meu irmão. -Meu Deus. -Will. Meu Deus. Meu Deus! Não foi na festa. Já sei, foi o cara da quitanda do Balducci. -Como é? Não. -Não adianta mentir para mim porque eu vi a paquera com ele. ''Por favor, moço, essas frutas estão frescas?'' Grace, sua malandrinha. -Não foi com o cara da quitanda. -Não foi? Não. Foi Meu Deus, recebi um e-mail. Ele citou Nietzsche. Será que ele é pretensioso ou só profundo e inteligente? Já sei. Vou mandar uma frase da autobiografia de Joan Lunden e ver se espanto o cara. Então? Com quem foi? Foi com Ele mordeu a isca. Nossa, ele quer me conhecer. Será que eu topo? Quero dizer, ele é dentista. Vai nessa, talvez ele seja gostoso. -Desculpe, você estava no meio -Não, não, não. Não tem erro. -Depois, a gente conversa. -Mas eu estou a fim de saber. -É que eu estou concentrado aqui -Não. Tá limpo. Conversamos depois. Eu vou até a quitanda do Balducci. Quer que eu traga alguma coisa? O vendedor. Ah, esse você já pegou. O Jacobs precisou cancelar hoje e eu remarquei para amanhã à tarde. Você pode ligar e marcar um horário só para saber se ele não O que foi? Você transou. O quê? Como você Será que está tão na cara assim? Eu não entendo. -Como todo mundo percebe? -Todo jogador de pôquer é contador. E por falar nisso, com quem foi, hem? Não foi com ninguém que você conheça. -Foi com o Sam. -Meu Deus. Eu vou embora antes que você descubra todos os detalhes -do que rolou ontem à noite. -Meu bem, pare com isso. Seria impossível descobrir todos os detalhes. -Só sei que foram duas. -Ah, meu Deus! Certo. Vou tomar um café. Pode me trazer uma rosquinha bem gostosa. Nenhuma palavra. Nenhuma palavra para ninguém. Certo, querida, como quiser. -Não direi nada para ninguém. Eu -Jure. Jure pela sua mãe Pelos seus enteados Pelas suas jóias. Está bem, eu juro. Bom dia, coisa linda. Meu Deus. Eu estou com 30 anos. Sabe o que é isso em anos gays? Eu estou acabado, derrotado, virei uma tiazona. E esse gorro, querido? O cabelinho está rebelde hoje? Karen, eu estou de luto pela minha vida. Eu entendo, fofo. E se eu não tivesse passado o meu creme anti-rugas você perceberia a minha expressão de pena. Eu estou com 30 anos e não fiz nada de bom na vida. Nada que preste. Não fiz nada. Eu nunca vou ser feliz na minha vida de novo. Meu bem, eu tenho uma fofoquinha. Mas que droga! Eu não posso contar. Karen, é a minha felicidade que está em jogo. Se aconteceu alguma tragédia ou alguma sacanagem eu quero saber! Fofo, eu não posso contar. Prometi que eu não ia falar nada. Filha, faça algo para quebrar a promessa. Faça mímica, sei lá. Meu bem, eu já sei, eu já sei É o juramento das escoteiras? Não, é para você adivinhar. -Certo. Certo. -Não posso trair a confiança dela. -Três palavras. -Vamos lá. A primeira palavra se parece Cabeça, olhos, nariz, rosto Rosto! Parece rosto. Rosto, chosto, nosto, costo, osto Querido, essas palavras não existem. -Está bem, vamos lá. -Rosto, encosto. Ah, Meu Deus. Espere. Espere. A Grace. Certo, segunda palavra. lsso. Espere Tudo bem, entendi. Tá legal. E com quem a Grace -Está bem. -Terceira palavra. Espere, como é que eu faço? -Está bem, está bem. Sam. -Sam? Meu Deus! A Grace transou com o Sam? Sou jovem de novo! Sou jovem de novo! Sou jovem de novo! E você está saindo com alguém ou vai esperar o divórcio sair? Na verdade, eu saí. Eu estou saindo. Que legal. Fale sobre ela. O que essa pessoa faz? Como ela é? Ela tem coxas musculosas, ombros largos quer dizer, você gosta dessas coisas ou sou só eu? Só você. -Sam, oi. -Oi, Grace. Que bom que você voltou. Eu quero a sua opinião. Eu vou tomar um café com o dentista cibernético daqui a uma hora. Será que isso é loucura? Será que é uma má idéia? Eu jamais julgaria o que você faz com a sua vida amorosa. Não importa quem seja. Saia com quem quiser. Transe com quem quiser. Só quero que seja feliz. Obrigado. Bom, agora, crianças, eu vou pedir licença para vocês. Eu vou cuidar dos meus dentinhos. -Você não ia contar para ele? -Eu tentei, não deu. Conte você. Grace, você não me contou quem era o cara. -Depois eu conto. -Está bem. Tomara que role alguma coisa comigo para eu alcançar vocês. Você saiu com alguém e o Sam também saiu. Eu não acredito nisso. Will, você está espumando pela boca. Como você teve coragem? Em geral, ou nessa situação, em particular? Sem piada. -Will, eu sinto muito. -Foi um acidente. Um acidente? E como foi isso? Desculpe, eu escorreguei e caí várias, várias e várias vezes. -Sei que é meio esquisito. -lsso não é esquisito, Grace. Gays republicanos são esquisitos. -lsso é loucura! -Will, por favor. Nós podemos lsso é bem coisa sua, Sam. Você aparece na minha vida e vai se servindo de tudo. -Nada mudou. -Talvez não devêssemos contar. Você queria o maior quarto e ficou para você. Queria o carro do papai e ficou para você também. E agora, a Grace. Só tem uma coisa, amigo. Não pode ficar com ela porque ela é minha. -Com licença. -Foi só uma noite. -Sério? Foi só uma noite. -Está bem, foram duas vezes, mas Pare! O que você quer que eu diga? Que não vai entrar no meu quarto e pegar os meus brinquedos. Seus brinquedos? Eu sou um brinquedo? Então, Will, me diga: Onde vão as pilhas? Não, você está nervoso. Não responda. Will, Will. Eu já pedi desculpas. Não precisa bancar o possessivo e dominador, está bem? Eu não sou possessivo nem dominador. É o que o Sam não pode ficar com você porque você é minha. Como eu sou boba! Vivi esse tempo todo iludida achando que eu era a dona do meu nariz. Você está exagerando. É? E você me traiu. E o fato de você não entender o meu lado só piora as coisas. Até que não foi tão ruim. Pode uma coisa dessas? ''Ela é minha.'' Sou propriedade dele. Por acaso, ele virou algum Sultão das Arábias? Meu bem, o que aconteceu com o seu cabelo? Parece que o Tico e o Teco andaram por aí. Quem é você para falar, Mulan? Bom, muito bem, Grace. Se quer mesmo saber, eu acho Eu acho que a questão aqui é outra. Está bem, está bem, talvez o momento tenha sido errado, mas talvez Como eu posso dizer isso? Eu acho que transou com o Sam porque ele é um Will que mexe nos seus peitinhos. Como é? O quê? Mas Acha que transei com o Sam porque ele é uma versão hetero do Will? Que coisa ridícula. Karen, Karen, eu transei com o Sam -porque ele é bonito -O Will também. -inteligente. -O Will também. -engraçado. -Você acha que o Will é. Chega. O lance não teve nada a ver com o Will. Meu bem, eu não estou julgando-a. Afinal de contas qual a mulher que não gosta que mexam nos seus peitinhos? Pare de falar peitinhos. Está bem? Está bem? Olhe, você está redondamente enganada. Você ficou louca, você tem uma vida muito estranha. Eu não sei nem quem é você. Peitinhos. WlLL TRUMAN, ADVOGADO Ei, eu não quero patas sujas nem surpresas no meu tapete. Klaus Von Puppy é limpinho e educado. Não estava me referindo ao cachorro. Já entendi, está trabalhando no caso mais dif´icil, ''Will vs. Vida''. -Está sabendo? -É, eu estou. Desembuche, bonita. Eu tenho olhos para ver ouvidos para ouvir e uma cabeça para concordar com sabedoria. Pode falar, você está no ar. O que me deixa louco é que ele pensa que pode chegar na minha vida e se servir à vontade. E o pior é que quer que eu ainda fique contente, mas eu não fiquei. -Mas é claro que não, ela é sua. -Obrigado. Eu já terminei um montão de relacionamentos porque a pessoa não conseguia perceber que ela era minha. É. O quê? Não. Olhe, o meu lance com a Grace é bem diferente do seus casinhos passageiros. Não, não é. É a mesma coisa. A Grace é sua. Assim como você é meu, não é, Klaus bebê? Eu decido quando ele come, quando ele sai quem ele cheira e quando ele corta as unhas, como você e a Grace. Não, não foi isso que eu quis dizer. Eu sei que a Grace não é minha. E ela pode cheirar quem ela Vá embora, Jack. Está bem, mas quer saber de uma coisa? Vou dizer só uma coisinha. Eu acho que está nervoso assim porque está com inveja do Sam. O quê? Está na cara. Você gostaria de dormir com ela. Que piração. Piração mesmo, Will. O que é isso? Admita. No fundo, você queria ter a Grace desse jeito. Abraçar, dar uns beijos, sentir o perfume dela escorregar as mãos por trás Desculpe, apague o que eu falei. Ellen, querida, pode trazer um sal de frutas, por favor? Não sei como os heteros fazem com os negócios aqui e aqui. Eu também não sei, Jack. Mas um dia eu lhe ensino como se chama isso. Bom, para finalizar, você está com ciÚmes. Não da parte nojenta do sexo, mas do fato do seu irmão conhecer um lado da Grace que você nunca conhecerá. Eu não estou certo? -Está vendo o quê? -Uns exercícios. Sei lá, estão pulando pra caramba. Acho que esse deve ser o ''Canal do Pulo''. Por quê? O controle está ali e eu estou aqui. -Sou seu brinquedo. -Eu sei, eu sei, eu sei Desculpe-me. Eu não quero fazer tempestade num copo d'água. Precisamos rir e chorar para chegarmos num acordo? Não, podemos encurtar isso. -Você está bem? -Estou. E você pode sair com quem você quiser. Mesmo que seja alguém da minha árvore genealógica. Eu vou trocar de roupa porque eu estou fedido e depois, eu vou sentar no sofá com você e ver Lifetime. -Vai passar o filme da Michele Lee. -Que filme é esse? ''Não Vou Viajar Sem Minha Filha Porque Tenho Um Tumor Cerebral, Mas Não Ache Ruim Você É Um Bêbado.'' Beleza. -Oi. -Oi. Eu estava no Village e pensei ''Se eu tomar dois metrôs, um ônibus e andar mais seis quadras, vou estar perto da casa dela.'' -Tudo bem? -Sim. Tudo bem. Está a fim de sair? Acho que não. Hoje ou nunca, certo? É uma situação esquisita. Parece que eu estou violando um dos mandamentos. Não cobiçarás o irmão sumido do seu melhor amigo gay que apareceu de novo. Não conheço esse mandamento. Eu só li até o décimo. Bom, então, eu vou indo. Tomara que o Will saiba a sorte que ele tem por ter você. Ele sabe. Ligue para o seu irmão. Escute, sabe o que o Jack falou? Falou que eu estava com ciÚmes do Sam porque ele podia transar com você e eu não. A Karen falou que eu transei com o Sam porque ele é uma versão heterossexual de você. Será que temos que conversar sobre isso? Vamos encurtar a conversa? Grace, quer transar comigo? Não vai dar. Não transo com gays. Esse é o problema. Eu transo.   
                




                    			Oh. that's okay. I'll just wait for the next one. Oh-- Or not. I was going down. but I don't have to go straight down. We're all so goal-oriented.

Karen you have to do something about him. Eventually. you know. he's gonna kill someone. ( chuckles ) You understand that would be wrong. don't you? Yeah. I guess. Fire him. Grace. he is old and sweet and helpless. I can't just fire him because he's a raging incompetent. I mean. maybe you could. but not me. Karen. if that were true. we wouldn't be having this conversation. You know. I guess I should just cut him loose. - ( phone ringing ) - I mean. as Gandhi once said. "You're only as strong as your weakest servant." ( ringing ) - I think he said that. - ( ringing ) Or maybe it was. "Wow. this sand is hot!" - ( ringing ) - Oh Honey. are you gonna get that?

Wow. I can't believe you just moved in. The place already looks great. Ooh. really great. Really. really great. Thanks. but. it is only the living room. Trust me. you don't want to see the bedroom. - Maybe later. - Maybe later. Go on. go on. sit down. I am so glad you two could make it. You're officially my closest friends in New York. Oh-- Except for the guy who peed on my car this morning. Ah. he's more like family. I know what you mean. My uncle does the same thing. That's a lie. - To new friends. - New friends. You know. you have the most beautiful smile. It's-- it's a little crooked. - Now. so was Audrey Hepburn's. - Oh. come on now. I hate my smile. Well. then stop smiling. You know. I thought we'd start off with some veggies. or at uh. 4.99 a pound. "crudites." Great. Well. you know the old saying. "Crudites. gone tomorrow." ( snorts ) Yeah. that's hot. I-- I love Iove. Iove.

I hope you like veal marsala. I slaved for hours over the takeout menu. Wow. You smell great. Thank you. What are you wearing? Just me. That's a lie. I'll be right back. Well - I think it's pretty clear. - You're right. - Go home. - Go home. - You go home! - You go home! Peter is not gay. Oh. please. You think everybody is straight. He's gay. so you can just stop flirting. Oh. wrongo. Marilu. He's straight. So-- so you can stop posing with that fake interested look. "Ah. yes. Mombasa." Oh-- oh-- oh. hello? "I hate my smile." What about your charming fake laugh? Oh-- oh-- oh-- oh! That doesn't compare to your fake laugh. with the-- Oh. that's a good one. Grace. That's good. Oh my God. This is so stupid. I didn't come here to compete with you. Well. neither did l. Can't we just sit here and behave like normal human being people? - Deal. - Deal. Okay. I hope this is all right. One question. is veal supposed to have a beak? Believe me. Driver. this has been harder for me than it has for you. Mrs. Walker. am I fired because I'm-- I'm a bad driver? No. no. You're very good at what you do. I just think it's time for a change. I mean. I know that you want-- Honey. I'm over here now. I remember that you always wanted to do other things in your life. Why. I recall you having an interest in woodworking. - That was Cook. - Oh. that's right. I'm sorry. You loved the clarinet. That was Maid. Honey. you're gonna have a lot of free time on your hands now. Find a hobby. We've had some good times. Mrs. Walker. - haven't we? - Oh. it has been fun. Why. I remember the time that-- Why. I remember the time that Stan and I were in the car. and we blew a fan belt. and you had to push the car all the way to New Jersey. Almost lost a toe to frostbite. Those were the good times. Oh. and how about when we used to take our little country drives and play our favorite game-- "Spook The Horse"? Oh. they do hate the sound of that horn. don't they? Well. I'm gonna miss you. Driver. but I'm sure you'll land on your feet-- unlike those people you hit. Will. come on. He's perfect for me. Except for one little problem. He's perfect for me. I need this more than you. Oh. please! You've had plenty of dips in the love pool. I'm still in the cabana. trying out floaties. Okay. - Gimme the phone. - Get-- No! No. no. no. no. no! - Agh! - Give it to me! Put it in my hand! You can have it when I'm done! Ow! You're hurting me with it! You're gonna break it! Will. I told you. you live with a hetero long enough. you're going to catch it. Fine. You want him so bad. you can have him-- even though he's gay! He is not gay. What's this? A question of sexual orientation? The doctor is in. - Oh. Jack-- - No. no. Jack has the most finely tuned gaydar in the tri-state area. Do-do-do-do-do Ding! He can name a gay guy in one note. Ah. yes. many have sought my counsel on this subject. They say. "Jack is a wise man. Jack is a dangerous man. Jack is a gr-r-r-r-eat man." No. Jack is just a man. A man who knows men who like men. Bring to me the facts. Okay. In his bathroom. he had three magazines. and one of them was "Martha Stewart's Living." He also had "Basketball Digest." Ah. you both make compelling points. but I believe the truth is to be found in the third magazine. - "Vanity Fair." - Unless it's "Vanity Fair." You're right. Will. He is good. Now. there is one question you can ask that will reveal the truth. I hesitate to share this secret with you. for it has awesome power. What would that question be? Are you gay? Thank you Homo Won Kenobi. ( knocking on door ) Who is it? Peter: Oh. hey. guys. It's me. Wha-- wha-- wha-- hey-hey-hey! How about bringin' the desperation level down about three clicks. huh? Not attractive. Open the door. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. Want to go to a movie? - Movie. that's a good idea. - Oh. yeah. - Why don't you come in? - Oh. thanks. We really want you to meet a friend of ours. Um. this is Jack. Hi. Nice to meet you. Hello. I know. So uh. there's a couple of movies I was into checkin' out. Hey.

Grace wants to know if you like boys or girls. Will! Eh. do I like boys or girls? Well. isn't it obvious?! - Yes. I've been trying to-- - Yes. - No. we're having trouble. - I have no idea. I gotta tell you. This has never happened to me before. Look. we're-- We're just trying to figure out which one of us you're dating. Dating? Who said anything about dating? I thought we were friends. Well. it started out as friends. but you sniffed me. Yeah. and-- and then you let me hold your club. Oh. my. - Where you-- where you-- - Where you going? You know.

                    			Grace. we're going to a cabin in the woods. I'm almost certain you're not going to need a sequined purse. Okay. Do you need it? Grace. with this outfit? No-- So tell me again. Why are we doing this? I told you. I need to see winter. Come on. we'll build a snowman. do funny things with the carrot. Well ( Cockney accent ) I do like me vegetables. But. I mean. a whole weekend with Jack and Karen-- Oh. come on. That's the incentive. Just think about it. Karen. doing anything in nature? And Jack chopping wood? Hmm. To the cabin we will go And ski upon the snow We'll see a lot of bears Forgettin' all our cares. Yeah-- Ladies and gentlemen. give it up for Puff Mommy. Okay. okay. Iisten. As far as Will knows. this is just a fun. impulsive getaway for the weekend. so please. no mention of Michael or the fact that tomorrow would have been their anniversary. This is to take his mind off that. Oh. Iook. mittens and a muff. Is this on? Ooh. can I have this. It'll bring out the chestnut in my eyes. No. No. that's Will's. and that's the last thing he'd want to see. Michael gave that to him for his birthday. Hi. I'm Scarfy. I'm the gift you give your boyfriend before you dump him. I cost $12. Hey! Sensitivo! - What did I just say to you? - I heard you. You know. no one took me on vacation when I broke up with what's-his-face. uh bleached hair. tattoo. goatee. Who am I talking about? God. I don't know. honey. You just described a needle in a gaystack. All right. everybody. come on in. Girls are downstairs. boys are up. Hey. people! Careful with my luggage. Grace? Honey. six inches from the walls. I can tell you're a basher. ( thuds ) All right. here you go. For your troubles. Karen. you're tipping us? We're not gonna take your money. Will Mum be needing towels this evening? - Isn't this fantastic? - Yeah. Oh God. Iook at it. There's like no one around. My God. what if we got trapped up here? Who'd we eat first? Well. Karen's out. 'cause there's nothing natural or digestible on her body. - And I mean that as a compliment. - And I took that way. honey. Well. I'm out. 'cause I'm too petite. A good soup is all you're gonna get from me. It'd have to be someone with enough meat slash fat on him. Oh. Will. Try not to move around too much. It'll keep you tender. Wait a minute. How come no one wants to eat me? All: Too chewy. Karen. did you see this? It's a note from the caretaker. Cook's dead. - Who's Cook? - Our cook. Your cook's name is Cook? No. Grace. he has a name. I just don't remember it. Well. wait a minute. it'll come to me. it'll come to me. "Where are my damn eggs Paul?" Paul. God. Paul is dead. Now who the hell is gonna cook for us?! I guess this concludes the mourning period. Wait. Maybe the passing of Cook was a blessing in disguise. I'm gonna cook. Men. go hunt wild game. There's a White Hen Pantry two miles down the hill. Karen. the gays don't catch. Allow me to go hunt and gather for the womenfolk. Jack. don't you think it would be nice if you went with Will. so that he didn't have to be alone? Okay. Very well. I'll hunt and gather with our womenfolk. Thanks again. Karen. for letting us use your cabin. This is gonna be so great for Will. Aw. no problem. honey. Stan had to take his kids to Scarsdale to see their real mother. What was her name? Wait a minute. It'll come to me. "Stan. take the kids to see that bitch Cathy!" Cathy. Hey. Mrs. Walker. Campbell. is that you? Little Campbell? My. my. Iook how you've grown. We saw each other three months ago. Oh. well. I guess everything just looks bigger in the woods. - Campbell? - Oh my God. Grace Adler? Oh my God. You two know each other? - High school! - We went to see "Loverboy" together. Oh my God! That's right. we did. So you were both geeks in high school. Campbell. what are you doing here? Little of everything. I take care of cabins. In the winter. I ski. The summer. I bike. Yeah. The outdoors agrees with you. Works for you. Does a lot for you. And stale air and concrete does a lot for you. You look good. You look really good. I can't believe you're here. Honey. Campbell brought the wood in. Looks like he'll be leaving with it. too. I should go finish my rounds. But do you want to get together later. grab a beer? Oh. yeah. I'd love to. Oh. um. I-- I can't. I came up with friends. and we have um stuff. Okay. Well. if you change your mind. I'm working till midnight at Ed's Beachcomber. It's a local pub. Okay. It was really good seeing you. - All right. uh. take care. - Okay. Midnight. Why can't I order that from the L.L. Bean catalogue? Woman. are you insane?! - Go fetch it! - Oh-- No. this weekend is about Will. We're all here for him. Oh. I cannot believe you. We are trapped alone in the wilderness with Wayland and Madam. and you just let Babe the Blue Ox walk out that door? Now. you think about that. Jack. that's not a word. Uh. yeah. it is. Use it in a sentence. Every morning. I "spramp" my face with cold water. "Spramp" your face? What the hell is that? Yes. spramp. Spramp! The bubbles from the Jacuzzi spramp up. Note how the sea spramps off the jagged rocks. Just because you do this. doesn't make it a word. I don't know. Will. Before I get into bed. I like to spramp on a little gardenia for Stan. No. you don't! You do not spramp. because no one has ever spramped anything in the history of language. Jeez. what a karpooch. Tell me about it. Okay. Jack. Iet it go. Sorry. I forgot this is "Will's" weekend. Ow. - What was that? - Um. of fun. Will's weekend of fun. Are you having fun? - Yeah. - Good! - Woo! - Excellent. perfect. great. "'Overacted' said the New York Times." "'Cheap and transparent.' said the Boston Globe." Look. this wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that this would have been Michael's and my anniversary? - No! No. absolutely not. - Come on. that's ridiculous. Come on. get over yourself. - Okay. I guess so - All right. yeah. I guess in a way it is. Guys. that's really very sweet. but it's not a big deal. Look. Will. we knew that this was gonna be a difficult weekend for you. and we just thought this would take your mind off of it. - ( timer dings ) - Oh. there's my roast. Guys. thank you. It's not that I don't appreciate your little pity party. but. really. take my word for it. I'm okay about Michael. She's such a brave little toaster. Okay. here it is. Mmm. Mmm. mmm. - What is it? - Beef tenderloin. I don't think it's dead yet. It just looks mad and really hot. Karen. it looks great. And it smells-- It smells. Um. Will. what-- what does it smell like? It smells like-- - "Pizza. pizza." - I'll make the call. - I'll clear the table. - I'll bury this. Karen: Hey. wait a minute Well. I'm bored. I'm gonna go take my disco nap. You know. even though you lied to me and deceived me and Karen's here. I'm still having a good time. - Thanks. - Sure. And if there's anything else I can do for you-- Now that you mention it. there is one thing. You can finish drying. - I'm going upstairs. - Are you sure? 'Cause if you want. we can make s'mores. S'mores? Miss Adler. of all the counselors here at Camp Walker. you're my favorite. God. I thought he was never gonna leave. It's 11 :30. Come on. get it in gear. - What are you talking about? - Honey. it's almost midnight. Time for Cinderella to turn into a frisky little minx. huh? Huh? ( Karen laughs ) Ooh-- When did you turn into a poker? Grace. it's 11 :30. Campbell gets off work in half an hour. Don't you want to find out if he's mm-mm good!? What about Will? Oh. what about him? Come on. Grace. I mean. Iook. Iook out there. Those squirrels are gettin' more action than you are. I don't know. Me reuniting with an old boyfriend when Will is trying to forget about his? It just doesn't seem-- Damn. Iook at those squirrels go. All right. Grace. You're right. you're right. Forget about Campbell. Who needs him? Who needs his strong. sinewy arms and his washboard abs? His fierce. dark. penetrating eyes looking at you as he backs you up against the sink. grabs you by the hair. turns you roughly-- not too roughly. but. hell. what's too roughly? - Hey. you're fogging up the windows. - Yeah. - Why don't you go to bed? - Mmm. Jack: Okay. this is the money hand. Showcase showdown. Yup. whoever loses this hand is gonna be showin' the goodie package. Honey. wh-- why are we doing this? Well. it's strip poker. We just keep playing till we're both naked. And then Well. we could ( thud ) ( gasps ) Did you hear that? - Yes. - Oh my God. Honey. well-- Oh my God. do you see that? What is that? It looks like a big red matted rodent or something. Well. I can't quite-- Oh. there it is! What the hell is that?! I don't know. but it's moving around back! I'll get the flashlight. I-- I don't think I've ever seen that color in nature before. Oh my God! ls it a yeti? No. it's a single white female with a terra-cotta rinse. What are you doing? You scared the crap out of me! Well. I'm sorry. We thought you were Big Foot's cousin. Big Hair. So where were ya? Did you go out with Loverboy? Yes. And keep your mouths shut about it. if that's possible. Well. color you moody. What's the problem? What's the problem? You want to know what the problem is? There's a man out there who wants me. and I'm not with him because there's a man upstairs who needs me. I'm spramped if I do. I'm spramped if I don't. Okay. first of all. that's the incorrect use of that word. Second of all. so. cut to the chase. I'm I gonna be an uncle or not? No. we just kissed. Okay. then a little over-the-sweater action. but that's it. Grace. I got further with Jack tonight. I haven't felt this good in a long time. and it's all your fault. Karen. Hey. I have feelings too. you know? Damn it. I was trying to keep a straight face. I'm going to bed. And by the way. it looks like Dr. Zhivago threw up on you. She needs help. Listen. we gotta clear out of here tomorrow night so that Grace can be with Campbell. Uh. there's a gay bar exactly 5.3 miles north-northwest of here. Gaydar? - Cop at the toll booth. - Oh-- Are you sure this is a gay bar? At first I was afraid I was petrified Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side Here. Iet me buy you a drink. Thank you. Jack. That's nice of you to offer. - 20 enough? - Yeah. that'll get us started. - What's your pleasure? - Mmm Both: George Stephanopoulos. Mmm. Okay. before we go any further. I just have to say that I do not want this getting around school. I'm running for class treasurer. and if you blab. I'm only gonna get the football vote. - Can I tell Billy Wilcox? - Hmm I thought you were Billy Wilcox. Oh. well. Will: Grace. open up. I don't have a key. - Oh my God. it's Will. - Your boyfriend? No. worse. My gay roommate. You've gotta hide. Here. on the porch. Gracie-- - Hi. - Hi. What are you doin' home? Are you okay? I'm fine. I just-- Why be in an empty bar when I can be hangin' out with you? You look flushed. Gracie. Are you sick? Oh. Oh. yeah. Yeah. I-- I think I'm contagious. You should stay away from me. Goodnight. Yeah. you're in a weird mood. You didn't eat any of Karen's cooking. did you? 'Cause I thought I threw that whole thing in the lake. ( knocking on door ) Oh my God. it's back. and this time it's personal. Don't answer that. It's-- it's probably just the-- the-- the wind blowing a pine cone against the door three times in rapid succession. What are you talkin' about. crazy? It's probably just Jack. You know what? Screw him. No. thank you. Jack. did you-- Hi. What do you know. it's winter out there. Uh. did I interrupt something? Yeah. and I think I should be going. I'm sorry. Campbell. Am I moving? I can't feel my legs. Uh. Grace? What's with the mansicle? I am so sorry. We ran into each other yesterday. and it just-- it just happened. I didn't plan on it. You ran into each other yesterday? Why didn't you tell me? I didn't-- I didn't want to upset you. Why would that upset me? You know. your anniversary. and I know that you're feeling sort of fragile-- Oh. fragile. So now I'm s-- I'm so lonely and pathetic that I can't even handle the fact that my best friend is seeing someone? - Is that it? - No. no. I just-- I-- I wanted to protect you. But. Iook. I don't need you to protect me from Na-nookie of the North out there. I told you I was fine. I know. Will. but you always say that you're fine. Because I am fine! You think I care who you sleep with? Sleep with as many guys as you want. I don't care if you sleep with two guys. or six guys or 11 guys or 27 guys! Okay. I get it. You know a lot of numbers. Don't feel sorry for me. Grace. okay? I'm fine. In fact. I'm more than fine. I'm perfectly fine! - Then why are you shrieking? - Because I'm not fine! I miss Michael. I don't want to. but I do. I know. And I sympathize. That's why I brought you up here. - And the thing that kills me - What? is that if a neurotic wingnut like you can get on with her love life-- - Okay. Iosing my sympathy now. - No. no. But. I mean. you know. if you-- if you can and I can't. what does that say about me? Will. it doesn't say anything about you. - I just got there first. - I know. I know. and I'm happy for you. I think it's great. I just can't believe that a lunatic like you got there first. Okay. we've been down that road already. I thought. All right. it's-- No. it's great. Maybe I need to be more of a lunatic. - I think you've got that color. - Yeah. Will: So what happened next? So then we kissed for a really long time? - Breath? - Perfect. He had brushed his teeth. but not right before. so it wasn't one of those Colgate kisses. Blah-blah-blah. get to the good stuff. I'm going to bed. I'll tell you the rest tomorrow. Wow. it was that good? No. it just doesn't happen that often. I have to ration. - You okay? - I'm fine. I wonder. how it's gonna be When you don't know me How's it gonna be When you're sure I'm not there How's it gonna be   
                




                    			- We still on for lunch? - Can't. - Well. what about dinner? - Can't. Well. how about I wake you up at 3:00 a.m. for some calamari? Can. but won't. Grace. you've been working seven days a week. I haven't seen you in like forever. The children don't even know what you look like anymore. Tell them I look like a young Rita Hayworth. Mmm What. I've been told. Will. I promise we'll do something soon. And if not. the day after soon. Nah. soon's no good for me. I'm having lunch at the whatchamacallit with what's-his-name. Hi. Jack. Bye. Jack. Dad. was that you? Okay. my court date is this afternoon. Do you have any last minute advice? Yeah. you shouldn't have slapped a meter maid. Honestly. Jack. sometimes I don't know where your head is. - Mom. is that you? - All right. You remember what I told you to tell the judge? Yes. It's not bad. but I've made a few adjustments. It's just the writer in me. Jack. Iisten to me. Don't recite any soliloquies. Don't sing any show tunes. Don't do the whole Perry Gayson thing. okay? What time are you heading downtown? Oh. uh. when l Forget all my troubles. forget all my cares And go downtown! Yo Petula? It's nice to see you're taking this so seriously. Actually. I am. That's why I would like a loan for $50 that I don't have to pay back for some blond highlights. I feel it will soften me in the eyes of the jury. There's the fridge. Get a lemon and rub it on your head. Ba-da-bum-bum. bum-ba-da-ba-da Ba-ba-bum-ba-da- ba-da-dum Bum-bum. ( both hum ) How can you-- I'm going downtown. And they said Tinky Winky was the only gay Teletubby. Nice advice. Counselor. I got 40 hours of community service. I have to pick up trash for the next two weeks. Yeah. at least this trash won't call you the next morning. This is so stupid. I can't believe my hard-earned tax dollars are being spent prosecuting guys like me - who did nothing wrong. - Okay. Jack. A) Nothing you've ever made has been hard-earned; B) You never paid taxes until this year; and C) You did something wrong. You Zsa Zsa'd a meter maid! You know. it's against the law. ( with Gabor accent ) Yeah. well. the law sucks. darling. Oh. now I've gone and worked up an appetite. Take me to dinner tonight. you know. for my last meal. Sorry. "Dead Beat Walking." Grace and I have plans. Oh. right. The missus before the mistress. ( phone rings ) Grace Adler Designs. Hi. Karen. Grace. the reason you're not in a relationship is on line one. Hey. what's up? Hey. are we still on for dinner? 'Cause there's this new kosher Chinese place around the corner. I'm in the mood for a little sweet and sour oy-my-back. I can't. Big problems with the Schneiderman townhouse. I have to rip up all the curtains and the carpet. Apparently. the only rug Mr. Schneiderman is interested in is the one that's on his head. Hey. hey. Tell-- hey. tell Karen I love her. Well-- I'll-- I'll wait. Let me wait. No. eat without me. I'm gonna be late late. Late late? Why-why-why-why-why? Because-because-because- because-because. Okay. Dorothy. I gotta go. - Hey. hey - What? Tell-- hey. tell Karen I want to French kiss her when I see her. - I'll see you when I see you. - Bye. Poor Will. Now he's being blown off by women. Ooh. hey. it's the elevator chanteuse. I caught your act between floors nine and two. Ah. all those years on the escalator have really paid off. - I'm Will. by the way. - Oh. I'm Val. I just moved in to 15F. Nice apartment. Good divorce lawyer. Oh. sorry. Was it messy? Actually. it was-- You know what? I'd really rather not talk about it. It just still sort of hurts my feelings. Oh. Val. I'm s-- I wouldn't have brought it up if l It's okay. I'm just kidding! - I'm kidding! - You-- yeah-- I was kidding. But. no. actually he was-- he was just a real jerk. though. you know? Whenever we argued. he used to-- he used to talk about himself in the third person. He'd be like. "Val. Jerry needs his space right now." And I'd be like. "Val's gonna take half your money right now." Will wonders why Val married Jerry. Well. as it turns out. I was a jackass magnet. but I've now been demagnetized. so all the creepy guys just slide off of me. Oh. thank you. Thank you. ( Asian accent ) You funny lady. ( Asian accent ) And you gay fella. Which actually kills me 'cause you're so cute. Yeah. What was the giveaway? I guess the abundance of boxer briefs. Ah. yes. The homosexual is the leading exponent of the underpant hybrid. Hey. do you want to have dinner later? You're probably busy. or is that weird that I just asked you No. no. no. I just got canceled on. actually. for tonight. Well. you know. there's a kosher Chinese place around the corner. Really? Hey. man. I could really go for some Mu Shu- it-wouldn't-kill-you- to-call-your-mother. What is this overstuffed bigness? This chair is where foam goes to die. It's no good. It's gotta go back. Oh my God. I'm so stressed out. Honey. you know. whenever I get stressed out. I always like to-- You always like to what? Gosh. I don't think I've ever been stressed out. I mean. why would I be? I've got practically no responsibilities. my job's a breeze. and I got a killer rack. Good morning! Oh. woo! - Aw. you know when you just said that? - Hmm. yeah? You got the cutest little wrinkles right there. What? Where? Feel that? That's stress. - Hey. - Hi. Grace Adler. Val Basset. - Hi. nice to meet you. - How you doin'? Nice to meet you. And this is Karen Walker. She uh. I use this term loosely. "works" here. - Nice to meet you. - Well. any friend of Will's is Grace. Val. you know. Will has just said the best things about you. and it kills me that I can't have lunch with the two of you - 'cause I have too much work to do. - No. you're not canceling again. I thought we could all have lunch together in SoHo. Oh. yeah. And after. we gotta go by Prince Street to see that guy who can put himself through the tennis racket. Frank. I love Frank. - That guy rakes it in. - I know. He's like the richest homeless guy in Manhattan. I know. he actually made the "Misfortune 500." - I was just going there. - I know. I beat ya. Get out. already! You. I'll see sometime before autumn. You know. unless. of course. there's another design emergency! Okay. I'm gonna need ten cc's of chintz. stat! Clear! Isn't it amazing. Val? Will is a guy. and yet he can achieve multiple sarcasm. Well. I'm really glad that we got to meet? Me. too. Ooh. you got a little eyelash right there. - Mmm. - Ooh. make a wish. No. she's still here. Bye. Nice to meet you. Bye. Oh. she's sweet. What? I don't like the way she's so chummy with your husband. Please don't refer to him as my husband. All right. fine. I don't like how chummy she is with your non-romantic life partner. Also bad. so please stop. okay? I'm glad he has a new friend. especially since I'm so busy. Your sexless lover! - Um dirty linen shirts? - Uh-- - Uh. your ex-husband. - Things you take to the cleaners. - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. um-- Oh. egg whites. - Uheh--- - Thoroughbred horses. Um.. Eh. James Brolin. - Things that are whipped. - Yeah! - Oh! - Time. Time. time. You guys are amazing. - Okay. I'm gonna total up your time. - Add it up. honey. Yeah. that's generally what I mean when I say I'm totalling it up. Rob. Mmm. Sorry. honey. Oh. gosh. Hey. may be a record. Will. - Record. Will! - Record! Woo! - Hiya! - Oh. hi. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. Hey. guys. - What are you doing home? - I thought you had to work? - Uh. yeah. I do. I just came home to change before my meeting. - We're playing "Pyramid." - I see. You know. Will and I are champions. Oh. I don't know. Grace. Looks like you got some competition. - Oh. yeah. - Yeah! I don't think so. Rob. Oh. I don't know. Val is awesome. Ooh Remember the time that Will and I finished an entire round in two minutes and 14 seconds. No way! Hey. Grace. we're the same. Come on. we gotta hurry if we want to make that reservation. Okay. You have a good meeting. and remember. there's no "diviner designer." - Bye. Will. - Bye. Val. Did I just call you Val? - Yeah. - That's funny. Things that aren't funny. So I walk in and this woman that he met like five minutes ago is in our house. playing with our friends. using our coasters. And he's dipping her. He actually dipped her. Oh. it's the oldest story in the world. honey. Boy meets girl. boy meets new girl. boy dips girl. boy sleeps with boys. Wait a minute. maybe that's not the oldest story. Maybe that's the Sal Mineo story. Ah. But. honey. you know. if you want to hold on to your man. you gotta work it a little bit. I mean. a slinky negligee. a nice perfume. Speak to him in a Dutch accent like his childhood nanny. I'm gonna call him for lunch. Oh. honey. if you're calling him at work. don't bother. - He's home sick. - No. he's not. Yeah. he is. Mm-hm. I called his office this morning. Stan's going hot-air ballooning. and I wanted to review my pre-nup. I can't believe I didn't know Will was sick. Why didn't he call me? I mean. who could take better care of him then I can? Val: Hello? Hello? Taking care of him when he's sick. Could she be more hateful? Val? What a surprise. Hi. Grace. - Hey. - Hey. I came as soon as I heard. How are you feeling? Oh. I'm at death's door. Only the bouncers won't let me in 'cause I don't look cool enough. Do you have any Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up Salt? No. Val. what are you doing here? Oh. just helping out our friend. Sickie. here. Aw. thanks. Well. I'm home now. so you can go. I'll help out Sickie. Oh. no. go back to work. Grace. We got it covered. I just made a pot of split pea soup here. so Sickie won't be Sickie anymore. Well. Sickie doesn't like split pea-- Uh. could you stop calling me Sickie? Or Sickie's gonna get pukey. Can you believe what I've been reduced to? I bitch-slapped the law and the law won. My poor little misdemeanor. Honey. your skin looks great. What are you doing different? - Just pore strips. - Oh. I hate this. I mean. New Yorkers are such pigs. Look at this. Ugh. chicken bones. and broken lipsticks and candy wraps. Looks like the inside of Grace's purse. Why don't people just use the garbage can? - Look at this. Ugh. - Oh. Who would throw away their phone bill in the street? I mean. would it be so hard for Soon-Yi Allen to walk two feet? - Oh my God. - Oh. We have Soon-Yi Allen's phone bill. Mama Mia! And I mean that literally. Karen. what should we do? Make a prank phone call! Come on. No. that would be wrong. One thing I've learned from this experience. is that you need to respect the rights of others. Come on. come on. come on. I can't believe I got that all out with a straight face. - I'll get the soup for you. - I got it. - I'll do it. - I'm already doing it. - It's my bowl. - My soup. - My stove. - My recipe. My God! - My skin is burning. - Oh my God. are you okay? What is the matter with you two? It's not "feed a cold. scald a fever." Grace. can I say something to you? And l-- I really-- I really mean this in the most supportive way but you seem very threatened and insecure. And I mean this in the most supportive way get out of my house. you wing-nut. Okay. I 'll go. I just want to let you know. you have a little soup there on your blouse. - Here. Iet me - I got it. Look what you did. This was a really expensive blouse! Hey-- Sorry. you had a little bit of that delicious split pea on your collar. I'm so sorry. I thought that was soup. but I guess it was part of the pattern. You know what? This is crazy. We are grown. mature women here. It's crazy. right? Okay. I'm gonna get my coat. Once again. girl-on-girl action and it's totally lost on me. Hey. hey. Gabrielle. Xena. Break it up. - What is going on? - She started it. - You did. - Nuh-uh! Okay. okay! "Nuh-uh." was just uttered by an adult. You're both taking a time-out. Go to your corners. Go on. - Bitch. - Psycho! Hey! Hey! - What is wrong with you? - Nothing. Well. fine. then I'll just go back to my room and you two can work it out in Thunderdome. It's just that you know. I've just been really busy. and I turn my back and I've been replaced-- by that wacko. It takes one to replace one. Wait a min-- wait a minute. Grace. are-- are you jealous? No. Are you kidding? Like I would be like-- I would even-- yes. I'm totally jealous. What are you lookin' at? The role of Will's best friend has always been and will always be filled by one scrappy little Grace Adler. Really? 'Cause it hasn't felt that way lately. Yeah. but you haven't been around lately. Grace. you've gotta let me date other women. I know. I guess it's only fair. I date other men. Yeah. I even sleep with some. Lucky. You two have something you want to say to each other? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm really sorry that I get a little crazy sometimes. you know? Can I sit down? It's just that sometimes I just feel a little envious of-- I mean. it's like-- I've never had a Will before. you know? I just moved in here after a very painful divorce. and. you know. I don't know anybody. and I just so wanted to connect with someone who didn't want anything back from me. you know? Oh. Val. I feel so awful. I'm just kidding! I'm kidding! I'm totally kidding. Like there aren't-- Iike there aren't a million gay guys in New York. you know? - You're a little nuts. right? - I've been told. - Well. I admire that in a woman. - Oh-- I like that little bra that you're wearing. Oh. and I liked your split pea soup. - Oh. thanks. - I got a little taste when you shoved my face in the rug. Hey. do you have a shirt that I could borrow to wear for the elevator ride? Oh. yeah. You know what? I have-- I have a great turtleneck that'll cover up that welt-- that I gave you. Oh. really? - Do you like blue? - Yeah. Straight guys have gotta be out of their minds.   
                




                    			Nope. Nope. No. No. - No. - Oh. whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. "Intimate Portrait of Molly Ringwald." And we're stopping because? Just to absorb the shock. It's official. They've run out of intimate people. Yeah. Look at this. Jack. warn people before you do that. Oh God. That reminds me. Will. - We're out of ricotta cheese. - Mmm. I haven't worked out in two days. I'm fat. Je suis fatty gay. I got busted at the gym. For what. feeling something other than "the burn?" Block. Thanks. Grace. No. they finally got hip to the fact that I have an illegal membership card. It's about time. You've been "Juan Mendez" for like three years now. Poor Juan. sitting around wondering what happened to his wallet. his thighs dimpling. This isn't funny! I have to work out. I come from a very fat family. We store more fat than otters. Well. why don't you join our gym? Oh. no-no-no. He-- He couldn't afford our gym. Oh. no-no-no. It's easy. Will has an extra buddy pass. It's good for a month. That is actually not my buddy pass. That's my things-to-do list. Oh. Iook at number one here. Pinch Grace. Ow. Put the kettle on. Mary. We're goin' to the gym! Ow! Let's work out during the day buddy. Unemployed guys are so much hotter. Eh. Jack? It's not really that kind of a gym. You know. I've got a lot of clients that work out there. I've been known to do business there. and you won't find anybody dancing on a box. You're just afraid I'm gonna cut into your gym action. Listen to me. I'm talking like a crazy person. Okay. you should have warned me they let naked old men walk around in here. Would you keep it down? Ooh. Iook. there's a guy over there who can bench 300 pounds. and I'd like to be a 160 of 'em. - Hello. press this. - No. Listen Swishburger. this is not like your old gym. Look around. Nary a nipple ring in sight. No men in Flashdance collars. And behold. women! There were women at my old gym. Not on their birth certificate. Fine. fine. Let's just do some crunches then. Fine. - What's that? - What? I'm wiping off my mat. Well. do you have to do the little flourish? It's like we're doing the Mikado here. Just-- gimme-- wipe the mat. Wow. Somebody's sports bra's a little snug. - I'm just saying is it so hard-- - Will? Richard. that's weird. - I was just thinking about you. - What were you thinking? - I'm thinking we should get together and-- - Hello. there. I'm Here's the thing. There's just a few sticking points on the Fellner merger. I'm not at all happy with the contracts. Well. fine. We'll get together sometime next week. - Good. - Thanks. counselor. A little rusty. but I'm impressed. You've still got the moves. Truman. What are you talking about. crazy? You know. swoopin' in with the old "jock block." The what? The jock block. Will. or as they say. south of the border. "EI jocko blocko." You're gonna have to help me here. I don't speak pidgin homo. The jock block. Will. Hello. You saw me goin' for that guy. and you cut me off at the pass. Oh. Busted. That's exactly what I was doing. Jack. Yeah. yeah-yeah-yeah. Shielding a desirable carcass from a much hotter vulture. This is what happens when you watch "Wild Kingdom" and gay porn with picture-in-picture. No. I will not lower my voice. You're my husband! Who the hell else am I gonna yell at?! Yeah. I know what I saw. Stan. You were looking at her. Oh. or maybe you were looking at. I don't know. a lamp. then her ass just got in the way! - Karen. maybe I should-- - Sit! I'm sitting. Karen: What? No. No-no-no. No more from you. Stan. You're done. I said that'll do. you unibrowed freak! God. I am so sick of Stan. Karen. maybe you should talk to your shrink about this. My shrink? Honey. I only go to him for refills. Maybe-- maybe you just need a night away from Stan. Well. the nights are definitely worse. His new thing is garlic pills. Oh-- No. Karen. what-- what I meant was call one of your girlfriends. Go out and have fun. You're right. Maybe I should call someone and do something. Did you want to - do something with-- - Oh. no-no-no. honey. no. - Oh. right. Of course. - No. Oh But if I did. what would that be? Um You could come over this weekend. We could hang out. watch movies talk. Talk? And how would that go? Well. Nell you might say something. and I might respond. And if it were interesting enough. you might be moved to-- Say something back? Yes! Yes! - You've done this before. - Oh-- Well. once at Betty Ford. but it just got boring. Okay. her. Could I ever have a body like hers? She appears to be of Nordic descent. They tend towards the lithe and bosomy. so as to help their buoyancy whilst navigating down the fjords. So no? Grace. you don't want that kind of a body. You're a heartier peasant stock. Yours is a body built for-- - What. Iinebacking? - No. no. You know. picking and carrying baskets of onions to market-- on your head. What are you doing to me? Oh. relax. If this were 1805. you'd be the hottest babe in the shtetl. Okay. this is how that should have gone. I ask you if I could ever have that body. and you say. "Why would you want to go down a notch?" Maybe I'm just working through some of my anger towards you. - What did I do? - You inflicted Jack on my gym life. You're mad at that? You know my new client. Richard Keller? He's in here the other day. and of course Jack has to meet him. And then he accuses me of trying to prevent him from picking the man up. - You jock blocked him? - No. I didn't-- How do you know the jock block? ( with Norwegian accent ) Oh. jeez. I overheard it at the salon. "Those gay fellas are a real hoot." What do you mean. how do I know? I know. I didn't block anyone's jock. Richard is straight and he is a new client. And Jack was just being Jack. You're overreacting. Who cares if Jack's at the gym? Well. sometimes he's just-- I don't know. sometimes he is just such a fag. Wow. Hey. Willie boy. how you doin'. man? How's it hangin'? Uh. hangin' well. Thanks for asking. D'you catch the Knicks game last night? It rocked. huh? Can't be National Butch Day 'cause the banks are still open. Hey. Betty. nice rack. - You're an idiot. - Thanks. Probably a lez. huh? You just spat on your shoe. What are you doing? Well. you know the old saying. Will. a rolling fag gathers no moss. What? Yeah. you can lead a fag to water. but you can't make him drink. A penny saved is a fag earned. - Jack. you-- - I heard what you called me the other day. Oh. Jack. I'm sorry you heard that. but you've got to understand. I work with some of these people. and you-- I wish you'd just tone it down a little. You're pathetic and gross. and there's nothing wrong with my tone. Yeah. except that whenever you open your mouth. a purse falls out! Are you afraid everybody'll find out you're gay? - Oh-- - Oh. - They don't all know yet. do they? - I don't know. Some do. some don't. I don't put it on my business card. "Will Truman. gay. Member since 1982." '82? Try '78. Mister-One-Time-At-Sleep-Away- Camp-Doesn't-Count. Look. the point is. I tell people when I'm ready. on my timetable. Oh. I know what this is. the 15 faces of Will. Well. Iisten. Will. I am what I am. And that makes you what. the gay Popeye? I'd rather be a fag than afraid. Hi. Jack heard what I said at the gym. Oh. Ouch. - What are you doing? - Oh. nothing. I have a friend coming over. I have girlfriends besides you. - Am I a bad gay man? - Yes. How can you answer that so easily? Because yesterday. when I saw that you didn't leave me any milk for my coffee. I remember saying. "Bad gay man! Bad gay man!" It's just that Jack said this thing about how there are 15 Will Trumans. - Oh. that's so wrong. - Thank you. There are at least 25. If you include Grumpy Morning Will. and Disco Will. and Sublimate-His-Rage- With-Cashmere Will-- Okay. this is-- this is absurd. Maybe I don't wear my sexuality Iike a sash and a tiara the way Jack does. but I am willing to put my gayness up against anybody's. You know what I mean. Wow. You're really embarrassed by Jack. aren't you? No. Sometimes. Can you blame me? - Hmm. - What does that mean. "Hmm"? Well. you know. sometimes the things we don't like in others. are the things we really don't like in uh - ourselves. - Thank you. Princess Of Tides. Look. what you called Jack was pretty harsh. I mean. what do you say about me behind my back? That you should never wear Capri pants. Okay. you keep that behind my back. All right. all I'm saying is. Jack has always been your best friend. What's changed? Really? I'm gonna go out. - Agh! - Oh. honey. sorry I surprised you. Oh. you didn't surprise me. Hi. come on in. Uh. my mother told me never to show up empty-handed. but I didn't have time to shop. so here's a dozen shares of GE. Great. I'll go put them in water. Please. sit. Oh. thank you. - Okay. you ready? - Mm-hm. I'm gonna make some popcorn. I have Ben and Jerry's softening. and I rented the last copy of "Hope Floats." - I'll get the booze. - There you go. Okay. ready? Go. Okay. so where was l? Oh. yeah. the guy was drooling all over your neck. Oh-- Oh. right. the drool. So lra is floppin' on top of me like a horny trout. And then all of a sudden. he lets out this scream that sounds something like "Ga-ga-ga! Ga ga." And phfft. it's over. - And that's how I lost my virginity. - Oh-- Oh. that is such a sweet story. You know. I didn't know there were people who were actually named lra. I don't know if there are people named lra either. but that was his name. So what was your first time like? Oh. it was awful. He kept twistin' 'em like he was trying to open up a jar of peanut butter. But it did get me out of having to write that term paper. Oh. ho-ho-ho-ho! No! Oh. yes. Let's have a toast to Mr. Tyler and his big A+. Okay. to Mister Tyler. He's a state senator now. you know. Ira's a nurse. Did you know that you're wearing my clothes? Yeah. honey. and you're wearing mine. Ah! I am! When did that happen? Well. uh. you wanted to try on my sweater. and I wanted to see what synthetic fabric felt like. and bippity-bobbity-boop. we're wearin' each other's clothes. Hey. you know what? This is kinda fun. Yeah! I love you! Ah! - Really?! - Uh-huh. - I love you. too! - Oh! Hey. buddy boy. Need a spot? No. Actually. I'm looking for a spot remover. - Buh-bye. - Jack. I'm sorry. Talk is cheap. Will. Okay. fly. fly. I mean it. Please forgive me. No. Or. as they say south of the border. no. Jack. come on. You might want to scoot away from me. If the other kids see us playing together. they might think you're a sissy. Won't you take me to Funkytown Won't you take me to Funkytown - I'll see you tomorrow at the meeting. - All right. -  Move to a town that's right for me - Richard? Wait a minute. Uh. before you go-- Won't you take me to Funkytown You see the guy singing "Funkytown" over there? Yeah. he's kind of hard to miss. Funkytown - He's way out there. - Yes. he is. I want you to meet him. Is this about business? No. - Will. I'm straight. - Oh. I know. I'm not. but it's not about that. Come on. Richard. this is Jack. my best friend. Hi. Nice to meet you. So. if there aren't any other singers you want me to meet-- I'll see you tomorrow. Jack. Well. that was almost a nice thing you did there. Will Truman. - It's a start. - What more do you want? I'd like you to realize that this is not about me. this is about you. I do realize that. - And I'd like an apology. - I'm sorry. - And a little respect. - You have that. And a full-time membership to this gym. - I respect you too much to pay for-- - Okay. forget the respect. - Just the full-time membership. - Fine. Ugh. I feel sick. I can't believe you made me eat so late. Certain foods should only be eaten after midnight. Iike kielbasa and stuffed derma. Anything encased. Anything that practices "safe pork." Sufferin' Sappho. It's a shame. An image like this is completely wasted on us. I don't want to be here when they wake up. Let's see if we can make last call.   
                




                    			What do you think of this? What do you think of this outfit? - It's fine. - Fine means crap. - It's good. - Good means fine. Well. if good means fine and fine means crap. doesn't that mean that good means crap? The most important interview of my career and you're doing a little word puzzlies? ( sighs ) I'm changing. ( with lrish accent) You don't freak out about your outfits. do you. Iittle leprechaun? Headline: "I'm in love." I must have missed that headline. Then again. I don't read the farm report. His name is Ramon. Thank you for asking. He's from the Dominican Republic. That's on the island of Hispaniola. I'm lovin' and learnin' at the same time. I'm listening and not caring at the same time. Poor. poor jealous you. stuck inside the nunnery while all the other girls run around in their miniskirts and take the pill. How do you solve a problem like Will Truman? Oh. Iook. it's Mother lnferior. Okay. I need shoe help. This one says I'm confident and capable. This one says I spend way too much money on shoes and I'm worth it. - Mmm. - What do you think? Let me see the other one. - Now the other. - The other. - No. the other. - Now. add the arms. Sunshine and rain. and sunshine and rain Okay. I'm not auditioning for the road company of "Babes in Boyland." This is my chance to design Nathan Barry's house. The publicist? That man ruined my career! Wait. wait. wait. You had a career and you didn't tell me? I sent him a flyer to "Just Jack." But did he come to "Just Jack." where he would have been comped and given a drink coupon? No. Three people saw "Just Jack." Two of them were just us! Sweetie. come on. You gotta calm down. You look great. You are great. You can get this. All you have to do is figure out the one thing that you can bring to the table that nobody else can. and then you just do whatever you have to do to close the deal. okay? You go out there and you knock 'em dead. Our little girl's going out to face the world. Mmm. With two different colored shoes on. Grace! Next. Oh God. I want this job. I can get it. I can get it. Oh. Iook. Donna Karen's got a new fragrance. Oops. Missed again. Donna. DKPU. Wow. She must have opened with "What about wicker?" She wasn't even in there long enough to show her book. Oh. come on. She didn't have to show him her book. She was wearin' a Joan Rivers bee pin. Grace. stop fidgeting. Everything's gonna be fine. Just remember to let me do the talking. No. I'm the designer. You are the odd woman I pay to insult my clothes. I'll be doing the talking. ( sighs ) Suit yourself. Speaking of which-- - ( door opens ) - Hmm. No. no. we want that meeting. Right. well. you make it happen. - Antonia Hutt? - No. Grace Adler from Grace Adler-- - Antonia Hutt? - No. Alex. why didn't I get Antonia Hutt? I love her work. Marrakech? Well. then I hope she gets bit by a scorpion. So do l. It'll mean one less designer to compete with. ( snorts ) Book. please. Um. this is a pied-à-terre I did last spring. Uh. that's a house I did on Long lsland. That was actually published in-- okay. you're a skimmer. ( sighs ) I should have known. You have a skimmer's build. I don't really do humor. And I really don't like it in others. Oh. I'm not funny. Ask anyone. I'll vouch for that. Do I know you? Did we meet at Sharon and Todd's for Michael's party? No. I couldn't make it to Sharon and Todd's. But I was at Kate and Adam's for Robert's opening. I just saw Robert last week at Barbara and Fred's. Oh. I don't even talk to Barbara and Fred anymore. Not since the Eve and Dennis debacle. I live for Eve and Dennis. I saw them last night. We were with Sally and Eric. Nicki. Donald. Suzette and Peter. We went to Elaine's. Oh. I went to Elaine's once-- with Frieda and Sam. The Jacobsons? Friends of my parents. ( sighs ) All right. Iisten. honey. We can't stand around and chit-chat all day long. Does she have the job or not? - I like you. - Hmm. If you ever find yourself not working for her-- Oh. Nate. I find myself not working for her all the time. So. come on. Nate. What's the skinny? - I need to see your home. - My home? Don't do that. Don't buy time by repeating what I say. I need to see where you live. Why would I hire a designer who lives in a dump? ( gasps ) I'm not buying time by repeating what you say. I know you have to see where I live. Why would you hire a designer who lives in a dump? Here's the address. honey. Come by her dump tonight. Uh. yeah. why don't you come by around-- - I'll be there at 8:00. - Great. 8:00. Don't be late. Don't do that. Don't rhyme. - Karen? - Hmm? You know how you show up late. don't do any work around the office. don't know how to use the fax or the computer and spend your day criticizing what I wear? - Yeah. - Keep doin' that. Damn it! Stand! Oh my God. I can't get the lily to stand up straight. Really? Even after you yelled at it? What a disobedient lily. Maybe you should spank it. Maybe you should spank it. Hey. nervous. No one is gonna notice one wayward lily. Relax. He's gonna love the place. - Where are you going? - To the bathroom. Don't touch anything. You know what I mean. It's arranged perfectly in there. I can't make any promises. Grace. I may have to lift the toilet seat. But I'll make mental note of where it was and put it back exactly as I found it. ( knocking on door ) Nathan. hello. - May I take your coat? - No. Okay. I get it. It's a look. Um. may I offer you a drink? Oh. God. no. I'm having drinks with friends. Well. I've seen what I need to see. Good night. Grace Adler. I'll let you know on Monday. Oh. you must be Nathan. Will Truman. Welcome to our home. Well. I suppose I could stay for a bit. I really wanted to get my parents a very special gift for their anniversary. but I think cash is so much more personal. - Don't you? - Mmm. You do. Where's your washroom? Oh. it's just behind you. Thanks. It's going well. right? Yeah. it's going fine. I hope you get the job. but this guy is a creep. My God. he puts the "noxious" in obnoxious. Actually. he puts the "ob" in it. too. Well. I have to go now. Good night. Will. - It was nice meeting you. - Nathan. Grace Adler. walk me to the elevator. please. That's not really an indication of what I'd do for you. of course. - It's specific to Will and l-- - Is he involved right now? Will? Oh. um. no. Not at the moment. I think maybe I'll let you work for me. Grace Adler. How can I get rid of the "maybe"? Did you get a sense that Will was interested in me? Because I did. ( sighs ) I'm not gonna lie to you. Yes. I am very attracted to your roommate. I want him to call me and I want you to make that happen. Will that be a problem? - Do I have the job? - Is he gonna call me? - Do I have the job? - Is he gonna call me? - Do I have the job? - Is he gonna call me? - ( elevator rings ) - Yes. - Then yes. - Okay-- - So? - I got it. Tell me. I'll tell you later. Oh. come on. What did he say? What did you say? Did you bring something to the table that nobody else could? - Uh-huh. - Yeah. see? What was it? You. Jack: Come to lunch. Karen's in the car waitin'. She's payin'. You know. Jack. one of the perks of working is that you don't have to do this when somebody buys you lunch. Aw. somebody's not happy because somebody has to date a pig. That's not funny. That's not. wait. Iet me think about it just for a minute. Yeah. it's pretty funny. actually. Yes. I'm having one date with Nathan Barry. must you find humor in my pain? You know what's going to happen. Mmmmmm What's that? ( mimicking pig ) Ree-ree You and I have very different ideas about what a first date entails. But they all involve the goodnight kiss. Yeah. well. I can assure you this one will not. Hey. come on. boys. What's the hold-up? I only get four hours for lunch. Karen. wait a minute. Come on in. Will. you want to know how to get through this date? I'll show you. Oh. honey. You still doing the law thing? Will: Hmm. Honey. you still doing the l-married-for-love thing? No. Okay. focus. All right. the key to dating the undesirable is visual-ization. All right. now it's the end of the evening and Karen. who is totally smitten with me at this point-- thank you very much-- awaits a goodnight smooch. Oh. Lord. Jack. I just reapplied. And as she leans in-- Ieaning. thank you-- I don't see Karen. I see Dawson's Creek heartthrob James Van Der Beek. Now. this is an image that works for me. okay? Utilizing my powers of concentration. I am now able to kiss James. I mean Karen. No. I mean James. See? Any disgust I may feel is now eased by visual-ization. You know. I think I may join you for lunch-- 'cause here comes breakfast. I know what you mean. Politically. I'm tolerant of the heterosexual lifestyle but the actual act is rather revolting. So Dominick was just up the beach from me. and Jerry and her brood were next door. so I spent most of my vacation time hiding. I don't know who Dominick and Jerry are. Don't do that. I'm not playing that. You know which Dom and Jerry I'm talking about. Oh. right. right. right. Dom and Jerry. I always forget which one's the cat and which one's the mouse. - They're both cats. - Ah. Excuse me. this chicken is in strips. I asked that you cube it. You could get it right. I'm here enough. - How tough is it to cube a chicken? - Well. Iet's see. Chicken times chicken times chicken-- No. no. no. no. Silly doesn't really work for me. Well. good thing I left my whoopie cushion in my other pants. No. no. Give it some air. It'll open right up for you. Air. ( sighs ) So what are you working on now? You know what I'm working on. Don't do that. I'm not doing that with you. Okay. Iet's try Potent Potables for 200. You've seen the photography exhibit at MOMA? Oh. come on. Iet's not go there. Stay in the moment. You can still win me over. Smaller cubes. So. you're some kind of a lawyer? Oh. come on. don't do that. Don't go there. I'm not doing that with you. I'm sorry. I'm not following you. I was just playing with you. How boring. Do you enjoy playing games? Yeah. I'm a big game player. One of my favorites is the being-nice-to-waiters game. Yeah. if you win. you get to not go to hell. You are so like Tom. Tom who?! Who is Tom and why don't these people give you their last names? Wow. You are arrogant. Be careful. Will Truman. You wouldn't want to offend me and force me to rethink Grace Adler. Are you kidding me with this stuff?! Nobody actually says something like that they're twirling a moustache and tying Lillian Gish to the train tracks. - Check. please. - I'll take the check. - No. give it to me. - I have more money than he does. - Yeah. but I'll tip you. - And we have a winner. Hi. Hi. He called. Ugh-- Grace. I'm sorry. I couldn't control myself. It's just. outside of a circus contortionist. he's the only man I ever met that could actually blow smoke up his own ass. He's pretty bad. So he fired you? Actually. he doubled my budget. He doub-- that's fantastic. Why are you eating a Ding-Dong? I did something bad. - Tell me. - You don't want to know. Honey. after a date with Nathan Barry. nothing could be that bad. - Even a second date with Nathan Barry? - Wait. what? 'Cause I told him you would go out with him again. Grace? What-- Will. he loved you! Ugh He said it turned him on the way you were totally direct with him and-- and put him in his place. Yeah. well. Iet me be totally direct with you. I would rather go out with an Ebola-riddled gibbon monkey than this guy. Hell. I'd rather go out with Pat Buchanan than this guy. Will. please. Please? Remember how you told me to do whatever it takes to get this job? I'm still doing that. - I can't believe you're using me like this. - Just one more date. By then. the only thing he'll want to fluff is the curtains. Oh. come on. Will. I've done things for you that are just as bad as this. without even batting an eye. Name one! I won't belittle this with examples. Will. Will. Will. please. Please. I'm begging. One more date. Please? Unless he wants a third. For God's sake. Grace. why don't you just dress me up in fishnet stockings and thigh-high boots? You'd do that? This isn't right. I should be designing this place. Hey. fellas. Either sweat less or crack a window. huh? I can't believe Will blew this for me. It's so ridiculous. I wasn't prostituting him. All I asked was that he make himself romantically available to someone he doesn't particularly like so I could make a little money. He wouldn't even do that! Hey. what's going on? Did we get fired? Where have you been? I've been talking about this all day. Oh. spring edition. You've been nothing but a series of hoots and clicks to me since breakfast. ( sighs ) Well. we haven't officially been fired yet. but Will refuses to go out with Nathan again. so-- - So he fired you? - Well. not yet. but-- Well. wait. Honey. wait a minute here. Listen. you know how you get a year's supply of Omaha steaks every time you buy a Bentley? Um. no but I'm very interested where this synaptic misfire's gonna land. Grace. you are the luxury automobile. Will's just a piece of meat. Are you really so insecure about your work that you don't realize that Will is just the free gift with purchase? But Nathan would have never given me the job-- Oh. bu-bu-bu bu-bu-bu bu-bu-bu-bu-da-da-ga-ga- go-go-too too-- Honey. I'm usually not this sensitive. Ride the wave. Did it ever occur to you that maybe Nathan Barry might let you keep your job because you're a good designer?! - You know. you're right. - Yeah. I mean. people hire me all the time and they love my work. I mean. why would Nathan blow all this money if he didn't really think that I knew what I was doing? I am a Bentley! - Okay. I'll go out with him. - Oh. thank God. He would have fired my ass just as sure as I'm standing here. I called him. He's on his way over. There's a few things I want to say to him first. Talk to him. don't talk to him. I respect anything that you think you need to do. I can't get you out of my head. I want to live here. I want to have cats with you. - Whoa. whoa. whoa. Hold it. - No. Iet me finish. White Siamese. I've already got them named. Grizabella and Skimbleshanks. The railway cat. Okay. problem. Warm and fuzzy doesn't work for me. You can go now. Grace Adler! We need to discuss wallpaper! Oh. yeah! That was good! That was good-- Okay. you don't care. But Grace is gonna love that.

Your turn. - Ha! - You guys are up by a lot. - Maybe we should just. you know-- No. don't even-- play. That's Grace-speak for "good luck." Okay. and - time.

Uh-- uh ( growling) "Maniac"? Um. uh. "Seizure"! Oh. come on! Um-- I'm not having fun. Yeah. I give up. - You give up? - Yeah. That was so easy. It's "Psycho"! This is what you should have done. Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! - You would have gotten that. right? - Says "Psycho" to me. - See? Why'd you give up so fast? - Because-- because we have a really big day and. we have to go. - Honey. we're in the middle of a game. - Big day. Rob! Oh. right. Tomorrow is a big day. I wish it were a small day. but it's not. It's just big. That would make it "Big Wednesday." - I want to go. - Okay. Okay. well. bye. It was uh-- Hey. it was really fun. - Yeah. good seeing you. - Yeah. really good seeing you. - Really. really good seeing you. - Okay. Grace. You win. So what's with Rob and Ellen? I think they felt bad about losing. Well. I wish they wouldn't take it so seriously. - Yeah. it's just a friendly game. - Yeah. - We kicked their asses. huh? - Like the dogs they are. Oh. yeah. So uh. what kind of work do you do here? Hmm. Honey. silk collar. blue collar. They don't even mix in the washing machine. Lady. I'm only trying to make polite conversation here. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bah-- fix the heat. Our relationship is already too involved. Next thing I know. I'm gonna be gettin' Christmas postcards from you and your red-eyed brood. Hi. Kare-- Oh. well. Iook at that. "Butt Crack Theater." Let's just hope it's a one act. Okay. I need to borrow $300. I want to be the first one in my prayer circle to have the new Birkenstock slip-ons. Yeah. Well. keep prayin'. Mary. 'cause you're not gettin' it from me. Qu'est-ce que c'est? Jack denied? What's going on with you? Did someone throw another bucket of blood on one of your furs? I'm gonna-- No. honey. I-- I had a near-death experience last night. Wow. Did you see God? Is she mad at me? Come on. Jack! This is serious! I was at The Palm last night with Stan and he started choking on his rack of lamb. Well. my first instinct was to watch it play out. but he was really attracting attention. Oh my God. is he okay? Oh. yeah. He's fine. Javier. the busboy gave him the Heimlich. Gosh. I should probably get him something as a thank you. Maybe the rest of his family from Cuba. My God. Karen. that's awful. I mean. to watch your husband almost choke to death right in front of your very eyes-- Sidebar? That outfit is fabiola. Isn't it? I got it in three colors. Oh. honey. it was a wake-up call. I don't know what I would do without Stan. I mean. what is the combination to the wall safe? Where is the key to the safe deposit box? What if he did something stupid and left all of our money to some school or something? I mean. Iook at me. I'm still shaking. My cousin Rosie once choked on a piece of sausage bread. Oh. that's lovely. You should remember that and tell it at dinner parties. Oh. I'm so on edge. Well. Karen. if you had invited me to dinner-- which you didn't. thank you very much. busy anyway-- I could have saved Stan's life. I know CPR. - You know CPR? - Oh. yeah. I had to do it on my father when I told him I was gay. Only I think it just confused him even more. What brings you guys here? Well. we were having lunch around the corner and we thought we'd stop by. Yeah. a little bit of bad news. We're not gonna be able to make it to dinner tonight. Oh. you're kidding. How come? Well. it's just-- I have a-- - We have to-- - Say it. When we play with you guys. I don't have fun. She doesn't have fun. Will. Why not? I mean. they're just friendly little games. No-no. Bare-knuckle boxing is a friendly little game. Charades is a vicious blood sport for Grace. We love hanging out with you guys. but when it comes to games. you know. she's too intense. When we played Pictionary last week. she laughed so hard at my drawings. - I cried on the way home. - She cried on the way home. Will. Well. that's just Grace showing enthusiasm. Everybody gets that way when they're winning. don't they? - We wouldn't know. Will. - Mm-mm. I'll talk to her. Okay? Come to dinner and worse comes to worst. we don't have to play a game. We can watch TV or something. Charlton Heston's on Leno tonight. We can watch Moses extol the virtues of semi-automatic weapons. So uh. did you talk to Will today? Ah. he left a couple of messages for me. but I couldn't return his call. - 'cause guess where I was. - Where? I was at-- actually. Iet me tell you this way. Three words. First word. Small word. - If. in.. - Uh. a - Ick. ill. is.. - Is - Him - Is He. uh-- ah. okay. Let me give you a little hint. Um. it's the single most common word in the English language. - And I just used it twice. - Is? - I? - The! The first word is "the." Okay second word. - Grace. I beg you. please just tell us. - Yeah. use your words. Grace. Okay. - I went to the toy store. - Oh. And I got the new Deluxe Scrabble! We could play like a marathon game. What do you think of that? I think you should return your damn phone calls. Take it easy. I'm sorry. Hey. what's goin' on? Well. Grace is making dinner and she just bought Deluxe Scrabble. She bought a game. Will. - I see. - Mmm. Well. I'm just gonna fix myself a deluxe drink  and then we'll have a long. Ieisurely dinner and see if we even get to Scrabble. - Oh. we'll get to it. - Huh? Today I found a couple of words that are worth a ton and they're each only four letters. I'm guessin' Rob and Ellen are thinkin' of a couple of choice four-letter words of their own right now. It doesn't matter. We're gonna gut 'em like fish. Grace. I don't think we should play a game. Why not? You get a little too competitive. - No. I don't. - Yes. you do. - No. I don't. - Yes. you do. Okay. see. I'm stopping. You see? When you play games. you just-- you can't control yourself and it's-- it's upsetting our friends. Is that true? Oh. Grace. you are such a dear friend. But um-- Rob? We don't really like playing games with you. - It's nothing personal. but you taunt-- - And you gloat-- And you're aggressive. God. you're just so competitive. You like to compete. Grace. Wait a minute. Wait. wait. Well. why is this all on me? - What about Will? - What do you mean. "What about Will?" You're just as competitive as I am. - No. I'm not. - Yes. you are. Okay. wai-wai-wait! Now. I like to win just as much as the next guy. but at least I know how to control myself. Oh. oh. And I don't? ls that it? I see. Well. if no one wants to play with me. then I'm just gonna go to my room and play with myself. By myself. I meant by myself. Katie. Katie. are you okay? No-no-no. Kare. Her name is Annie. Resusci-Annie. Or in a perfect world. Resusci-Andy. Honey. I can't remember my kids' names. okay? What's goin' on? What do I do? How do I bring it to life? Oh. wait. That sounds like me on my wedding night. Okay. Karen. Focus. all right? Here is a little acronym that'll help you. CTA-PTN-TTH-ABM-TM. Here's a little acronym for you. honey. What the hell are you talkin' about? CTA. Check the airway. PTN-- Good. Pinch the nose. TTH. Tilt the head. And ABM-TM. And begin mouth-to-mouth. ( singing to the "Alphabet Song" ) CTA-PTN-T. TH-A Hey. hey. honey. honey. I'm not putting my mouth on this thing. Who knows what those paramedics use these dolls for while they're sittin' around waitin' for a fire? Besides. these lips don't touch anything in a track suit. Karen. even fashion victims can be choking victims. Are you sure? Maybe it's nature's way of thinning out the herd. Don't say that. Every human life has value. Come on. just do it. do it. Come on. Oh. all right. all right. Oh. yeah! Will Truman is "Lord Of The Lanes." Okay. Ellen. your turn. - Come on. honey. - Don't psyche me out. Rob. Sorry. - Yay! Yay. for me! - Oh! - Yay. you! - Oh. way to go. Miss Ellen. Woo! - Oh. that was great. - Yeah. - Gracie. you're up. - Yeah. go. Grace. And remember. only Grace can put the grace in gracious. Or something like that. Go on. - Come on. Grace. - Go. Grace. Do that thing. There she goes. There she goes There she went. What-- what-- what-- what was that? I knocked two pins down. Yeah. I know. and you left eight standing. but this isn't golf. You want high numbers. That's what you want. high. I know. But look at me. Will. I'm fine. I suck. but I'm fine with it. This must be what it feels like to be my middle sister. I'm glad that you got that out of your system. but seeing as you're the baby daughter looking for daddy's approval. how about pickin' up the spare? Pick up the spare. How about that? Three. So this is like Bowler's Anonymous. "one pin at a time"? Hey. Grace. You are doing great. baby. Lovin' the new you. - They're loving the new me. - Lovin' the new you. We can actually win this. Okay. Iady. I'm almost done here. Enough with the "Iady." all right? I'm not an lrish Setter. - ( glass breaks ) - ( workman moans ) Oh. honey. no. Why are you grabbing your heart like that? Uh. come on. no-no-no. I'm sure it's just a stress thing. Yeah. it'll go away. Just walk it off. There you go. See? - Yeah. you're gettin' better now. - ( workman groans ) - ( thud ) - Uh-oh. Oh. Lord. Help me! Help me! I've got a beached ltalian in my office! Criminy. Okay-- Bernie. Bernie. are you okay? Thank God there are no security cameras in here to catch this. Damn it! You should be proud of yourself. You saved a life. Oh. well. as I always say. every human life has value. Oh-- But it was nothing. really. Just giving the breath of life. And these puppies are full o' life. Well. you uh. did a good job. ma'am. Oh. well. thank you. That's sweet. Well. I'll see ya. Oh. uh. but-- but uh. I'm not really sure I was doing it correctly. I don't suppose that maybe you'd walk me through it. I want it to be perfect. Oh. certainly. That's my job. Oh. well. great. Let me just uh. be your dummy. Karen. congratulations! Oucha-magoucha. How you doin'? Honey. do you think you could give Dr. Goodbody and I a few more minutes? You know. I'd love to. but Stan your husband-- You remember Stan your husband? Yeah. he's down in the car. With the kids. and the nanny and the goiter. His mother's here? Oh. damn it. I gotta go before Stan invites her to stay for the weekend. Take care. Hi. I'm Jack. I'm her CPR instructor. but I'm not quite sure I'm getting it. I'll be your doll. Resusci-Jack. Strike! I got a strike! - We dominate! - Woo! Four words! Sounds like! - We're kickin' your ass! - Boom! Oh. oh-- Ooh. ooh. ooh-- You okay? God. I'm sorry. - I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. - You okay? Okay. cool. Woo! All right. Ellen. you are doing great. She's bowling so great. - Wasn't that great. Will? - Okay. you're up. Grace. Okay. And now's your chance to tie us-- if you knock down 27 pins. And there's only 10 down there. Yeah. honey. that was the joke. Okay. now. Grace. Iosing gracefully is good. Winning gracefully-- much better. Lighten up. honey. It's just a game. I know. it's just a game. The neon wackiness tells me that. What are you doing? I wanted to see if the ball would make it all the way down if I just dropped it. Okay. I'm gonna call it. Time of death. 7:48. That's a good one. Grace. Good. Thought it would make it. Okay. ice cream? - Ice cream? - Oh. yeah. - Okay. - Excuse me. - Hey. hey. hey - Yeah. hmm? What are you doing? - I'm getting ice cream. - Yeah. yeah. Good Humor Lady. what's going on? I'm having fun? You don't have to lose to have fun. Grace. You're not France. Honey. I don't need to win. We're losing to Rob and Ellen. Rob and Ellen! We've never lost to them at anything! Well. maybe it's their turn to win. It's never their turn. They don't win. they lose. That's why we love them. It's the whole basis of our friendship. Yeah. we get together and we have pleasant little evenings with games and then we - gut them like a fish! - Aha! - Nailed! - What? - Nailed! - Not nailed. - Totally nailed. - What? You can't control your competitive nature any more than I can. - Oh. that is-- - Yes. you-- you just like to play the cool Will Truman while I'm all the intense crazy one. But once the bowling shoe is on the other foot. Iook who's the good cop and look who's the bad cop. That is the worst mixed metaphor you have ever uttered. You know I'm right. You're just as competitive as I am. and you can't control it any more than I can. - Not true. - True. - Okay. fine! - True. I admit it. We're the same woman. okay? I'm gonna need a little more. You're right. I'm just as competitive as you are. I love it when you're obnoxious. It unnerves our foes and it satisfies my lust for victory. - Okay. you happy? - Yeah. thank you. Could we get out there and try to win this thing? - Absolutely. - Okay. Oh. and by the way. once you let Jeannie out of the bottle. there's no way she's goin' back to that little circle couch. - So you're sure? - Come on. Iet's go. Loser's are buyin' drinks and I got a winner's thirst! She's got a winner's thirst. Will. Oh. I'm sure. Make 'em cry. Gladly. This good sportsmanship crap has been making me sick.

                    			What do you think of this? Too cute? Oh. not at all. I just-- I worry that the ragtag group of French pirates you stole it from are gonna riddle our home with cannon fire. Will. don't you know the old adage? Guys who wore jellies shouldn't throw stones. Touché! - So who are you goin' out with? - Uh. just a guy. Who? Stay there. I want to change my shirt. ( beep ) Hi. Will. it's Jack. Listen. two things. very important. I got-- ( beep ) - Hi. it's me again. I-- - ( beep ) And one more thing. you're never gonna believe who gave me-- ( beep ) Grace. hey. it's Danny. Just confirming tonight. If I don't hear from you. I'll pick you up at 8:00. Okay. this better work. 'cause it's either this or the peach bridesmaid's dress. So you're not gonna tell me who this guy is? - It's really no big deal. - No. come on. I'm just curious. I mean. is it a blind date. or a new client or I don't know. your ex-fiancé who you wasted two years of your life with until you finally came to your senses and left him at the altar. or what? Grace. why are you doing this? Why don't we try something new? Why don't we experiment with letting me run my life? What is that supposed to mean? Oh. it's just that sometimes. Iately. all the time. you have a tendency. habit. compulsion to run my life. Well. excuse me for caring. It's just that I'm the one who always has to clean up the mess. I'm like the little guy in the circus who has to follow the elephant around with the bucket. - That is a horrible analogy. - You know what I'm saying. Nobody asked for your help. Will. Yeah. said the girl who dragged me home for clothing advice-- at noon! - No. I wouldn't go with that scarf. - Oh. you're right. - So just stay out of this! - Fine. fine. All you had to do was ask. Fly solo! Thank you. that's what I prefer. to fly solo! Good! Before you do. I would rethink those pants. I heard that. So you want to have dinner tonight? Wait a minute. what-- what's going on here? I like you. Since when? Always. I don't like where this is going. What? I want your company. Okay. Grace has a date. With Danny. if you can believe that. Oh my God. Danny Bonaduce of the Partridge family? Uh. no. Good guess. though. Wait a minute. Danny. Danny. Danny. Danny? As in ex-Danny? Mmm. So how long did you wait before you told her it was a bad idea? Did you bite her head off and get to the creamy center? Rrrrr-- There is nothing wrong with sharing an opinion. There is when you do it. Will. It's called meddling. - And some of us are sick of it. - What are you-- What is everybody talking about? - I don't meddle. - Oh. no? Let's put Will through the meddle detector. shall we? ( makes beeping noise ) "Jack. he's already in a relationship." "Jack. he's a member of the clergy." "Jack. are you sure you want to date someone with three strikes?" Naughty boys need love. too. You know what I'm sayin'? ( intercom beeps ) Woman: Will. Karen and Rosario are here. Send them in. She's here with her maid? Jack's intrigued. Jack's leaving. Buh-bye. Oh. come on. Iet me stay. Karen and I are lovers. Karen. come on in. - Oh. hi. poodle. - Bye. poodle. Here. go buy yourself some lunch. Okay. keep me posted. I want to know if Ros-- Will. this is Rosario. It's nice to meet you. Okay. come on. honey. Sit-o down-o. Try not to talk-o. You hear how she talks to me? I speak English. okay? Oh. yeah. Except when it's time to work. Then it's all. "No hablo ingles." I work like a dog. It's not my fault that you and Mr. Stan are pigs. They're pigs. - I don't want to hear it. Rosario. - I'm not saying anything to you because ( bickering ) I'm nervous. Will. I can't live without Rosario. Please. you've got to help me out. - Maybe you're better off without her. - How can you say that. honey? - She's been with me for - I'm talking to Rosario. Why do you say that about Miss Karen? - I love Miss Karen. - Ah. I thought we talked about that suit. - Okay. Iisten. señorita. - Don't you start with me Ho-ho-ho. hey-hey. Wow. Tonight on Springer. "Shallow Societies and The Maids Who Abuse Them." Look. um. we can apply for citizenship or get a temporary work visa. but. you know. these things take time. Short of marrying someone. I don't see any quick solution. Well. how would that work? I mean. just for argument's sake. Well. she would get married. But. her groom to be would have to be a US citizen with no ties. Someone who's available. but. you know. not looking for a romantic entanglement. Hey. guys. Iook. I'm Will's last boyfriend. ( squeals ) What? Don't you want to hear about my date last night with Danny? None of my business. Schmear? - Schmaybe later. - Schmoot yourself. Anyway. it was-- it was really interesting. What a change since the last time I saw him. He looks great. he's happier. he's more focused-- And he's here! How about that? Hi. Danny. 'Morning. Hey. dude. ( chuckles ) Hey. Danny. How you doin'? All right. I'm all right. How about you? You uh. you know. you still into guys and all that? Yeah. I'm afraid so. The antibiotics just didn't seem to work. Before you say anything. Iet me just tell you something about Danny. okay? He's completely different. People do change. Will. and Danny has changed. In fact. he's changing right now. Thank you. I'll be here all week. No. seriously. Will. he really has grown. Okay. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Why don't you just punch me in the stomach? Wow. you can't hold back. can you? "Okay." Grace. I mean okay. You know. whatever you think best. Now you're just being cruel. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that I'm an idiot for going back into a relationship that didn't work. Well. first of all. how dare you call me an idiot?! And second of all. did it ever occur to you that maybe we needed this time apart to figure out how important we were to each other? Did that ever cross your mind. huh? Okay. fine. You raise a valid point. Do people really change or are they the same football-watching. steak-knife-giving. I-gotta-blow-outta-here frat boy they always were? - Ah-- - Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! Ho! Grace. I just said. "Ah." Yeah. but clearly. by. "Ah." you meant. "Okay." And I think we all know now what that means. What does it mean?! - Tell me. - Grace-- excuse me. But yesterday you told me that-- that you wanted me to mind my own business. Why do you now want to know what I think? Because I was testing you. And luckily. you passed. Because if you had given me your opinion on this very confusing issue. I really would have been mad. because I don't need it. I can make my own decisions for myself. okay? You know what? I gotta blow outta here. Why don't I walk you to the door? Yeah. Will. you mind if I grab a bagel? Just-- - Whatever you think is best. - Oh. you're good. So. Iisten. Gracie. it was uh - it was great seeing you again. - Yeah. What about maybe going away this weekend? You know what? Never mind. Never mind. I forgot that to have a relationship with Grace is to have a relationship with Will and Grace. It was always a threesome-- and not the good kind. - I'll talk to you later. - Okay. You know. it's funny. I always imagined myself a December bride. But there is something about a last-minute marriage to an illegal alien for $1000 that has a romance all its own. Miss Karen. I need a new dress. I can't breathe in this. Honey. it fit yesterday. before the frozen turkey mysteriously disappeared. ( bickering ) Jack. honey. take good care of my angel. For the honeymoon. I think I'm gonna bring Dan instead of Doug. Rosario. who are you gonna bring? Oh. Jack. Look at you. Is this the little girl I carried? Okay. I've drawn up your papers. I need you both to review them before your meeting with the immigration people. Speaking of which. pop quiz: Jack. what side of the bed does Rosario sleep on? She sleeps in a hammock on the sun porch. How the hell should I know? Because if you don't know. she's gonna be deported. Rosario. where does Jack work? He's on "The Guiding Light." Hey. I sent them a tape of "Just Jack." It's just a matter of time. "Solamente Jack." - Gracias. - Okay. Jack. this is serious. okay? This is not like the time you pretended to be Jewish so you could get that rabbi's phone number. Aw. what a mistake. A guy who can't go out on a Friday night. Honey. here's my credit card. Take your bride to lunch and pump her for some intimate details. Okay. come on. wifey. ( clears throat ) It's happy hour at Boybar. and if anybody asks. you're a drag queen. As long as they have chicken wings. I'm fine. So. where's Grace? I haven't seen her all week. Mmm. I don't know. Somethin' about work. I try not to get involved. Honey. what's this? What's happening? What's going on? Nothing. You're smelling her pencils. I just wanted to make sure they're fresh. All right. save it for the laugh shack. honey. I'm busy. Jack wants a monkey as the ring bearer. See you at-- no. I'm sorry. it's this whole-- it's this whole Grace and Danny thing. Does this not have "gigantic mistake" written all over it? - I don't want to be a meddler-- - Honey. honey. honey I sense this is gonna go on for quite a while. so let me just boil all this hoo-ha down to two important points. okay? One. brown is over. And two. you need to get a life. - You don't understand-- - Get a life. - But I'm Grace's-- - Life! All right. honey. You're done. That's good. Oh. I don't see you. This is so fun. This is so stupid. I look like a piñata. Yeah. and if I beat you with a stick. I could watch all my money fall out. Now. how about a little appreciation for all of this? All I want is my green card. not a party I have to clean up after. If it wasn't for this. you'd be flying back to Cucaracha on "Air Guacamole" with live chickens runnin' up and down the aisle! Listen. Iady. I'm gonna snap you like a twig and throw you in a bush. Yeah. I'd like to see you try. - Is this the thanks I get? - Why don't you shut up? - I don't need this ingratitude from you. - I tell you. you're crazy lady. Oh my God. my little girl is getting married. ( organist plays "She Works Hard For The Money" ) Hi. so nice to see you. Thanks for coming. Oh. you cut your hair. It looks great. Hi. how's the baby? Oh. somebody better lighten up on the fusilli there. huh? I don't know a person here. How about that? ( Wedding March plays ) - Oh. something's ripped. - Yeah. me. You like my new bracelet? Danny gave it to me. It's nice. Thank you all for coming. I know my husband Stan would have loved to have been here tonight. but regrettably could not attend as he is at home watching the Knicks game. However. I know that he would echo my sentiments in saying. Rosario. by marrying Jack. we are not losing a maid. we are keeping a maid. He gave it to me over dinner last night. He cooked. Can you believe Danny cooks now? Hmm. He's the bomb. Welcome. We are gathered here today to join this man. John Phillip McFarland. and this woman Rosario Ynez Consuelo Yolanda Salazar. in the bond of holy matrimony. And today. Rosario and Jack take their first step on the road to true intimacy. Shut up. you guys! Danny still wants to take me to the country for the weekend. - What do you think? - Depends which country. Chechnya. no. I also think I'm falling back in love with him. Oh. that is beautiful. Are you out of your mind? Are you so intent on ruining your life? My God. Pamela Anderson makes better choices than you. Gotcha! A toaster. Gotcha a toaster. You're registered for that. right? A marriage ceremony represents one of life's I knew it. I knew that you thought it was a bad idea. That's why I broke up with Danny yesterday. You wh-- why have you been baiting me for the last 10 minutes? Because I needed to make sure that you thought Danny was still a mistake. Of course I thought Danny was a mistake. Well. why couldn't you have expressed that earlier and saved me the agony of having to make my own decision? Believe me. Grace. I don't want you making your own decisions any more than you do. but you did tell me to butt out. Oh. don't play that game with me. You know damn well that butt out means back off temporarily until the right moment presents itself to butt back in again. Forgive me. I left my Grace-to-English dictionary at home. Next time. just. you know. just tell me when to butt in and when to butt out and when to do the hokey-pokey and when to turn myself around! Don't make me seem like the unhealthy crazy one when you're the one who wouldn't tell me what to do. Hey. hey. hey. How long have you two been married? 'Cause maybe it's been long enough. - We're not married. - I'm gay. Well. if you're not married and you're gay. what the hell's all this about? Wow. Jack just married Karen's maid. Unbelievable. I know. I haven't seen a kiss that uncomfortable since Richard Gere and Jodi Foster in "Sommersby." Why do I care so much about your opinion? Maybe because you don't trust yourself. Big question is. why do I care so much about how you conduct your love life? Maybe because you've got nothing going on in your own. Ouch. Not untrue. but ouch. I want to get married. Will. Well. maybe you didn't get the memo. but l-- Not to you. nervous. I want to kiss a guy under one of these things. Me. too. So want to see how it feels to kiss a guy under one of these things? I don't think we should live together anymore. The kiss wasn't that bad. Will. I don't think we should live together anymore. either. It's just when you moved in. it was so we could heal - and then move on. - I know. And I don't feel like I've moved on. Have you? I'm standing here making out with a girl. That's the international symbol for not moving on. Jack! Get your ass back out there and finish your chimichanga! You're the host! I don't want to! Rosario's been doing tequila shooters and she's gettin' real handsy. Jack: Aw. marriage sucks. You guys are the only ones who have it figured out. Come on. "Yack." We're going back out there. You've still gotta do the napkin dance with Rosario's mother. Hey. I've gotta lock up. You think you two can move on? Both: Yeah. - I think so. - I think we can.   
                




                    			Okay. this is the last one. I still don't get why you didn't just hire moving guys. I think we did fine on our own. I know but moving guys are hot. Firemen are hot. You want me to set something on fire? - So. do we like my new apartment? - We do. You're gonna love it here. I don't think it smells anything like cat pee. Why are you that man? Why are you an awful. heinous breeder of discord? - I'm kidding. - Are you kidding? - I'm kidding! - Are you kidding? It smells like room deodorizer. Cat-pee-scented room deodorizer. Shut up! This is a big deal for me. My God. you and I haven't spent more than 24 hours apart since I dumped my fiancé on our wedding day. What a proud moment that was. I'm gonna miss living with you. - Yeah? - Yeah. You know. the way we tell each other what to wear in the morning. The way you'd fall asleep in front of the TV with that little string of drool from the mouth to the shoulder. The way you'd try and make Jewish soup for me when I was sick. Or you'd perch on the balcony and make cooing noises. jutting your head back and forth ( imitates bird ) No. no. that was pigeons. I get mixed up. See? I'm trying to be sentimental here. and you're doing shtick. I don't want to get sentimental. If I get sentimental. I'll realize how much I'm gonna miss you. - I'm gonna miss you too. - ( Will laughs ) - Go. go. I don't wanna get upset. - Yeah. right. - I really like your new place. - Thanks. Call me when you get home. - First thing. - Bye. Bye. ( theme music plays ) ( sighs ) It is weird living apart. Yeah. We are living apart. right? I mean. this is healthier? Of course it is. Will. if it were unhealthy. we wouldn't even think to ask if it were unhealthy. Good point. Oh. so I gave my phone number to that guy at Borders Books. Phone number or business card? - Business card. - Not hot. Why. what? Hi. I'm intimidated by the possibility of rejection. But my secretary isn't. Call her. - I'm not intimidated by anything. - Then call. Oh yeah. and what if he's there. huh? He says hello. and where does that leave me? - You are a disgrace to your people. - Oh. see-- See. that is where you are wrong. You know. there's this whole myth it's easier when two guys are involved. Totally untrue. It is not so easy for a guy to meet another guy in this city. It's raining men! Hallelujah! Great night at the clubs. Jack was en fuego all night. The lovelies were buzzing around me like Iike what? Like moths to a flamer. Actually. more like fat to a Will is fat. Oh. touché. Okay. if you two are gonna play Bitchy McSnipe. I'm gonna head back to my place. I just don't understand why someone would subject themselves to a constant barrage of insults. day after day. Honey. your new dump smells like cat pee. Never mind. - Hey. poodle. - Who's your daddy? You are. Sorry to get you up so early. Karen. Oh. grow up. honey. I haven't been to bed yet. I need to speak to both of you about Rosario. Hey. hey. hey-- that's Mrs. Jack McFarland to you. I thought you were Mrs. Jack McFarland. And I thought you didn't have love handles. I guess we're both wrong. I got a call from my friend at the INS yesterday. and apparently the marriage between a 30-year-old gay man and a post menopausal Salvadoran maid flagged something in their computer. - Okay. are we done yet? - No. Look. they're gonna start making random visits to verify that Jack and Rosario are a real married couple. So. since their official residence is listed as your place. I think the best thing would be for Jack to move into your penthouse. - I just adore a penthouse view. - ( Karen laughs ) Ooh. my very own sexless marriage. Just like Will and Grace. No. not like Will and Grace. We don't even live together anymore. She's got her own apartment. Eight dysfunctional feet away. Lord. they're like Siamese twins who are joined at their boring personalities. Look. Grace and I are now totally independent. Separate homes. separate lives. separate-- Showering. showering. showering. My Lord. who Jiffy Popped her head? Well This? This is my penthouse view? Did you say my name? No. I said. "This is my penthouse view." But I understand it sounds exactly like "Rosario." You know. you never talked to me this way before we were married. Sorry. Rosie. I'm still a little tense about our conjugal bed. Hey. hey-- you're on the clock. tamale. Get to work. Listen. Iady. I'll squash you like a wormy apple. I hate it here. Karen. I want to be in the good part of the house with you. Well. that's sweet. Jack. But this is where the help stays. But I'm not help. Honey. you married help. you're help. Oh. and one other thing-- Stan sleepwalks. So if you bump into him in the middle of the night and he puts the moves on you. just go with it. You might get a mink in the morning. Hi. Just wanted to get some pudding. You got pudding at the market. I didn't. This is fat-free. right? - Yeah. - Great. Thanks. bye. Oh. it's chocolate. I thought I grabbed the swirl. You know. it's funny. speaking of chocolate versus swirl. I'm naked! I'm devoid of clothing. I'm in my nude. I know. you're so naked these days. Since when did you start being naked all the time? Well. since I started living alone. Hey. just 'cause you're naked doesn't mean you have to be cheeky. Bye. Will. Oh. remind me to get you a bookmark. Okay. this isn't working. Well. what are you telling me for? Talk to your urologist. Thank you. New York! Maybe Jack and Karen were right. maybe this moving across the hall hasn't solved our problem. Will. you just said Jack and Karen were right. I want you to cut wheat out of your diet. Come on. Iook at you. you're still totally dependent on me. Why. 'cause I borrowed a pudding pack? No. Grace. you borrow everything-- CDs. books. clothes. You spent half of last night looking through my apartment for bubble bath. - So? - You don't have a tub. I hope you're at least planning on buying that pillow a drink. Grace. do not deflect. You can't do anything without me. You can't have a bath. you can't eat pudding. God knows. you can't even cook a meal without me. Ha! That was me laughing without you because I happen to be throwing a fabulous dinner party tomorrow night. - You're not having a party. - Oh. but I am. Perhaps you don't know about it 'cause you're not invited. I'm not invited because there is no dinner party. Grace. Can't you see this arrangement isn't working? You have to move. And I don't mean across the hall. and I don't mean to another floor. You gotta move somewhere out there. Okay. now I'm confused. Do you want me to move east or south? Richard. hi. it's Will Truman. Yeah. Listen. I just wanted to call and thank you for recommending that John Updike to me. My favorite part? Um when you smiled at me and said. "Thanks for shopping at Borders." Yeah. well-- Iisten. I just thought I'd call and see if maybe you wanted to have a drink with me. Well. great. Hi. I'm holding for Richard. Oh. oh. hi. Richard. It's Will Updike-- Will Truman. Will Truman. not Will Updike. I'm a "true man" not an "up dike." Richard. could you hold for a minute? Idiot! Hi. So. um Iisten. you know when I was at Borders the other day. and you thanked me. I didn't say you're welcome. And l-- pardon me? Yes. I would like to have a drink with you. Tomorrow night would be good. Okay. I look forward to it too. Bye. Ow! ( knocking ) - Hi. - Hi. honey. Great dress. Where are Fred and Ethel? Here. I brought you a little housewarming gift. Oh-- oh. Oh. thank you. Thank you. that was really sweet of you. Oh. a martini set. And an open bottle of gin. Oh. Grace? What. um what is this about? Okay. you can stop with the hands of judgment. I don't have any furniture yet. so I thought it'd be kind of fun to have a picnic. Oh. I get it. Kind of like Saratoga before the races. Except there's no grass. or trees and of course. Saratoga doesn't smell like a litter box. Actually. it's just like the picnics I had growing up. Watermelon. apple pie. drunken bitter Aunt Greta. Karen. can you just please try and have a good time? Oh. okay. honey. I'll try. Oh. this is gonna be a wonderful party. a picnic! All of Manhattan will be abuzz. Speaking of Manhattans and a buzz ( knocking ) - ( knocking ) - Coming. coming. coming - Hi. Hi. - Hi. This is for you. Thank you. Hi. Come on in. come on in. So isn't it cute? - It's so cute. - So. so cute. Where's Will? - Oh. he's not coming. - Oh. - Did you guys get into a fight? - No. So. I don't get it. He's in his apartment. and I'm in mine. - throwing a dinner party. - Oh. Who cooked? I did. She cooked. Rob. So. uh. is Will coming later? Karen: Oh, for God's sake, it's just gonna be the four ofus. Grab a bottle, hunker down and pray for daylight! Does this go with this? Does "no" go with "way"? Okay. you're no longer helping. Out. I don't need you here doing a Joan and Melissa Rivers on me. Oh. Cybill. what's with the gloves? Did the eczema flair up again? Out. out. out. Now. Will. I understand you're anxious 'cause Grace isn't here to dress you and burp you. But. tonight's gonna be great. I think it's fantastic you're getting out there again. and watch. you'll see. everything's gonna be just fine. (phone rings ) Hello? Oh. hi. Richard. Uh-oh. Yeah. that's fine. I'll be here. take your time. - He's just running a little late. - Ooh. Ouch. Wow. You okay? What do you mean am I okay? Why wouldn't I be? Tsk. tsk. tsk. Will. have you totally forgotten how to speak our language? "Running late" is gay for "I'm blowing you off." Really? What's gay for "Get out"? That would be "Good morning." Good morning. Jack. So how's the soup? Everyone loving the soup? - It's a little cold. - It's gazpacho. It's supposed to be cold. Okay. it's bad. - Honey - What. what do you want me to say? You want me to lie to her like I did about the hors d'oeuvres? - Honey-- - No. it's okay. it's okay. I mean. the most important thing is that everyone's having fun. Honey. what's the second most important thing? Oh. ahh. Do you have a chair? Sitting on the floor. really bad for his back. Yeah. I'm like the AI Pacino of back problems. - Sciatica. sciatica. - ( laughs ) Rob! - Oh. God! - Rob! Good Lord. where'd you find these two? You know what. I bet we can borrow a chair from Will. No! No. no. no. We don't need Will. I'll make a chair. I'll make a chair. I'll just-- Iook. Iook. Iook. I'll just throw a sheet over this box Look. we're having fun. We're improvising. We're draping. see? And we're sitting. And we just located my missing Waterpik. Grace. you're stuffed in a box getting rid of ass plaque. Take it as a sign. This evening is a bust. ( Grace laughs ) It's not. Honey. honey. it's over. okay? You never had a chance in hell without Wilma. Now. you know I've never been a big fan of Will's. but let's face it. the girl knows how to entertain. okay? Right? Am I right? Obviously. I know how to entertain. - What's that smell? - It's cat pee! A cat has peed. the entire apartment is soaked in cat urine. okay? Smells like rosemary. Oh. that's the chicken. Excuse me-- - Oh. thank God. Will! - Will! Will! Hi. how are you? Good to see you. - Hi. hi. - Will. what are you doing here? I just-- I just need to talk to you. I had a date with the Borders guy and he called to say he's running late. That was an hour ago. Is that some kind of code for he's blowing me off? Will. excuse me. but you're gonna have to leave. 'cause I'm in the middle of a very lovely dinner party with my friends. Put down the cheese and return to the picnic area! Grace? Did you hear me? I really need to talk. I'm sorry. you need to leave. 'cause I'm about to serve the entrée. - I'm just asking for a little advice. - No. you asked for an independent life. And that's what you have now. so go home. read in the nude and play with your pudding. Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. You know. I've been thinking and maybe you're right. you know? About me being too close and not being independent. and No. no. I was crazy that day. All I'd had for lunch was Bugles. - So I didn't-- - No. no. You were right. this across-the-hall thing. it was a bad idea. So tomorrow I'm gonna wake up. I'm gonna get the paper. and I'm gonna start looking for a place somewhere - out there. - Grace. you don't have to do that. No. I do. I do. I mean. I can deal with the occasional bad dinner party. - Awful. by the way. - Mmm. I blame the ghost of Little Kitty Pee-a-lot. But if me living this close is turning into some sort of crutch for the both of us. then it isn't working. - And I should-- - You-- Mind if I take that? I'm starving. Hi. - Or maybe it is working. - I'll call you. - He's cute. Is he funny? - Gotta go. Okay. call me. call me. No. wait. he's a cutie. Did I interrupt? Am I about to interrupt? Bye bye. Grace. I'll tell you everything over breakfast. Love you. ( Western movie playing ) I'm going to Costco tomorrow. Do you need anything? Socks. The kind with the ball on the end. or the plain tubes? Sweetie. you choose. it's six of one. I like a tube sock on a man. Me too.   
                




                    			Who was a good boy at the doctor. huh? Who was a pretty bird at the doctor? And who got the pretty doctor's phone number? Yes. Pretty bird. pretty bird. Jack. I've got a tenant's meeting in five minutes. I don't want to have to deal with a lot of shrill squawking. feathers flying. biting. and that bird has got to go too. - ( bird squawks ) - I'm not too fond of the tie either. That's our cue. Guapo. Oh. Iook. Will. I'm flipping you the bird. ( bird squawks ) Uh. Grace. a little tip-- when you shadow. a good rule of thumb is less is more. Okay. All I wanted to do was spend a cozy evening at home by myself. So I try to light a fire and the next thing I know. the entire apartment is full of smoke. - Did you check the flue? - Yeah. - Did you use dry wood? - Yeah. Did you know your fireplace has been sealed. effectively rendering it non-functional? - No. - Might be your problem. - Why is it sealed shut? - Three years ago we were bringing the fireplaces up to code. and it got too expensive. So. now some of them work and some of them - How come your fireplace works? - Because I'm sleeping with the president of the tenant's association. - That's you. - Yes. and I'm tender but rough when I need to be. Okay. Mr. Rough and Tender. you have to do something. How can I have a groovy bachelorette makeout pad if I don't have a little fire to set the mood? Smoke in bed. I have a tenant's meeting. this discussion is closed. Not unlike your fireplace. Wait. wait. why is this discussion closed? - Give me one good reason why. - Uh 'cause? I'm gonna need a little more than that. Okay. because. Come on. - This isn't fair. - Well. Iife's not fair. Grace. Grow up. Whoa. Did you just tell me to grow up? Yes I did. And when you grow up. you'll understand. - What are you doing? - You're having a tenant meeting. I'm a tenant with an issue. You're a tenant with a lot of issues. ( theme music plays ) Okay. all in favor? Opposed? It's decided then. a shirt must be worn when using the laundry room. - I just don't understand-- - It's over. Mr. Zamir. - But it's 1.000°-- - Mr. Zamir! All right. now the carpets are being cleaned next week. Iight bulbs replaced in the stairwell. Anything else? Anybody? Mrs. Pressman. Somebody stole my umbrella. Is this a new umbrella. or is this the same umbrella we discussed July 28th. August 28th. and the September 10th special umbrella meeting? It's very similar to the one Tim Kaiser in 12B has. is all I'm saying. Duly noted. Okay. is there anything else? Well then. I move this meeting be adjourned. All in favor? Hello? My hand has been up for like an hour. I'm down three ring sizes. - Grace-- - Thank you. Hi. I'm Grace Adler. 9A. I'd like to talk about fireplaces. Now as I understand it. some of them work and some of them don't. I'd like to find a way to get them all working. - I thought none of them worked. - Ah! No. Some of them do indeed work. The rest are sealed shut. Do any of them work? That's what I just said. some of them work. some of them don't. I'd like a fire but he won't let me. You want heat. here's an idea. Iight your mother on fire. I would like a fireplace. Where would we get the wood? You see what you started? Hey. people. people. People. now listen. we settled this. We could have all had our fireplaces brought to code. but then our maintenance fees would have gone up and I just assumed nobody would want that. Uh. interesting how he made that assumption just after his own fireplace was done. Thank you. thank you. Now. now. now. now look. we had just voted an increase. so that we could have the lobby floors done and that's it. That's what we decided on. Trust me. it's what you wanted. Okay? Meeting adjourned. Whoa. Whoa. whoa. whoa. Sit. Sit. sit. sit. Sit. Sit. - Mr. Zamir. - But I want to go-- Mr. Zamir. Now are you people noting this arrogance? He's not your president. He's not acting like a president. He's acting like a king. - Or in his case-- - All right. Grace. they get the point. All I'm saying is we can't all have fireplaces. - See? He's doing it again. - Okay. you know what? Enough. - Everybody wants to go home. - I don't think we're done here. Oh. we're done here. Good night. everybody. Elections are next week. but since I'm running unopposed again. sign the ballot. don't sign it. whatever you want. - Will: Good night. - Wait. not so fast. Hey. hey. Hey! I think you're all going to be surprised to see another name on that ballot. Me. me! I'm running for board president. Everybody: Ohh! Hold still. Claus von Puppy. We're accessorizing. Ooh. Iook at you. all "street." You're like Notorious D-O-G. I'm the pooch with the cold wet snout lf you sniff my butt then I'll ask you out Word to the bitch. I told you to keep that dog off the bed. I made it once today. I don't want to make it again. Rosario. a marriage is about compromise and compassion. okay? Maybe you could. oh. I don't know. pick one? Dogs rapping. strange boys calling in the middle of the night. When I prayed to the Madonna for a husband. maybe I should have been more specific. Oh my God. you pray to Madonna too? Jack. sweetie. uh we need to talk. There's something that-- oh. it's you. If I understand our roles correctly. you should be cleaning something. and I should be drinking something. Freshen. Drinking at 10:00 in the morning. Where I come from we have a word for people like you. Oh. that's funny. We have a word for people like me here. too. It's called boss. Now do what I tell you. Honey. sit down. I need to talk to you. Okay. Iisten. Sometimes bad things happen to good people. And sometimes bad things happen to you. I'm not following. Oh screw it. Bird is gone. Guapo. something happened to Guapo? ( screams ) Well. I opened the window to yell at somebody on the street for wearing palazzo pants. and before I could say. "Hey. Ioser." bird took off. You mean-- oh my God. That bird was my life. we've been through everything. When Steve dumped me. Guapo was there. When Raoul dumped me. Guapo was there. Mike. Dan. Tom Guapo. Guapo. Guapo there. there. there. Oh. honey. what can I do? Do you want another bird? No. how can you even ask me that? If my grandmother died. would you bring me another racist dowager with a purse full of diabetic candy? I don't think so. Guapo was my baby. - Oh. Jack-- - Leave me alone! Oh. you know. uh when I get depressed nothing perks me up like a little spending spree. - Come on. honey. Iet's go shopping. - I don't want to. - We'll go to Barneys. - It won't help. - We'll skip the sale rack. - I don't know. I'll let you French kiss me in the elevator. - Well. maybe just an hour. - Come on. come on. Now get yourself together and I'm gonna go and give driver a B12 shot. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, what the hell, honey. While we're out, maybe I'll buy you a new Rolex. Coming. Wait. hold the door. hold the door! Hold the door-- oh! - ( elevator door dinging ) - Ow. ow. ow. ow. ow-- Grace! "Vote for Grace. Win the Race." That's cute. Shouldn't the rhyme go more like. "Vote for Grace. she just wants to get it on in front of a fireplace"? Oh. Will. I am so far beyond the fireplace. I'm doing this because your arrogance is off the charts and someone's got to bring you down a peg. And that someone is you? Allow me to turn up my nose and laugh, French-like at you. ( mimicking laugh ) Will. you can't win all the time. Really. I can't? 'Cause it seems like I pretty much have my whole life. ( mimicking laugh ) Sorry. I saw how much you enjoyed that the first time. Laugh all you want. Gerard Depar-doo-doo. 'Cause when they tally the votes. the person who laughs last is gonna be the last person laughing. Don't act like that didn't make sense. Grace-- Iook. I don't want to play these games with you. okay? The tenants love me. face it. You don't stand a chance. - Hi. Mrs. Pressman. - Save it. Will Truman. I'm voting for Grace. She told me how you've been eating my fruit-of-the-month. Wait. what-- I-- I-- I ate a Japanese pear. Once. And you were in Boca. Thief. You're a thief. - I'm voting for Grace. - But-- Nice. nice. Grace. What? Smearing my name with the tenants? Hey. she asked me what time it was and it just came up. - I think these tactics are pathetic. - Yeah? Well. "All is fair in love and war." ( mimicking laugh ) Now. that shopping spree helped a little bit. didn't it. poodle? - I guess. - Oh. come on. I saw you crack a smile when I had that salesgirl fired. Oh. but I've got six children and my husband just left me. Come on. I saw you. you little devil. I saw. - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh. Iook at Guapo's cage. It's so empty. Iike my heart. Oh. keep your chin up. Tomorrow. we'll talk travel. Oh. say. have you done Greece? Oh. wait a minute. of course you've done Greece. No. we'll think of something. Living in a material world 'Terial. oh. in a material world And I am a mater-- You again? Oh my God. I'm Tippi Hedren. Get out of here. go. shoo! Shoo! Shoo. shoes. That's what I can get tomorrow. I am rather fond of the new Gucci mule. Wait a minute. what am I saying? You're my Guapo. you're my baby. Come here. Guapo. Yes Guapotito. Now look at me. Am I the sort of man that would give up his precious little baby for a $10.000 watch? Now Guapo. the closet's not that bad. Will was in there for 20 years. - Mrs. Carr. a lemon square? - How about a flashlight? ( gasps ) They're yummy! - Vote for me in the election. - Vote for experience. I've been do-- I thought you had nothing to worry about Frenchie. That's Mr. French to you. Oh. my eye. Gracie. you okay? Pretty shoes Pretty shoes Who's a pretty pair of Prada slip-ons? Oh. you are. Yes. you are. - I don't feel right. - Ohh. Guapo! I just feel terrible about the last few days. trying to make up for the loss of a pet by buying you stupid little gifts. No. no. the gifts aren't stupid. The gifts help. No. honey. it's wrong. in fact it's-- it's just insulting. There's only one thing I can give you that-- that has real value. - Your love? - A boat! Oh my God. Karen. I don't know what to say. Say. "Thank you. Karen." Thank you for a boat with a mahogany deck. a cruising speed of 40 knots. and a staff of cabin boys who are either gay or questioning. Yeah. Oh my God. it's one out of every 10 man's dream. I've never-- nobody's ever-- you know. I don't-- oh God. Karen. I can't keep it up. I've been lying to you this whole time. - I know. - Guapo's in the closet right-- - ( bird squawks ) - Wait a minute. you know? - How? - Poor. naive Jack. You really think there's an inch of this place I can't see on video? There. there. there and there. Oh my God. Karen. I don't know what to say. Say hi to Stan. Hello. Mr. Walker. So I guess I should give you the keys back. No. keep 'em. They're to Grace's office. Go ahead. help yourself. take whatever you want. I'm so ashamed. Karen. I'm so sorry. That's okay. A part of me is angry. but a part of me is proud. The rest of me is just drunk. Wait a minute-- if you've got cameras everywhere. does that mean you've seen-- Yes I have. honey. and good for you. "L." "L" stands for loyalty. That's what Grace Adler is all about. "E." "E" stands for no more smells in the elevator. "R." responsibility. - So in conclusion - Arthur. wake up. she's concluding. pick a winner. Pick change. Pick me. Pick. pick. pick. pick. pick. pick. Change is bad. Vote for me. Okay. everyone. fill out your ballots. Nice artwork. by the way. What are you talking about? My poster in the elevator? You blacked out my teeth. gave me a mustache. horns. an arrow through the head. - Real mature. - ( laughs ) - What? - All I did was the teeth. You're just afraid you're gonna lose. Why don't you choke down another tainted lemon square? - Flashlight lawyer-liar. - You're a mess. Okay. everyone. attention. Counting the absentee votes. it looks like - 18 for Grace - Yes! - and 18 for Will. - No! What is wrong with you people? I had buttons and posters. and baked goods. That's only 36. - Who didn't vote? - Wait. I didn't vote. - I win! - Wait. wait. you voted. you banana. Mr. Munitz. I forgot. He's in St. Luke's Hospital for a hernia operation. What are we going to do? - Is anybody else hot in here? - Mr. Zamir! I guess we'll just have to wait till he gets out. I guess so. - Get-- move! - Stop it! Telling the nurse you're his daughter. - That's beyond contemptible. - Oh. Rabbi Truman I'm glad you found him. Mr. Munitz? It's me. Grace Adler. I'm running for board president. Why? Good question. "G" is for good government. "R" is for re-decorate the lobby. - "A" is for-- - "A" is for you're being an ass. The man is unconscious. he doesn't want to hear your campaign promises. particularly since I've been doing such a good job for four years. Squeeze my hand if you agree. - ( groans ) - Shh. wait. he's waking up. Mr. Munitz? Hi. hi. you're looking really good. by the way. We need your vote for board president. Who do you want? Will Truman who's served you faithfully for four years? Or Grace Adler. who blames you for the smell in the elevator? Uh. wait. you know what? This just isn't fair. The man is heavily medicated. - and he's in no condition-- - I like Grace. Yes! Yes! I win. you lose I win. I win. you lose You lose. I win. you lose. you lose-- yeah. me! Second verse. same as the first -  I win. you lose - All right. all right. all right. Put your pom-poms down. Tiffany Amber Annoying. - I concede. - Mmm. - You lose. You lose. - Yeah. but I lose. I love losing. - How's it feel? - Not so good. Oh. how the arrogant have fallen. ( mimicking laugh ) Especially when I think about all I'm losing. Like waking up at 5:00 a.m. tomorrow to let the gas guy in. Or next week's meeting with the city building inspector. a man who's never met a clove of garlic he didn't like. Or dealing with any one of 1.000 niggling little problems 24 hours a day. from 36 neurotic tenants. Wait. that doesn't sound very fun. Oh. it's not. And when I think of it that way. suddenly losing feels a whole lot like winning. Thank you. Grace. Thank you for teaching me this valuable lesson. See ya. - ( tenants shouting ) - Quiet. quiet. Quiet! Okay. Iet's just take a breath. Okay? And then speak one at a time. - Thank you. - ( all shouting )   
                




                    			So. Jack. you're still coming with me to pick up my new DVD player. right? Oh my God. is that today? What do I have today? Um What exactly are you looking at? Oh. I'm just going over my schedule. Uh nope. sorry. can't squeeze you in. I mentioned that with DVD you can watch porn from any angle? Oh. Iook my schedule just opened up. Hmm. I wonder what's in the paper today? Let's see. War. famine the computer I bought a month ago is now half the price. and on the front page of the Arts section-- oh my God. it's me! - Let me see. - Will. Will. Will-- buy me a computer. I want one in tangerine to match the shoes you're going to get me later. I think you missed the point of Grace's entrance. Let me see that. Uh "From Warehouse to Our House. the Transformation of a Tribeca Loft." - Get to me. get to me! - Oh. yeah. all right. "Manhattan interior designer Grace Adler. 26--" Must have been a typo. More like a lie-o. Grace. this is great. There's a picture and everything. - Look at that gorgeous face. - Look at the leather pants. Look at those massive jugs. Yeah. what's going on there? What are you talking about? My jugs. Iook exactly like they do in the picture. They definitely don't. No. I mean these are like five times the size. Maybe it was the angle the photograph was taken. You know. King Kong was only eight inches tall. See look. Iet me show you. Here-- and I'm a gay man. so this means nothing. This is how big yours are. see? Whereas the picture gives the illusion of like. this-ness. - You're crazy. - Grace. Iet me see now. I am also a gay man. so this means nothing. Yeah. Will's right. these are definitely smaller. Oh my God. I just got to second with Grace. I guess they do look a little huge-esque. Do me. See how big mine are. - Jack. no. - Come on. you got felt up. Okay. but I'm a straight woman. so this means nothing. Okay. Someone's been working out. Guilty. Hey. hey. Gracie. while you're giving it away over there. you know? - Huh? - Now these are some knockers. Thank you. Okay. this just got weird. ( theme music playing ) Hi. Oh. Iook. it's the dynamic duo. Oh. and Will. So. you've seen the picture? Yeah. honey. what happened there? Oh. Grace. you got a call from a guy. it was about a person. or a place. or a thing. It was something. Okay. that's a start. We know a human being called regarding a noun. Oh. devil. I wrote it down here somewhere. Let's see. what was l-- oh. I was putting on my face when-- oh. there it is. there. John Gregorio called? Oh my God. no way. He's such a fox! Good Lord. a pack of cigs and a pregnancy scare and this could be high school. John Gregorio was high school for me. Even though he wouldn't give me the time of day. Anyway. I heard he's an artist now. he must have-- he must have seen the article and liked what I did with the loft. Yeah. the loft. Gotta be the loft. Hey. the guy is an artist. he was just responding to an aesthetic. Yeah. the aesthetic of your giant hooters. Will is right. honey. Mr. High School called because he thinks you're stacked. Now. if you actually were. you would understand the effect that they have on men. but alas. Mother Nature did not bless you as she did me. Said the woman whose frown lines were filled with ass fat. - Bye bye. - Grace: Bye. - I'm gonna call him. - All right. don't be too chatty. just make your breasts sound big. John? Hi. it's Grace Adler. How are you? It has been a really long time. Yes. yes. that was a loft I did about a month ago. I'm very proud of it. Oh. yes. that was me in the picture. - Bingo. - What? Oh. I would love to. Yes, I know exactly where it is. Okay. ( hangs up phone ) He's part of a group show at the Zellman Gallery. and he invited me. - What? - He thinks you've got big melons. So. if I were you. Grace. I would figure out a way to turn those "honey don'ts" into some "honey do's." Jack. can I get some help here. please? I think I'm gonna bring back paisley. That's so funny that you mentioned paisley because-- do something! I think you're sitting on the remote. - Why is there an earring in your sofa? - It's probably Grace's. It looks just like the skull earring I gave my old boyfriend Walter. Uh-- well. I don't-- It looks like a pretty common skull. I had a "W" engraved on it. you know. for "Walter." Isn't that sweet? Oh. Iook. this one has an "M." J-Jack. it's not what you think. You fooled around with my Walter. Okay. it is what you think. But-- but. Jack! Jack. he wasn't your Walter at the time. You know. I mean. you'd broken up long ago. You know he was-- he was Walter-up-for-grabs. So l-- I grabbed. you know? - How could you? - I-- it was one time. Commandment number one in the Gay Bible: Thou shalt not covet my ex's ass. Jack-- is that from the Book of Gene-sissy? That is so funny. That's it. goodbye. - Jack. Jack? - Sinner! Well. you couldn't be that angry. you barely even slammed the door. Hey. honey. how you makin' out with the fake boobies? This is crazy. I don't need this. Yeah. whatever. honey. just bring out the floatin' fun bags. See? This is ridiculous. I look like a ski resort. Look at you. honey. Look. Iook. Iook. You're all grown up. Oh Leave it to a man to invent a bra filled with water. Come on. everybody in your condition wears them. They make objects appear larger than they really are. Okay. now let's buy that puppy and get the hell out of here. No. no. I don't want this. I don't want lingerie that a gold fish could live in. Look. I feel completely comfortable the way I am. - John likes me for me. - ( Karen laughing ) Oh. honey. I'm tellin' ya. you should do stand up. That's good. Karen. he does. Yeah. okay. Well. then let me ask you one question. Um. did John Gregorio have a girlfriend in high school? Yeah. Judy Lombardozzi. Judy Lombardozzi. Okay. and let me guess. was her nickname. um "Slutty Big Boobs"? No. It was Judy "Lombar-look-at-d'em-dozies." I'll take one in every color. ( elevator bell rings ) Hi. how are you? What? Where have you been? I've been trying to call you all day. Oh. what a coincidence. I've been trying to ignore you all day. That is so funny. And you might want to talk to your wife about the quality of her snacks. There's nothing in her fridge but batteries and mayonnaise. See ya. wouldn't want to be ya. You're stealing food from her now? I'm hurt. - You're hurt? - Jack. come on. give me a break. I left 32 "I'm sorrys" on your answering machine. And even one "I'm saw-wy." Come on. I just shopped at Balducci's. I'll go in. But only to grab a Balance Bar and some chicken. then I've gotta go. - Jack-- - Excuse me. in a rush. I meeting Rory at the Mandy Bar. You remember Rory. Yeah. he's the friend that never slept with any of my boyfriends. Jack. if I'm supposed to stay away from every guy you've ever slept with. that would leave me with women. For your information. Will. Walter was the love of my life. Oh. you've said that about each Backstreet Boy at one time or another. Besides. you guys only went out for what. a month? Yeah. and then he dumped me. You remember what that feels like. huh? It hurts. I had no idea. You never mentioned it. Oh. how often do you talk about Michael? Oh. that's right. all the time. because you're so self-absorbed. But me. I don't wear my heart on my sleeve. Okay. I get it. I screwed up. What-- what is this gonna cost me? Not much. Just a friend. Jack-- I know you're not that angry 'cause you didn't slam the door. Slam the door. Jack. Jack? Oh. I'm so sorry that I'm late. But l-- Hello. kitties. - What's with that? - It's a Hydra Bra. Water-filled for extra perkiness. You would not believe the day I've had. Guys whistling at me. shouting lewd comments. It was fantastic. Sweetie. you don't need those. You're perfect. Yeah. but. you know. I just-- I wanted to look good for John. Hey. all I'm saying is you do what you have to do to make yourself feel a little more attractive. Well. I just want to go on record as saying it is wrong to lie. By the way. I told Jack that Cher is gonna be here tonight. Cher's here. No. No. I just told him that so he'd come here to meet Walter. - Who's Walter? - I told you this-- God. do the boobs make you dumber? I'm gonna go look at myself in the mirror again. Cher? Cher? Cher! Hi! Oh. sorry. Where is she? What's she wearing? Gypsies. tramps and thieves Jack. Jack. Jack. She's not here yet. Now just calm down and have an hors d'oeuvre. Hey. don't get so chummy. I ain't sure I'm liking you yet. Karen. watch. Welcome to my world. honey. And thank you for inviting me. No. but seriously. Karen. I mean. you just-- you really took an interest and I want to tell you how much I appreciate it. Well. Grace. you know. we joke a lot. but when you get right down to it-- - There's John. get lost. - Ahh! Grace Adler. I can't believe it. I'm so glad you came. - Me too. - Wow. Look at you. John Gregorio. Look. I got to go play host for a few minutes. I'll find you. We'll be here. I'll be here. Oh my God. I think he likes me. - Thank you so much. Karen. - Okay. okay. Push me again and you die. Oh. oh wait. honey. I think you're caught on my brooch. Oh. I got it. Okay. there you go. Oh my gosh. his art is amazing. Look at that. Oh my God. - Will. what are you doing? - I think you've sprung a leak. What are you talking about? I haven't been with a woman in some time. but I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to do that. Oh my God. Good Lord. why don't you two get a room? Oh my God. okay. just start walking. okay? Okay. we've got to get out of here before we see-- John! Hi! Hi. Old friend. haven't seen him in a long time. So. John. how's your show? Will. I got this. - Good luck. - Okay. I-- I didn't get a chance to give you a proper hello. Did you get some champagne? No. no. but that's okay. that's okay. Oh. no. you gotta have a glass. It's my opening. Thank you. To old friends. who should have gotten together earlier. What are you doing? Why are you drinking like that? Oh. it's just-- it's just I'm just-- I'm just blown away by your-- by your watercolors. It's just like whoa! - Will you excuse me for just one-- - Wait a second. Why are you trying to get away from me? Okay. John. I'm gonna be honest with you. We live in a deeply patriarchal society. in which women are unfairly judged by-- ugh. My boobies are fake. And broken. I'm wearing the Hydra Bra. Why? Why would you do that? Well. I just-- the picture made me look you know. and I thought that you would maybe like it because. I mean. after all you did go out with Judy Lombardozzi. Judy Lombardozzi had a beautiful soul. Come on. give me a little credit. I mean. Grace. I called you because I thought you were talented and creative. I am talented and creative. Did you see the way that I drank the champagne? I'm sorry. Grace. but I'm looking to be with somebody who's a little more secure and a little less shallow. Hello. You look like you have a beautiful soul. Hey. that's not my soul you're looking at. I think you improved them. You know. they're moodier. I'm glad you like them. 'cause you're getting them for Christmas. - How you feeling? - Mmm. A little deflated. Oh God. what was I thinking? I look fine the way I am. Why didn't you believe me when I said that? Well. 'cause you're too close. You're gay. You're my best friend. You're gay. You love me. - You're gay. - Hey. hey. hey. There was a time when I was a boob man. Of course it ended when my mom switched to formula. Okay. it's 10:00 and no Cher. Unless you can turn back time. I'm very. very angry. Jack. she's not coming. I told you that to get you down here. Hmm. Okay. just give me a minute here. How dare you play the Cher card? And why do I keep falling for it? How dare you? I know. I know. but I've got something that's going to make you even happier. Inconceivable. Fool me once. shame on me. Fool me twice you're thinning on top. Goodbye. Jack. Jack. I tracked down Walter. He's coming here tonight. Shut up. What did he say? He said that he's still single. and he's still living in New York. and he's dying to see you. Shut up. shut up. Oh my God. you're the best friend in the world. And he just walked in. How do I look? Am I swimming in these pants 'cause they're yours. You look fine. Jack. Okay. now go get him and bring him to me. Bring him to-- what is this 1810? - Walter? - Hi. Will. - Hey. - Hey. Jack. sorry I'm late. - Walter. - Wow. you look great. Thank you. so do you. Would you just excuse us. just for a second? - What? - That's Walter? Yeah. the love of your life. Okay. don't get angry at me. but I was totally thinking of somebody else. ( theme music playing )   
                




                    			I'm going to say this because I love you. Your disproportionately large head gives you a marionette-like quality. What do you think of my eyes? Two words. major surgery. The fact that you can see the white the entire way around the eyeball. makes you look a little crazy. And I say that with love. - Puppet head. - Crazy eyes. Ahh! I'm not gonna-- I just can't believe she just-- no! So your mom called? One message from her and I am completely insane. Really? Can you see the white all the way around your eye? Come on. Will. he's right here. Thank you. Lord and Lady Hateful. Now. if you'll excuse me. I'm going to return to a world of polite people with normal-sized heads. Come on. Jack. he's right here. So how many verses did she leave on your machine? ( singing ) I'm coming to town I wanna have lunch with you and Will And I'm bringing Andy Fellner. Another one of her famous fix ups. Can you believe her? Maybe this one will be cute. you know? It's got to be better than the guy she found on "nicejewishchiropractors.com." I doubt it. I went to camp with Andy Fellner. Three years in a row we did the recreation of Noah's Ark. And three years in a row Andy was cast in the role of Woodchuck #2. His one line was. "Ft-ft-ft-ft-ft-ft" Who were you? - Noah's wife. - Oh. very nice. Who'd you sleep with to get that? - Will. I was 11. - Oh. Although I did French kiss Yak #1 behind the canteen. - He was good. - You know what they say. once you go yak. you never go back. ( theme music playing ) Ooh! I want this! Yes! They have it! Cher! ( imitating Cher ) It takes time to move on I need love to feel strong. Cher. I was-- I don't think so. She's so over. right? Love you. Uh. eeny. meeny. miney. Britney! - We met in SoHo. - It was the Village. - Gay pride? - "Wigstock." Ah. yes. I remember it well. - In a cage. - On a box. - Vodka neat? - On the rocks. Ah. yes. I remember it well. - See you around. - Okay. - Oh! Oh! - ( both laugh ) Come on. Jack. We've got to get out-- what are you looking at. Sideburns? Never seen somebody with money and soap? Come on. come on. Break time is over. Karen. I don't want to study anymore. Can't I just wing it tomorrow at lmmigration? No. you have to convince them that you two are a real married couple or this one's gonna be spooning ceviche out of a bucket on a dusty soccer field back in Chimichangaville! Listen. Iady. in my country. I was a schoolteacher. Yeah? Well. in this country. you wash my bras. - Listen. señorita. I could pick up - You better be careful what you say ( overlapping dialogue ) a Brazil nut! Oh. Jack. don't let 'em take my sunshine away. I love my mommy! Grace. what are you doing? You look like that guy on Third Avenue that tried to sell me his toothbrush. I just want to have my speech ready for when my mom gets here. I'm not gonna let her run my life anymore. No more fix ups. Grace Iook. I'm sorry your mother causes you so much pain and embarrassment. but you've got to look at it this way. it's incredibly entertaining for me. Does that help at all? Will. I know you don't understand these things because you have a normal repressed passive-aggressive. panty-wearing mother. But do you think maybe you could be just a teeny bit supportive? Okay. I'm sorry. Support can be beautiful. I'm right here if you need an assist. I feel good. I feel calm. I feel ready. Can we go? Oh. too late. The mothership has landed. -  76 trombones led the big parade - Mom. Mom-- -  With 110 cornets close behind-- - Mom. Mom you do realize that parade is only in your head? Bobbi. you are. as always. a vision. Will. if you were any more delicious. I'd have to spread you on a cracker right here. That was really nice for me. How's my favorite daughter? - Okay. Mom. - She's not really my favorite. I say that to all my girls. - It makes them feel special. - Ah. So. Mom. how's "The Music Man" going? Dad said it opens next week. Well. excuse me. it's "Music Person." I'm starring as Professor Carol Hill. If it's as half as good as your performance as Millie Lohman in Death of a Salesperson I'm so excited about this match. You know. Andy and Grace went to camp together. Will. Yes. I heard. Woodchuck #2. Oh! He was good. Ft-ft-ft! Oh! He's here. He's here. Andy! Look! We're over here. dear. - Hi! - Hello. doll. You remember Grace. - Yeah. hey. Grace. - Andy. - Hi. - This is Will. - Hey. Andy. nice to meet you. - Will. Sit down. sit down. sit down. sit down. So. Iast week. Andy's mother called me and-- Mom. Mom. no. no. I've got to interrupt you 'cause there's something I want to say. And. Andy. believe me. this has absolutely nothing to do with you. "Since the dawn of time. parents and children have woven an uneasy rug with the twin strands of codependence and independence" Move it along. Grace. I'm in my late 40s. Okay. okay. Mom. What I am-- what I'm trying to say to you is that-- Andy. I think you're a really great guy. I think you're a really great girl. - Grace-- - Mom. no. Let me finish. Look. How many times do we have to go through this? I'm sure that Andy is a really great guy. but. but clearly. he's not for me. That's right. Andy's here to meet Will. Oh! Well. ain't that a kick in the head? Will you excuse us a moment? Grace. could I see you over by the chutney bar? - I don't really like chutney. - It's not about the chutney. I am not getting fixed up by your mother. I'm sorry. I know this is so embarrassing for you. but look at it this way. It's incredibly entertaining for me. - I am not doing it. Grace. okay? - That's fine. I totally understand. - But just-- just one thing. - What? - You have to. - What? You'll tell my mom how bad it is. She'll believe you because. well. you didn't come out of her. Don't-- ew-- don't. And then she will finally realize what a bad matchmaker she is. and she will stop fixing me up. - Grace-- - Oh. please. please. please. please. please? Please? Clearly. I'm not gonna win this argument. - Okay. one date. - Thank you. Oh! Besides. I-- I may get to answer - the age-old question. - What's that? "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck?" What are we doing here? I'm missing "Nash Bridges." You made a match between Will and Andy. and the date's almost over. so I just wanted you to be here so you could witness the fruits of your labor. I don't think we should be here. What if they want to come back for a little touchie-nookie-nicky? Mom. can I take you to my therapist? Because he thinks I'm making you up. What do the boys make out to these days? Is it still Judy? What are you smiling at? You really think you have a knack for this. don't you? Even after you set me up with Stanley Fink the mortician. Scott Barkey. who had to touch everything 10 times. then smell it. You could've done a lot worse than Stanley Fink. Mom. he was a mortician. He touched dead people. and then cooked me short ribs. But you know what? Why take my word for it? Why don't we just wait and see what Will has to say? I think then maybe you'll know why I'm smiling. That is one terrific woodchuck. Uh. Rosario. what does Jack's father do? Make people feel bad about who they are. This is no time to be fooling around! Karen. she's right. - Rosario. you'll go in first. - I need some water. Again? What are you. snacking on a saltlick when I'm not looking? Look. Jack. there goes my world. There goes my everything. Stop worrying. She's just a maid. Just a maid? ( gasping ) That's like saying that Pradas are just shoes. or vodka is just a morning beverage. Karen. please. the dramatics. Don't you understand how she-- okay. I am going to tell you something that I've never told anyone. Rosario is my mother. She is not your mother. All right. she's not my mother. But. sweet nectar of the gods. nobody gets the Merlot out of my nylons like that little plantain. - Karen. - She runs the entire house. She alphabetizes my medicine cabinet. - She knows the ins and outs-- - Karen! She's my friend! She's not your friend. Oh my God. she is! Wow! Real feelings. Are you okay? Look. Karen. just leave everything to me. I promise nothing will go wrong. okay? Okay. I'll see Mr. and Mrs. McFarland now. - Oh. - Yes. I remember him well. The last guy I went out with wasn't a fix up. He was more of a fixer-upper. I used to call him "This Old Boyfriend." Hi. Andy. Will. I'm sorry to bother you. My latch. it's stuck. Can you do that trick you do to unstick it? You know. the whack. the bang. and the wiggle-wiggle-waggle? I'm really sorry you had to hear that. - Excuse me. - That's okay. "Whack. bang. wiggle-wiggle"? - It was code. - For what? I'm 12? You sold me out. Grace. go to bed. You've obviously had a very busy day of crazy. No. I don't think so. You were supposed to be proving a point to my mother. not sharing a nice evening with someone. This completely flies in the face of my master plan! Master plan? What are you. "Simon Bar Sinister"? - Grace. I like him. - Well. cut it out! Will. you don't even know him. For your information. he sucked at tetherball. Yeah! Uh-huh! He showered in his underwear. and he once barfed s'mores all over the lodge. But no. Will has to go and find his good side. When did you get to be so spiteful? Guess what. This isn't about you. This is about me. And if you have a problem with that. then it's something you should take up with your pharmacist. I'm going back to my apartment. have a glass of wine. some nice conversation. and if all goes well. a little "whack. bang. wiggle-wiggle." Good night. How could you not know he worked for the INS? Don't they teach you anything in homo school? So what kind of music does your husband like? Well. when he's doing butt-robics. he likes 'N Sync. But for the spinning class. he prefers the oldies. You know. Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Relax. stop doing it. Relax. stop doing it. And where did you two meet? Hmm. Iet me guess. It was Boy Bar. I don't know what you're talking about. It was a blind date and we went to Arby's. Okay. Let's stop pretending. I've gotten farther with your husband than you have. I hope your bags are packed 'cause you're going back to EI Salvador. Oh my God! Honey. they're sending her back! Oh No. they're not. No one's going anywhere! How dare you imply our marriage is a sham! You're gay! What. a guy sleeps with guys. and immediately he's pegged as gay? Let me tell you a little something about the day I met Rosario. I looked over the top of those half glasses into those big brown eyes. and I knew from that moment love had found Jack McFarland. Oh. my cha-cha! Rosario. my love. my life. my all I adore you. You had me at hola. Good Lord. You know you shouldn't look. but there is a certain morbid fascination. isn't there? Sweetie. I believe this is yours. Now. I've seen people desperate to be an American. but that is desperate to be an American. Fine. You passed. See you in six months. We never met. We won! Oh. honey. you were magnificent! And the light is back in my life. Oh. honey. you know. it's funny how-- sometimes you just don't realize how much you might miss something until it's almost gone. Which reminds me. I've got a Chanel suit at the dry cleaners and. boy. did I miss it! Come on. They close in an hour. Move it or lose it! ( whispering ) Muy caliente. Sorry for all these interruptions. I promise Grace will not be coming back. You want to watch some TV. or do you want to save that for two years from now when we have nothing to say to each other? Will. there's something wrong with the door. The chain's on. Well. that's because I couldn't weld it shut. Hello. hello. hello. hello. hello-- ( banging door ) Hey! Hey! Francis! What is the number one rule in the Will and Grace rule book? No white belts? No. Incorrect. It's "God help the sister that comes between me and my mister." You know. even though I am not a superhero. I can still hear you. This is getting a little weird. I think I should just go. No. this'll just take a second. No. Listen. she obviously has a problem. Why don't you figure out what it is and call me tomorrow? From a secure location. Unbelievable. Oh. Don't put this on me. You screwed this up. If you would've just stuck to the master plan-- Stop mentioning the plan. There is no plan! Don't say "master." don't say "plan." All I'm saying is. if you had just told my mother that you hated Andy-- I don't hate Andy. I like Andy. Well. Humphrey Bogart liked lngrid Bergman. but he gave her up for the good of the Resistance. Have you been swinging from power lines? All I'm saying is. if you had just followed the program. formerly known as "The Master Plan." - my mother would stop fixing me up! - Grace. Iet me ask you a question. Has your mother fixed you up the whole time she's been here? - No. - Has she mentioned fixing you up? - No. - Do you get the impression - that a fix up is on the horizon? - No. - Then what's your damage. heather? - My damage? - Yes! Damage! - My damage? My damage is that she stop fixing me up! Yeah. I think that's a discussion between you and your mom. I'm gonna go find Andy. How did you get this nuts? I guess we'll never know. - I made him wait in the lobby! - Thank you! Mom. have you given up on me? Darling. I don't know what you're talking about. Why did you stopped fixing me up? Well. Grace you told me to stop interfering in your life. so I stopped. Mom. I've been saying that ever since you snuck falsies into my band uniform. What's different now? - I listen. - You're a mother. You're not supposed to listen. Then what do you want me to do? I don't want you to fix me up. But I want you to want to fix me up. I just don't want you to want me to want to go out with the guys that you want to fix me up with. You know. this rambling problem comes from your grandmother. Honey. whatever you said. I promise I'll try. - Thanks. Mom. - Oh. the gays are so much easier! I'm so sorry. Well. I'm sorry that-- I didn't do anything wrong. God. you've got me well trained! ( sighs ) Come here. You two feel something when you hug? Anything? Because. Will. if you did. it would make my life so much easier. ( theme music playing )   
                




                    			Psst-- I think I've done it. By adding just a pinch of poblano, I've taken my recipe for Garlic Jazz, brought it south of the border, thereby creating Baja Jazz! Shall we? This must be what bad breath tastes like. Must be all that jazz. Everybody dance now! ( hums ) Woo! Those hips say someone had a good meeting with Harlin today. That song says somebody hasn't been to a club in about 10 years. I just closed the deal for Harlin to buy a cable company, which means, as his attorney, that I am now 10% of rolling in it. Wow, congratulations. And I thought I was having a good day 'cause a "shishlach" vendor hit on me. Grace, this isn't about you. Will and I are rich! I think the first thing you're gonna buy me are colored contacts. I need new eyes for fall. Come on, Jack, you know the old saying-- give Jack a fish, he eats for a day. Teach Jack to fish, he brings home a fisherman. Is it warm in here, or what time is it? Oh my God. - That's not a Folex. - Huh-uh. Oh my God! This is not "kashmere" with a K! No. That's cashmere with a "cash," as in, "I have tons of it!" Okay, Will, you know that I'm happy for you, but remember there is a line between being enthusiastic and being obnoxious. I call that line Richard Simmons. You're right. You're right. I've gotta stay true to myself and not let this go to my head. Speaking of which-- Everybody dance now! (theme music playing) Okay, so I'm at the ATM trying to get 20 bucks to get us some coffee, and it spits out this piece of paper that says, "Funds not available." So I'm like, "I don't think so." And the guy who lives under the envelope table starts giggling at me. Anyway, I stick my card back in, and this time, it eats my card and tells me that I'm thousands of dollars overdrawn. Thousands! So no coffee? No. No coffee. No ATM card. No money. And the worst part of it is the bank has me on video going like this-- "What the?" Oh God. Think. How could this happen? There must be an explanation. Well, now, I just cashed all those little checks you've been giving me. Could that be it? - Your paychecks? - Mmm. You cashed your paychecks? What? Are you insane? I thought we had an understanding-- you don't do any work, and in return, you don't cash your paychecks. Honey, I had to. Stan put me on a budget. Ugh, that word. I guess it was that hat that I bought last week that pushed him over. Wait, Stan got upset because you bought a hat? Well, the hat was in Geneva, and it wasn't really a hat, it was a ski lodge. Oh my God. Oh my God. Okay. Okay, maybe we can help each other out here. How much does Stan want to give you? He actually expects me to live on this. ( Karen sighs ) Karen, I think you can learn to live on this. I mean, Spain does, so Grace, they wear tires on their feet. I wear Manolo Blahniks. Okay, I'll tell you what-- Karen, my friend, you put that money back into my corporate account, and I will teach you how to live on a budget. If this is what it means to live on a budget, then Oh, what the hell. But I'm tellin' you right now, you start throwin' around words Iike Thom McCann and Red Lobster and the deal is off. (telephone ringing) Hey, if I'm not gettin' paid-- - Grace Adler Designs. - Hey, I gotta cancel lunch. Why? What are you gonna buy now, a goat? What? - Why a goat? - It was a joke. I mean, you already have everything else, so the only thing left would be a goat. - That isn't really a joke. - Okay, it was a bad joke, Will. No, I gotta say it isn't a joke at all. It doesn't fit any of the joke criteria. A, it doesn't make sense, and B, there's nothing funny. Okay, we're done. Why are you blowing me off?. - I mean, maybe the word goat-- - Will. Well, I gotta let some clients go, and it may take a while. Why are you doing that? 'Cause of the Harlin thing? Well, yeah. He's 90% of my business now, and I've gotta devote all my energy to him. So you know, time to trim a little fat. And by fat you mean the people who took a chance on you when you were nobody and stuck by you through the good times and bad? Yeah, fat. I think I like you better when you were dissing my goat joke. It wasn't a joke. Good-baa-ah. Will: I've got to let some clients go today, and I figured since you've been fired more than anyone, it kinda makes you an expert. Actually, I've been fired from every job I've ever had. What I figured is, they'd come in and l-- No, no, no, uneducated Rita, no. Not here, you can't do it here. They'll start weeping and wailing, even spitting, and the next thing you know security has to come remove me from the office. - You mean my client. - Yeah, that's what I said. Anyway, here's what you do-- you call them up, ask them what their favorite lunch place is. You're in public, so less chance of a scene. Then you sit 'em down, order 'em a happy meal and can their ass. - ( bell rings ) - Woo! A McFiring. Favorite lunch place-- that's not a bad idea. Yeah, that's how the library did it. And my boss at the Swiss Colony. And Nanna What have you done? Aunt Honey just called me in tears. Hey, I'm not the one that named her Aunt Honey. You should have heard her. "Will won't be my lawyer anymore. I made him a cocoa 'fopurum,' and he drops me like a 'hahachuam'?" A hachoo-what? She was crying so hard I didn't catch the last word. - How could you? - Grace, you knew this was happening. I just don't have time for these kind of people anymore. - "These kind of people"? - Grace, it's just business. When I'm closing a multi-million dollar deal, I can't be fielding calls from a woman who wants to sue Entenmann's because she gained six pounds on their fat-free coffee cake. Okay, I get it now. If they don't bring in the cash, you just get rid of them, willy-nilly. I told you never to call me that. You know, you used to care about people. Now you're just like a bad lawyer joke. Like, "How many lawyers does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Two. One to screw it in, and the other to--" Wait, three. Wait. I mean-- why can't I tell a joke today? I'm sorry that you can't understand it, but this is the way business works. - Not my business. - That's because yourjob is shopping for pillows and tassels. My God, a gay guy could do your job in his sleep. Whoa. You know, just because you are becoming the incarnation of pure evil, does not give you permission to take it out on me. I'm trying to do whatever it takes to make my business go from here to here. Yeah, and as a result, your morality has gone from here to here. Funny, my interest in this conversation just went from here to here! And your lips can go from here to here. (telephone rings ) - Hello. - Hey, Will, it's Harlin. - Hey, Harlin. - Listen, I was wondering if you got any free time tomorrow. I'd like to get together. Harlin, for my number one client, I've got nothing but time. Good, good. What's your favorite lunch place? Harlin, I just don't want to see you make a big mistake. You know I like you, but I've moved on to a different level now. I need someone bigger. It's not personal, it's strictly business. I understand that and I know you said your mind's made up-- - It is. My mind's made up. - Right. Right. But imagine just for a second that it isn't. Well, in order to do that, I would have to use my mind, and my mind's made up. Well, I guess there's no arguing with frontier logic. All right. That's-- that's your decision, and I have to respect it. Thank you, Will. I'm gonna have to send you a copy of "Tuesdays with Morrie." Really makes you grateful for what you have. - See ya, partner. - (dial tone ) We're in the money, we're in the money We got a lot of-- what? How could you let yourself get fired? Ohh! Just breathe, Jack. But where am I to go from here, Will? What's to become of me? I don't think I can handle this anymore. Jack! I'm the one that just lost my biggest client. I'm the one that got fired. Me, remember? Oh, sure. It's always about you, isn't it? What am I supposed to do? Who's gonna pay for my gym membership? I've got parachute pants on layaway. And the food, the food God, I'm giddy from hunger! And another thing-- when you said a gay guy could do my job in his sleep, what I should have said was, I know one gay guy, I don't know how he sleeps. Ha! Finally broke that joke jinx, huh? Run along, Shecky, I've had a bad day. Okay? Aww, Will's had a bad day. What happened? Did you crush someone and they got stuck in your Gucci sandals? Aww! Grace, I'm really not in the mood for this. I don't care, you're gonna listen to me. You know, you may be on top of the world right now, but there is a thing called karma, and one of these days it's gonna come back, and it's gonna bite you on the ass. And when it does, I'm gonna be standing over you singing the "Told you so" song. Oh, how's that go again? Told you so, told you so Told ya, told ya, told ya so. Mother of God, make her stop. Look, all I'm saying, Will, is you better pray that Harlin never leaves you-- - Oh my God, Harlin. - Jack, Jack, Jack! Look, Harlin is not going to leave me. Harlin loves me. Together we're going to make a lot of money. Now, have I introduced you to my door? I hope you're right, Will. 'Cause you know that "Told you so" song? It comes with a special dance. Here's a little preview. Okay, Karen, this is working. By consolidating all your credit cards and turning the remaining one into a travel card, you save on interest and travel expenses. And that works out to a savings of (printer clicking) Voilà! Karen? Oh, that felt good. Oh, boy. Ahh. Where did you go? Oh, all of your yap-yap-yapping about budgets was bringing me down. So I popped into lrnez and told 'em to give me $5,000 worth of anything! Karen, I'm trying to help you. Look, I know-- I know it's scary, but I promise you, once you get into the swing of things, it's actually kind of fun. You know what else is kind of fun? Tuning you out. Okay, then. No one can say you didn't give it a good effort. So, uh - you wanna show me what you got? - Sure. Look at this cute little sweater set. Ohh, isn't this just delicious? Oh gosh, the color is just yummy. Oh my God, and the fabric, it's just-- ( gasps ) You do the budget, or the kid gets it. Ha-- oh! You wouldn't dare! - Oh, wouldn't l? - No! You kill one piece, and the whole ensemble dies. Maybe I'll just start with the label. No, honey, that's the best part! No! ( singing "Jaws" theme ) Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay! What do you want?! What are you talking about?! What are your terms? You sit down for five minutes and go over this budget with me. You're just lucky I let my kids take the pepper spray to school for show and tell. Thattagirl. Okay, let's talk about clothes. You spent thousands of dollars in the Madison Avenue boutiques. Do you know how much you'd save if you just shopped at that outlet mall in Paramus? Hmm. Honey, do you know how many things are wrong with that sentence? - I am serious, I mean it. - No, no, no, no. Huh-uh! If you expect me to shop out of a bin with a bunch of mall-walking blue-hairs in "I Love Grandma" t-shirts, - then you got another thing-- - You know what? This looks like it's my size. I think I'm gonna go try it on. ( screams ) No! Okay. Lordy, Lordy, look at all the freaks. Come on, let's get out of here. There's nothing here I like. Ah, ah, ah, ah, no. You haven't even looked yet. Come on, you gotta get in there and sort through the rack. - The what? - The rack. You heard the expression "off the rack." I know the expression, "Stan, hands off the rack." Bang-bang! Ohh even in the Midwest I'm funny. Come on, Karen, dig in. If you look really hard, you can find some really great-- Okay, this one's got blood on it. Okay, why don't we just move on to the hemoglobin-free zone? - Honey, the fabrics scare me. - Come on. Karen, you gotta get into the spirit of it. I'm mean, I've found some really cute outfits here. I wear them to work, and you tell me how much you hate them. "Honey, what's going on? What's happening? What's all this about?" Honey, what's this? What are you doing? Who's that supposed to be? Come on, we're not leaving till you try something on. Ow. Oh, it's-- oh, honey, honey, can we get a couple of seared ahi salads with honey mustard on the side? - I don't work here. - That wasn't my question, was it? Okay, okay, here we go. Here we go. This is perfect for you. It's your color, it's your size, and it's only $28. - Hmm? - Yeah. That's a great price. Um, would just excuse me for one second, Grace? Stan. Hi, honey, it's me. Yes, I'm at Designer Markdowns in Paramus, uh-huh. Oh, the budget thing's fine, yeah. I'm just about to buy a rhinestone-studded tracksuit. I thought I'd wear it when we go boating with the Bronfmans. Okay. Okay. Bye bye. Stan's sending the helicopter. Budget crisis over. Okay, Grace, buy yourself a little ugly for work tomorrow. I'll be on the roof. - Grace? - Harlin, hi. - Hello. - What are you doing here? Buying something for the missus. See, Harlin, that's what I love about you. No matter how much money you have, you're still humble enough to appreciate a good bargain. Oh, not this piece of crap. I'm buying her the whole damn mall. So, uh how's Will doing? I think you'd know better than anyone. Yeah. Yeah, I do. But don't worry, I'm on him. I'm giving him a really hard time. Whoa, you're a cold-hearted little thing, aren't you? Well, you know, if he's gonna let work get to him like that It's just so unattractive. I mean, even I don't want to be around him. You know, Grace, I don't presume to understand the very modern relationship you two got going, but in the great state of Texas, you'd be considered a bitch. Excuse me? I think a person ought to show more compassion when a friend gets fired. What? - Hi. - Hey. - How was work? - Oh, it was good. It's always good. - Busy? - Oh, you know, you can't imagine. Harlin is working me to the bones. Meetings with investors, conference calls, contracts. At one point, it got so crazy, I said "herewith" when I meant "notwithstanding." I don't know how much longer I can keep up this pace. Will? - Will, I know. - What? - I ran into Harlin today. - Oh? He's still not pulling that practical joke where he pretends like he fired me? Did he? He's so funny with that. - Will-- - Okay. You were right. It came back to bite me in the ass. I'm a jerk, okay? I got too full of myself, I got too hung up on the money. So go ahead, give me the whole thing. The whole "Told you so" song and dance. Not even a "told ya"? Starting over. I'm a little bit scared here. I'm not. - Sit down, I got a joke for you. - Oh, no. Come on, come on! Come on. Come on, sit down. Ready? How many gay lawyers does it take to win a case? - How many? - 37. One to win the case, and 36 to go out to brunch and trash him. Ahh, ahh-- I see a little smile! I see a little smile! That counts. That makes it an official joke! (theme music playing)   
                




                    			- Will: Wow. - Grace: What? It's just so weird, you know? It's exactly four years ago today that I moved into this office, and here I am closing it down. It is weird. It's also wrong. You moved in the height of summer. Remember the window was open, and we thought it smelled like wet wool on a dead man? Ah yes, the new scent by "Decay-NY." - I gotta go. - All right. You seem okay. I am, I think. Seems like something's missing. What is it? Oh, right, my career. Hey, okay, maybe this'll help. No matter how bad you're doing, chances are Jack's doing much worse. Huge promotion! Ow! You crushed my nose. Sorry! lf it's broken, we'll get it fixed. For the second time. I heard that, you bitch. And this nose has never been touched. I'm sorry, ma'am, you can pick up your fries at the next window. Guess what? I've been promoted to captain at my catering company. And tonight I'm supervising an event at the Waldorf-Astoria. I will have eight men under me. How great is that? Eight men? What'd you do, write the Gay Make-A-Wish Foundation? Could you just once reach into that cold black heart of yours and say, "Congratulations, handsome"? Hey, handsome, look around-- I'm closing down my office. I've lost all my clients. So you'll forgive me if I'm not jumping up and down for joy because you've now made head butter curler. FYl, you SOB, cater-waitering is T-U-F F. Oh, tough. Yes, I know. All those years at waiter grad school. The lectures, the all-nighters, all to answer the eternal question that has plagued mankind since the dawn of consciousness-- "Chicken or fish?" Listen, mister, and I use the term loosely-- you couldn't do my job for even one night. Jack, a monkey could do your job, providing he had a tux and a lisp. Then put your money where your mouth is-- I'm short a man tonight. I dare ya to fill in for him. - All right, I'll do it. - Hah! You're afraid because you know you can't hack it. Jack, I just said I'd do it. What just happened? You challenged me and I accepted your challenge. Besides, it sounds like it'll be more fun than sitting at home watching Regis say, "Is that your final answer?" Okay, fine. Be at the Waldorf at 5:00 sharp, and rent a tux. - I have a tux. - No you don't. I borrowed it. (theme music playing) This is one consumer who is not gonna take responsibility for something that is clearly your fault. Karen? Karen! Yeah, I'm up, I'm up! Stan, get off of me! Where am l? Karen, you are at work, it's 10:30 in the morning, and because you seem to believe that fabric can be sent over phone lines, I now owe this guy $150 for a service call. Oh my God. It's 10:30? Honey, why'd you let me sleep so late? I gotta get outta here. There's a needle full of botulism with my forehead's name written all over it. What are you lookin' at, Rogaine failure? Nothing, I'm sorry. Good. Okay. Be back at 4:00-- ish. Wow! Yeah. She usually doesn't come back. - What's it like working with her? - I wouldn't know. Well, I love her. I've seen her movie "Next to Godliness" Iike She's never been in a movie. When I first saw her, I wasn't sure, but then, you know, the voice-- ( laughs ) It's definitely her. You must have her confused with someone else. It happens. People confuse me with Julia Roberts all the time. Why? Well, the hair, the smile, and ( clears throat ) "I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy, asking him to love me." Trust me. That is dead on. Well, trust me, that's her. Just rent "Next to Godliness." You'll find it in the adult section. "Adult"? Adult like Merchant-lvory, or adult like, "Gee, thank God you two plumbers arrived." That one. The napkin fold du jour will be winter cranes-- and mind the beaks! Sidebar, how Madonna is this? - Hey, Jack. - Don't "hey" me! You're late! I'm sorry, but I had to rent a tux and the old guy measuring me had the shakes, so the inseam situation was not pleasant for me. Just get in line. Good news, gentlemen, since Mr. Truman has deigned to grace us with his presence, we now have enough waiters to do ballet service. Ballet service, huh? What does that make you, the nutcracker? Truman, front and center. Ma'am, yes, ma'am! Damn it, when we're being friends, it's fine to treat me like crap, but I will not have you ruining this event and undermining my authority. - Clear? - Okay, okay. Wait. Yes, mm-hmm? Ye-- Ohh! Do I have to do everything around here? Look, I'm breaking in a rookie right now. I don't have time for games. - Jack! - I'm talking to the kitchen-- Get me the thing that this plugs into. - (porn-style music playing) - Karen: This room is a pigsty and you're a dirtypig boy. - Man: But, Mommy-- - Karen: Don't "Mommy" me! Here's what happens to dirtypig boys. (whip cracks ) Oh! Sorry I'm late. Oh God, that sounded insincere. I'm late. Honey, what's going on? What's happening? What's with the TV? Oh, I'm watching what I would call the feel-good movie of my life. Did you rent "Pretty Woman" again? Come on. Give it up, honey. The only thing you two have in common is horse teeth and bad taste in men. - Karen: You're a filthy little piggy! - (whip cracks ) Karen, something you want to tell me? That's not me. Karen: What's going on, honey? What's happening? Why aren't you licking that floor?. Oh, all right, it is me! But it's not what you think! Really? 'Cause I think it's you in a maid's uniform, whipping some old guy in a onesie. Am I wrong? Come on, it's just a little fetish film. Oh my God, how did this thing get into circulation? Oh my God. This is the end of me. I don't think I can go on. - Karen, what are you doing? - No, don't stop me! Karen, don't be ridiculous! There we go, nice and cold. - Oh boy. - Just one question. Yeah. Is dirty little pig boy the other white meat? - Come on, spill it. - Well, I was just out of college, I was broke. It's the oldest story in the world-- boy meets girl, boy wants girl to do dominatrix film. Girl says, "Naked?" Boy says, "Yeah." Girl says, "Forget it." Boy says, "Okay, then just wear this rubber dress and beat the old guy with a scrub brush. Girl says, "How hard?" Yes, that is an old story. No, no, no, no. You don't take that tone with me, no. It's enough that I'm gonna be the laughingstock of Manhattan, but now to have you throwing this in my face and laughing at me like that? No. That's it. I'm outta here. Oh, Karen, come on. I was just making a joke. Oh, yeah? Well, I have a little joke for you-- Knock knock I'm not there. Ready? Spaghetti sauce! And we're moving, we're moving, and pace, pace, pace. And serpentine around the room, and elbows in and show those teeth. Now snake, now snake. Now snake once more. Hey, watch the jazz hips! We aren't doing Starlight Express here. Okay, now, eyes up. Working as one, relevate and release. Very nice. I'm very proud of all of you. Not bad for a rookie, huh? I'm not really looking for new friends. Well, you're not really getting one. Oh my God. It's show time, fellas. Places! All right, we got just a couple of minutes before Abba gets here. Abba? The band? That's all we need is more dancing queens! No, Will, it's spelled differently. There's only one B. ABA. The ABA?! That's the American Bar Association! Oh, good, bartenders are such a fun crowd. No, Jack, the ABA is lawyers! I'm gonna know all these people. Would you relax? No one's gonna recognize you in uniform. Oh, right. This tea towel over my arm changes the way my face looks. - I'm going. - You're not going anywhere. I can't do ballet service with an odd number of men. Then do it with a number of odd men. Oh my God! Look, these people are my colleagues. Do you know how humiliating this is gonna be? Say hello to the hard part. Serving food is easy. Keeping your dignity when peppering Matt Damon's salad is hard. - Why Matt Damon? - He has my career. I see. Goodbye. I know this is a rough time for you, okay? But you've had your success. This is my turn. So you decide. You gonna be a friend or are you going to bail? ( groans ) Huh? Oh. Hors d'oeuvre? Will Truman? - Brian Kelly. ( chuckles ) - What is with the outfit? You look like you should be serving us. And I don't mean papers. Hah-hah! Me, a waiter? Are you kidding? Excuse me, I asked for one crab cake, not a whole tray. So, Brian Kelly. It was funny, just the other day I was thinking Wasn't it? What was it? I was reading a mag-- I'm doing some close-up magic later. Don't tell anybody. Hello? Yeah. What can I do for-- Well, lookoe, lookie loo. ( laughs ) Karen Delaney, right? How long has it been, Age has done nothing to you. Well, it's whacked you in the face with a shovel and left you for dead! You look like hell. Honey, I need a favor. Okay, just to confirm everybody's entrées, there are two steak, two salmon and one big fat chicken. - That'd be me. - Great. - Fresh pepper for you? - That'd be fine, pal. - Terrific. - Ow! - Okay. - How about an apology? I'm really sorry. Not you, Will. I was talking to Dr. Pepper here. Ha ha! I'm so sorry, sir. Fresh pepper for you? - No, thank you. - Okay, very good. Ow. Just tell me how many of those tapes there are and how I get 'em back. Oh yeah, I can get that information just like that. Just let me e-mail headquarters first, all right? Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. ( laughs ) I have no friggin' idea! We made like 50 and sold them to video stores all over Manhattan. All over Man-- you lowlife! Listen, I've built a big life for myself and now it's ruined. I'm sorry, Karen. My bad. How about a little, you know, "kissarooni" for old times' sake, huh? How can you even ask me that, you double-crossing, conniving-- - Oh - You see? See, you couldn't hit me, could you? That's because deep inside of you, the flame of passion is still alive. Now come on, hot stuff. How about that kiss, hmm? You think I would let my bare hand touch that face? God only knows where it's been. - I just left you a message. - No, no. Don't even start. I quit. Why? 'Cause I saw you in one lousy movie? No, Grace, because the balance of power has shifted between us. You used to put me on a pedestal and look at me like I was some kind of a superwoman the epitome of everything that's good and decent and true. Um okay. But now when you look at me, all you're gonna see is the woman in that video-- a bossy, domineering harpy who uses her body to get what she wants. You're right. That is a pretty profound shift. Yeah. So I quit. I'm just gonna clean out my desk and leave. There. I'm outta here. If you need me I'll be in seclusion, suffering in the dark silence of my Park Avenue mansion of shame, shame, shame on me. Karen wait. - You-- you might wanna take this. - What's that? Oh, it's just all 50 copies of "Next to Godliness." Oh, my G-- Honey, how did you? I've been in every sleazy video store in Manhattan. I went into rooms Bob Guccione wouldn't go into without a hazmat suit. I had to weave through icky boxes with titles like "Drive This, Miss Daisy" "Diddler on the Roof' "The Ass Menagerie." - Oh! - So You never have to worry about anyone seeing this again. And I will look at you the same way I always have-- as a spoiled, shrill, gold-digging socialite who would sooner chew off her own foot than do an honest day's work. Oh, honey, I love ya. Okay, honey, that's enough, God! When is your video coming out? Oh, I am starving. What's with these monkeys? Who do I have to sleep with to get my steak? Take your pick. Hey, pepper boy! Where's my dinner? I'm sorry for the delay, sir. We're a little shorthanded this evening. One of my waiters bailed on me because he has a weak constitution and is filled with fear and shame. I don't think I asked for your life story. I just want a piece of meat. Don't we all? I mean, I'm sure you do. Please be patient. Be patient? You coppin' an attitude with me? - Whoa, Brian, take it easy. - No, Will, listen to this guy. This nobody's talking a tone with me. There's no tone. He's just doing his job, which is not easy, by the way. Oh, yeah, it's real hard. He puts rolls in a basket. Good idea, sir. Why don't I get you some more bread? No, no, no, we're not finished here. Hang on a second. - Where the hell is my steak? - All right, that's it. - Take your hands off him! - What's your problem? For one thing, you're creasing my tux. Jack, you don't have to put up with this. - I'm working, so I do. - Yeah, well, I don't. At what point did you decide it was okay to treat people like this? Will, I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to pepper, here. Brian, I got news for ya. I'm a pepper! Excuse me? I'm a pepper, he's a pepper and considering the grades you got in law school, you're a heartbeat away from being a pepper too. Why don't you sit down, shut up and wait for your meat? If the rest of you will excuse me, I have a ballet to perform. Okay, everyone, round 'em up. Smile. Step lively. Relevate. Very good. Very proud. Jack, if I sounded anything like that guy, I'm sorry. Will, letting me keep this tux means never having to say you're sorry. Done. I just wish there was some way I could get back at him. You mean like putting a laxative in his soup? - Oh, that would be so good! - Already done. You are awesome. Don't be so cheery, I put one in yours too. You will not believe the day I had. No, no, no. Whatever it is, I guarantee I can top it. Okay. You open. Cater-waitering for Jack at the Waldorf-Astoria. Good open. But I see your Waldorf and raise you-- hunting for porn all over Manhattan. Running into law school classmates while serving them crab cakes. Getting groped in an adult video store by a former New York City mayor. Enjoying an appetizer of potato, leek and laxative soup. Oh, that's good. I don't know if I can-- oh, oh, oh, oh, what's this? Oh yes, yes, yes-- Karen, actually doing work. No, no, Grace, that's not gonna do it. Let's just go to videotape, shall we? - (porn-style music playing) - Karen: Baby's made a mess. - Dirtypig baby. - (whip cracks ) Oh, I fold. I fold. (theme music playing)   
                




                    			Okay, here's the Thanksgiving menu so far-- apple pie, pumpkin pie, blueberry tart, and ice-cream roll. What am I missing? Cake! We need cake. Did you take a bong hit before you wrote that? Hear ye, hear ye! The holiday shopping season has just begun. Here are your lists. I suggest you surprise me with the things that are in bold. Oh, you know, speaking of surprises-- we're gonna have a special guest for dinner tomorrow. Is this where you try to be funny and tell me that Cher is coming? Well, it's not gonna work this time, okay? But is she? Come on, Jack, Cher hasn't eaten since the '70s. Give you a little hint-- it's someone that you love, but you don't get to see her very often. Okay, I'm thinking Liza, but go on. And she gave birth to you. - Okay - It's your mom, genius. My mo-- how could y-- you're-- rotten! Come on, come on, come on! Hey, woman on the verge, what's going on? I don't have the same relationship with my mother as you do with yours. You never picked out her brassieres? We don't need that, thank you. Jack, she called here looking for you and only mentioned like 30 times that she had no plans. I thought I was doing a good thing. The woman is a monster, and you clearly did this to torture me. I did not! That was just an unexpected bonus, really. Where are you going? I'm going to go uninvite her. Damn you, Otis, I'm taking the stairs! Jack! - What was that? - I know. I don't think I've seen him this upset since they hired a female urologist at the free clinic. Yello! Hot dish coming through and she's carrying a casserole. - Who's that? - Jack's mom. Whew! 86 minutes. - Not bad. - Yeah. Judith, you do realize that Thanksgiving is tomorrow. I'm doing a dry run, Will. I wanted to see how long it would take me to get here while carrying a casserole dish. The other benefit of a dry run is that I power-walk the whole time while clenching my buttocks, like so. You can't tell I'm doing anything, but my ass sure can. Oh. - Like mother, like son. - ( snickers ) You must be Grace. Jack said you were sort of funny. Yes, I am Grace. Jack said I was funny? No, he said you were sort of funny. You're a cutie. I can see why Jack wooed you. I bet you made an adorable couple. Come on, come on, come on! Uh-- whoa! Adorable couple? l Yeah. And I think it's terrific that you and Jack have stayed friends even after he dumped you. Bye-bye. Dumped me? What are you talking about? Jack's a ho-- my God, she has no idea! (theme music playing) Okay, cranberry sauce "Add four cups of cranberries, one cup sugar and orange zest to a heavy stockpot. Bring to a boil. Then simmer and reduce for 45 minutes." - (lid clatters ) - Yeah. That'll happen. Hi, Will. Look, I never got ahold of my mom, so when she gets here, I'm just gonna take her to the Russian Tea Room. Yeah, that way none of us have to deal with the monster. So, I'm gonna need your Amex, and FYl, how about my own card? This is getting a little annoying. The Russian Tea Room? Wow! You'd do that just to save us from the monster? That's the kind of friend I am. I thought it might be because you haven't told your mother you're gay! I don't know what you're talking about. She came here yesterday, Jack. Damn her and her dry runs! You told me you took an oath before God and your mother - that you would never deny who you are. - I lied. You told me some elaborate story about how you came out to her - as a way of avoiding peewee football. - I lied. You forced me to come out to my own mother. You teased me and you pressured me and you even left a copy of "The Sensuous Gay Man" on her washing machine. I lied. I'm a bad man. Now leave me alone with my shame! How could you not tell her? Will, I tried to. I had so many chances, you know-- when she caught GI Joe and Big Jim shacking up in Big Jim's sports camper; when she caught me in bed with Steven and a Dirt Devil. But I don't know, she's not the easiest woman to talk to. She's the most self-involved person I know. The fruit didn't fall far from that tree. Here's a thought-- why don't you try telling her directly, you hypocrite? Stop badgering me with your $10 words! I'm leaving. I can't take any more of this. Hello, lover. Wrong way. Closet's in there. Once you go, Jack, you never go back. All right, fine. I'll do it, okay? Tonight at dinner, I'll tell my mother I'm gay. God, I would think after 30 years, it would be kind of liberating. Oh, no, we're not telling her I'm 30. Hi, honey. What are you doing here? You invited me. Yeah, but I never thought you'd come. I figured you'd be spending the holiday with Stan and the kids. What? No. Honey, your apartment looks good. I like what you've done with the place. Karen, I don't live here anymore and you've been to my new place. Boy, you try to be nice Hmmm. Well, you've come on a good night. Jack's mother is going to be joining us and she doesn't know Jack's gay. How could she not know? What is she, headless? I guess you believe what you choose to believe. One time, Judith caught him in bed with a guy and Jack convinced her that they were doing a school check for lice. Oh. And when she caught him wearing her high heels, he said it was because they helped him with an inner-ear problem. Oh. And he also told her that I am his ex-girlfriend. And she bought that?! ( blows raspberry ) Oh. - Wilma. - Cruella. Jack is in my wardrobe trying to find the perfect coming out-fit. Heard that! I am metaphorically curled up in the fetal position and you continue to kick me about the ear, nose and throat? - How about a little support? - Okay. All right. Jack, this isn't gonna be as hard as you think. On some level, your mother has to know you're gay. - I mean, she has met you, right? - ( laughs ) We're all here for you, okay? Right, Karen? Why wasn't I your girlfriend, queer bait? What?! You told your mother that Grace was your girlfriend! How could you? Karen, I didn't even know you when I made up that lie. Oh, yeah? When you met me, then you should've broken up with her and hooked up with me! You're married. I'm gay. Not in the lie! Excuse me. Eyes on the crisis, okay? If I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna need calm in the room. Okay? Calm. Sum-fun-yung-gai-hung-so-lo Zum-fun-yung-gai-hung-so-lo. What is that? I think it's his Fire lsland mating call. - There. I am now calm. - (knocking on door) - Judith: Hello. - Sarah Jessica Parker! Hide me! It is time for you to grow up. You're gonna open that door be a man and tell your mom you sleep with guys. - Hi, Mom. - Hi, honey. Ah, look at you. - Oh, no, look at you. - Okay, look at me. No, look at me. Oh God, that table setting's exquisite, Iike it's fit for a queen. You gonna take this one, or should l? Will: Before we eat, my family has this tradition where we go around the table and we each say the thing we're most thankful for. But this year, I thought we'd add a tradition-- everybody has to tell a secret about themselves, that they've been too cowardly to reveal. - Jack, why don't you start? - Mmm-- ( mumbles ) Grace, what are you most thankful for? What? Wait. I-- I'm not ready. Wait, give me a second. I want mine to rhyme. - Karen? - Okay. I'm thankful that I found a pharmacologist who's as dumb as a box of hair. And, my secret is-- Jack and I were doing the dirty-dirty while you two were still together! What? Sorry, honey. I guess you just weren't woman enough for him. Oh, yeah. - Jack, back to you. - Mmm, uh-- All right. What am I thankful for? So many things, really the smell ofjasmine-- ( sniffs ) - a kitten's purr - Oh. "In Style" magazine, - Telemundo-- - Jack. I know. I know. My secret is-- there are things you want to say sometimes, but you just never do. You want to say them, but damn it, you just can't. Oh, I'm pretty sure I know what this is all about. - You do? - Uh-huh. He just can't stand you two fighting over him! You are one sharp tack, Judith. Remember that time at Matt Stokes' party, where we met for the first time? And I was in such deep denial about being gay, - I think I was 20 lbs. overweight? - 30. - Maybe 25. - Maybe 35. Anyway, you came up to me. We didn't know each other that well. You pulled me aside and you said, "Aren't you tired yet?" And I was tired. Tired of actually reading "Playboy" for the articles, tired of keeping my Bette Midler albums in Led Zeppelin sleeves. So you took me to clubs and introduced me to people, made me realize what I'd been missing by not being myself and I'm thankful for that. I also taught you how to dance without pointing all the time. And I'm thankful for that. Here's my secret-- I admire you, Jack because you are more yourself than anyone else I have ever known. Will, look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but-- this is different. My mother will fall apart. She's-- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack. Aren't you tired yet? It's gonna be fine. Somebody needs to get back to the gym. Karen, how come you moved in on her man? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. He came on to me, okay? Yeah. He was looking for a real woman, not somebody who just lays there like bibb lettuce. Ah-ah-oh. Bibb lettuce. Judith, that is a lie. This whole thing is a lie. The truth is, is that The truth is after two weeks with her, he came running back to me. - He did not! - Oh, but he did! What were his exact words again? Oh, yes-- "My Harold-and-Maude phase is over." ( Karen gasps ) Oh, I have half a mind to throw this martini right in your face! - Mom? - Jack! Honey, I'm worried, you haven't said a thing about my bangs. They're a little short, but they'll grow in. Mom, uh, I have something I want to say to you. I've kept this from you for a long time and that's wrong, because it makes it seem like I'm ashamed of something I'm not ashamed of. I want you to know who I am because I'm proud of who I am. Mom are you wearing Chloé? Jack! Mom, I'm gay. Oh. Judith, it's okay. So he's gay. He's still the same little boy who gave you highlights for the first time. Honey, I think you're missing the silver lining here. When you're old and in diapers, a gay son will know how to keep you away from chiffon and backlighting. Mom, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this is who I am. You could never disappoint me. I just want you to be happy. Looking back on it, there have been clues. When you were a child, you were overly fond of the nursery rhyme "Rub-A-Dub-Dub, Three Men in a Tub." And you do have a lot of flamboyantly gay friends. I mean, look at Will. No matter what, Jack, you're what I'm most thankful for in the whole world. Then why are you crying? Because I have a secret too. The man you think is your father is not your father. What? My God. This is like watching Gays of Our Lives. Who's my father? Well, it's not exactly clear. Mother, if your explanation doesn't end with the phrase "born in a manger," I'm gonna be violently ill. It was the '60s! I went to this party. Keys were thrown in a bowl, the bowl was thrown in the pool, off came the ponchos, and 9 months later there you were. Oh, okay. Uh I can accept that. So the guy I thought was my dad wasn't. So Jack's gay, huh? Hm. No wonder he went back to you. How you doing there, little buddy? Oh, all right, for the most part. A little weirded out about who my real father is. I just hope when I find him, he doesn't wear a black helmet and speak with the voice of James Earl Jones. "Luke, you're a homo." ( breathes heavily ) Thanks for everything, Grace. Jack, you know I'll always treasure what we had together. All I ask is that when you speak of me later-- and I know that you won't-- please be kind. Get over it, Grace. You already have one gay husband, leave me be. (theme music playing)   
                




                    			Will you're not going to believe what just happened. - Are you watching this? - I've never seen "The Usual Suspects." They're just about to reveal who Keyser Soze is. It's Kevin Spacey. Okay. Listen, coming off the stunning success of I have been asked to play the lead in an employee training video for the Canterville Plate Glass Company. Well, good for you, Jack. What's the video about? It's a hard-hitting look at sexual harassment in the workplace. ( laughing ) I'm sorry, Jack. Sexual harassment? Starring the guy that asked his coworker at Starbucks if he had two nipples for a dime? Which by the way, was the beginning of a fulfilling three-day relationship. - Couldn't you once be happy for me? - Don't you think it's possible that maybe I'm jealous because you've got this great new job and I've been unemployed for a month? - Oh no, are you? - Yeah, right. Hateful. I'm raiding your closet. They said dress like a repressed straight guy. Hey, I need you to help me sue someone. Did the lady at the Korean market call you mister again? You buy one tube of cream bleach and you're mister for the rest of your life. No, but that has nothing to do with this. Okay, I have this client, right? I have a signed contract. I spend a huge chunk of money and then-- - He backed out. - Wow. See? See? This is what I need. Someone who'll show Ben Doucette he can't order a moustache chair - and then back out. - What? It's sort of like a club chair, but the top is curvy-- No, not the chair. Ben Doucette of Doucette & Stein? Yeah, he's some big deal lawyer guy. - You-- you know him? - I know of him. He's a killer. Sweetie, you need a real litigator, not a corporate attorney. Especially one who's spent the last month arguing the case of ass versus sofa cushion. What is this? Do I hear doubt, Mrs. Doubtfire? ( scoffs ) I just-- I don't know if I can do this. I mean, this is Ben Doucette and I'm-- I'm a little rusty. Come on, Little Rusty. You can do this. As Jane Seymour says to her wheelchair-bound husband in every Lifetime movie "I believe in you." Oh my God, I watched two of those today. I'll do it. Hi, Grace. Bye, Grace. Can't talk. In a movie. Just enough time to grab some ice cream and run to acting class. Why don't you just combine them and study with "Uta Hagen" Dazs. - You don't get that, do you? - Not really, no. (theme music playing) All right, he's kept us waiting half an hour. I say we go find him in his office. Listen to you, Mr. "Thing with the boom boom." I love it when you get like that. I've just been thinking, why am I scared of this guy? He's a lawyer. How intimidating can he be? You be in my office in one hour, and be nervous. Hello, I'm Benjamin Doucette. - Will Truman. - I know who you are, - your reputation precedes you. - Your reputation precedes you. And Mr. Truman, my reputation precedes your reputation. Can you believe I said that without a cigar? Let's do this. A cup of proper coffee in a copper coffee cup. Unique New York. Unique New York. Unique New-- Hello, Mr. Dent. - Looking forward to working with you. - Uh-huh. Oh, I've brought you another resume. I've updated my special skills. Um I now know stage combat, banjo, and as of last night I can drive a commuter ferry. - Kind of. - Bad news. We're canceling the shoot. Oh no, no, no. I didn't get a message. I didn't leave a message. The girl dropped out. She got an airborne virus. It's attacking her joints. Mr. Dent, we can't-- we can't cancel. Look, this is my big break, okay? I've already taken ads out in "Variety" congratulating myself. I'm sorry. Unless a girl walks through that door this minute, we're done. Honey when I agreed to drive you to the set, you didn't say it was on Staten lsland. How the hell am I ever going to get the stench of landfill and working class families out of tropical lightweight wool? What are you looking at, eye bags? I'm gonna make a wild guess here and say you two are more than friends but less than lovers. - You're gay and she's straight. - Very good. Now if you guess my weight you get a t-shirt that says, "That's really none of your business." Now what we're looking for is full reimbursement for expenses. So you were two years out of law school when you started your own practice. That's pretty risky considering you were on the partnership track at Getman & D'Onofrio. ( clears throat ) We also seek token amount for compensatory damages. And then you go and steal Harlin Polk right out from under them. Now that I love. That's-- that's theater, man. It's very impressive. We're also looking for interest on the money she laid out. But it must be rough. One minute you're a rising star, and then the next you're sitting at home watching-- I'm guessing Lifetime. And right in the middle of a "Designing Women" marathon, the thought starts to creep in. "Maybe I've lost it. Maybe I never even had it to begin with." What is with you and the nuts?! Are you gonna eat one or what? Don't like eating 'em. Just like crushing 'em. Oh, give me a break. Shouldn't you be stroking a white cat while you say that? - Excuse me? - This is it? This is the famous Ben Doucette intimidation tactic? You crush nuts? That's why I should never meet a legend. It's always disappointing. Like the time I met Big Bird at the lce Capades. Not so big. So unless you're prepared to make me an offer, I'm out of here. Here's your offer. Let me know what you think. It's good to see you again. Ha! - Ha? - Oh, he knows what I meant. - What happened? What happened? - Well - He made us an offer. - Oh! Yes! What's it say? What is it? He offered - me a job. - Yes! What? No! - Wow. - What kind of offer is that? What was he thinking? Why would he do that? ( gasps ) Oh my God. Don't you see? The only reason you were offered a job is so that he can slither out of the lawsuit. Of course, that ruthless bastard offered me a five-year contract, paid vacation, a huge signing bonus, all to make a dispute over slipcovers go away. How could I have been so blind? Why do your people always go to sarcasm first? Okay, so it was a real offer. You're not actually thinking of taking it, are you? Well, let me think about this. I got a job, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba I got a-- Come on. - How could you not be happy for me? - How can I be happy for you? You were on my side and now you're bailing on me. I-- I think that sucks. Would you consider this? That once I'm on the inside, I'll be able to settle this and maybe even get you a lot more money. -  You a job, job, job. -  I got a job, job, job. So it goes line, line, line, do the inappropriate gesture, then freeze and the announcer moves in. Okay? You guys ready? Jack? Jack? I'm sorry, I'm at one with my character right now. So from here on in, could you please refer to me as Mr. Weckerly? Uh no. Good idea, I'll use that. I'll use that. Okay, places. Rolling. And action. Good morning, Mr. Weckerly. I brought you the file for the Hermanschlau meeting. Thank you. Oh, Miss Bartholomew, you have a piece of fuzz on your shoulder. Allow me. Oh! ( laughs ) Cut! Okay, lady, you need to freeze. I was freezing. Oh, you meant-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Excuse me. You're gonna ruin this for me. - What are you doing? - Honey, what are you doing? That tongue of yours could have a career. - It's driving me crazy. - Places. Let's make some magic, people. And action. Good morning, Mr. Weckerly. I brought you the file for the Hermanschlau meeting. Thank you. Oh, Miss Bartholomew, you have a piece of fuzz on your shoulder. Allow me. Okay, stop. What you've just witnessed is an example of inappropriate office behavior. Clearly, this female employee is uncomfortable, and finds her boss's overture unwelcome. Meats and cheeses, you are rockin' my clock, Mary. Cut! Cut! What is going on, people? You're supposed to freeze. I was freezing, I'm working with an amateur. - You freeze or you're out of here. - Okay, God bless you. Let's go again, people. You blow this for me, and so help me God, you'll wake up with Rosario's head in your bed. Then just don't put it all the way in. I'll have to adjust my whole character, but whatever. Dent: Okay, people in theirplaces. Settle, and action. Morning, Weckerly. I brought you the file for the Hermanschlau meeting. Thank you. Oh, Miss Bartholomew, you have a piece of fuzz on your shoulder. Allow me. Okay, stop. What you've just witnessed is an example of inappropriate office behavior. Clearly this female employee is uncomfortable and finds her boss's overture unwelcome. - Sensitivity could effect your-- - Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! You're gonna cut now? Oh, typical man. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. We are gonna do this until we get it right, okay? Have you met my assistant Mrs. Freeman? - No. Mrs. Freeman, nice to meet you. - Mm-hmm. Okay. - What's with the tux? - Well, I'm going to a dinner. They're honoring African-Americans who run big-time law firms in New York City. It's being held in a phone booth on the Upper East Side. ( Will laughs ) Is that the same phone booth where they held the Gays for Buchanan rally? Yes. So what'd you want to see me about? Oh, it's this whole thing with Grace. Oh yes, I am so glad you brought that up. Make it go away, would you? - Okay, you just want me to pay her off?. - No, no, no. I don't want you to pay, no. I want you to take her to arbitration and kick her ass. Hmm. Wrong cufflinks. Murphy's got a good pair. Let's get his. How important is this, really? The amount is only slightly less than you paid for those cufflinks that you just threw into my garbage pail. It's not about the money, Will. I don't lose. And since you're working for me now, you don't lose. But you're putting me in a kind of awkward situation here. - Grace is my friend. - Yeah? Don't you think that's a conflict of interest? Will, do you know how many people I've pissed off by giving you this office? - Have a good night. - But-- I really don't have a choice in this, do l? Huh-uh. - Knock knock. - Hey. Oh my God. Look at this place. Will, I think the only thing that is missing is the orchid I stole from the lobby. Ohh. Ohh. - What's with the face? - Sweetie-- sit down, we need to talk. - Traitor! - Grace, just take my check. I don't want your money. I want his money. Yeah, but he's paying me now, so in a way, this is his money. - I will see you in court. - It's not court, it's arbitration. We'll be in a conference room with an arbitrator there. Then I will see you in a conference room with the arbitrator there. That did not sound as good. What a day, huh? Only 148 takes. My tongue's drier than a Triscuit in an old lady's cupboard, but I think we got it. Mmmm, hah! - You coming to the cast party? - You see that bag of Doritos? - Yeah. - That is the cast party. Well, thank you very much. You've just ruined my chance to ever work with Bob Dent again. Honey, I feel great. Karen, I hate to give notes to fellow actors, but you were really unprofessional today. Couldn't you have contained yourself?. Couldn't you have shown some kind of respect for acting? Couldn't you just-- Chaka Khan, you totally found my G-spot. Oh! Okay, honey, now do me, do me, do me. Okay, that's good. Oh, I like that. - Okay. - Okay, me again, me again. Keep your boobies away, I'm trying to imagine Matt Damon. Hi, you must be Mr. Buhne, arbitrator. Grace Adler, victim. I know you have to remain entirely neutral, but I also know you have to eat. Which is why I have put together a roasted chicken, artichoke salad and some kreplach direct from Flatbush. Ms. Adler, I can have no part in that. Now, would you please sit down so we may begin? I understand. I will just leave it right over here in case you want a nice little nosh. - Grace, where is your lawyer? - I don't need a lawyer because I have right on my side. - But you need someone-- - Excuse me, Your Honor, can you instruct opposing counsel to stop badgering the witness? Grace, you're not a witness, he is not a judge, this is not a trial and you are not a lawyer. I know you are but what am l? Okay, so we're in that headspace. Keep going, keep going. I'm just hiding. My ex-wife's in the building. Every time she sees me, it costs me $10,000. Will? - Shouldn't you be over here? - Oh. Right. All right then, let's begin. I'll give each of you an opportunity to argue your side. Based on the legal merit of those arguments, I will render a decision. Mr. Truman, would you care to begin? According to paragraph three of the contract, any of Ms. Adler's purchases had to be mutually agreed upon by both parties. Ms. Adler made said purchases without the consent of my client therefore he should not be required to pay. Ms. Adler? My choices were gorgeous. Defense rests. Yeah, but they were not mutually agreed upon. Look, my choices were flawless. And if your client can't see that, he is guilty of extremely bad taste. And isn't that the real crime here today? - Gracie, there is no-- - Objection! The familiar cutening of my name implies we like each other. Ms. Adler, though it's clear you know a lot of legal terms, you've yet to use a single one of them properly. - May I approach the bench? - You'd have to build one first. All right, Mr. Truman, I'm going to rule in your favor. - What? - Thank you. - Now if you could just-- - What? No! How could this happen? I mean, this is so unfair. Why should I be out thousands of dollars just because you changed your mind? Okay, maybe I don't know the legal words, but I know the difference between right and wrong and what is wrong is that I worked hard for you. I did good work, and I'm honest, and that obviously doesn't mean anything. Okay, Will, let's wrap this up. Uh ( clears throat ) You know what? I can't do this. Why not? Because I'm on the wrong side of this table. Mr. Truman, outside. I'm sorry, Ben. It's this thing I have-- a conscience. I tried to get rid of it in law school, but it didn't take. I don't think I'm the kind of lawyer you want for this firm. You're wrong. You're exactly what I want. Mrs. Freeman, make sure Grace gets her check. Mm-hmm. What just happened? Underneath it all you're just a big old softie? Underneath it all I'd sell my grandmother down the river if it got me a continuance. But I have me. That's why I need you. Wait, wait, wait. So what, this was just a test? Like this is Willy Wonka and you've just given me the keys to the chocolate factory? Will, you've got your job. But please, don't refer to me as the chocolate factory. - See you tomorrow. - But You know I didn't mean anything by the chocolate factory remark, right? Mm-hmm. - What happened? - You're getting your check. - And I still have my job. - You're kidding! I know. Thank you. I promise you, I will never again ( mimicking ltalian accent ) take sides against the family. Come on, your attorney's buying you lunch. Gracie, am I wrong, or is there some large round object in your pants that is not your ass? Yeah, I didn't think I was going to win, so I stole his bowl. That's the bowl Ben keeps his nuts in. - Okay, puttin' the bowl back. - Oh (theme music playing)   
                




                    			I want this. this and that. I want that too. And I want one of these and this with-- - Do you want this? - I already got some of that. You know what they say about dim sum. "I'll have dim sum and dim some more." ( laughs ) ( snorts ) Why can't life be like this? Why can't they bring around a cart with guys on little plates? You know? That way you could sample a little before you committed to a whole one. "No. this one's too spicy. this one's too mealy." "I'm gonna hate myself in the morning for eating that one." - Okay. what do you guys want? - I'd like a menu. Yeah. we don't actually eat this stuff. You know what? Just some white rice and. uh two forks. Clean. Why do we have to sit with all the weirdos? - Ellen. it's fun. It's family-style. - Yeah. it's family-style. Later the waiters come over and tell you what a disappointment you are to them. You know where you can always get your own table? - The Olive Garden. Yeah. - Oh yeah. In fact. there's one the next exit down from us in Secaucus. Ellen: I know what everyone says about The Olive Garden. but the one in Secaucus is something special. - Tell 'em about the buffalo wings. - Try and stop me. You know how I like food that's spicy but not too spicy? They've got these buffalo wings - Will: They are so boring. - Grace: I know. Grace: Ooh. Cute guy over there checkin' you out. - Will: Where? - Grace: Don't look. primavera. marinara. alfredo. What is this? Oh. that's your rice. It's in a leaf. - Can we go somewhere else? - Uhh sure. I guess. We'll go with you. Uh-- jeez. just a couple of quick bites? Ellen: Okay. Whoa. Lovin' the food. Goodness. We're just-- we're party poopers and we will stay. I have a suggestion you guys go someplace else and you chaps stay here. Then some other night. you can all meet up at your Onion Garden. Okay. Well. thank you very much. Mr. Man. but I think I think we can figure this one out on our own. okay? All right. why don't you two stay and we will meet up some other night at The Olive Garden? - Maybe tomorrow night? - Great. - Okay. Bye. - Will: Bye. So. you guys married? - No. I'm gay. This is my friend. - Pay up. honey. ( theme music playing ) And afterward. Naomi and Kai took us to this underground club that was so cool it didn't even have a name. Just a design. - Like a squiggle and a "pffft." - Yeah. The club formerly known as "Pffft" Squiggle. And afterwards who did I run into in the bathroom? Peter Gabriel. Talk about shocking the monkey. ( sighs ) And Kai. Kai has been arrested with Greenpeace three times. - I want to get arrested. - Both: Go outside in that outfit. Both: Oh. jinx! ( telephone ringing ) Oh-- did you see this? - Grace Adler Designs. - It's me. - Hey, Ellen. - Hi. Hey. I just called to confirm tonight. I should probably give you directions. Right. tonight. Right. - Uh. will you hold on a second? - Sure. It's Rob and Ellen calling about dinner tonight. Oh. no. no. no. no. Naomi and Kai have backstage passes - to Elvis Costello. - What are we going to do? We can't lie. Will's sick. We have to cancel. No. I hope he didn't catch anything from those freaks we left you with last night. Oh. Rob said the funniest thing about them. What was it you said. honey? What was it? Is the circus in town? I laughed. I laughed. Anyway. tell Will that we hope he feels better. - and we'll just try another time. - Okay. Bye. We just lied to our friends. - How does that make you feel? - I'm not going to lie to you. - I'll feel great. - Me too. - Come on. buy me a latte. you big liar. - Okay. Okay. Karen. I'll be back in an hour. Um. answer the-- Who am I kidding? Thank God. Why is she always hanging around here? She does whatever Will does. He would be the alpha cow. So. honey. how would you like to have a little spa day with me on Monday? Jack happy. Jack happy. That's right. we'll do a little mud. a little seaweed. totally detox. Then we'll get plastered and go over to my stepkids' school for a little parent-teacher conference. School? Why don't you take-- and I'm just going to throw this out at you-- their father? Honey. Stan can't make it. He's having some work done on his Mercedes. Or his kidneys. I wasn't really paying attention. Sorry. Kare. no can do. Elementary schools freak me out. Too many bad memories. The name calling. the taunting. the vicious games of "Red Rover. Red Rover. Iet's beat the hell out of Jack." Oh. was poodle not very poo-pular? You have no idea. For little Jack McFarland. or Jack "McFairyland" as I was known. elementary school was a house of pain. Oh. honey. I am so sorry. That must have been rough. And why you? A sweet little boy with sparkly blue eyes and a beautiful smile. Oh. Jack. Little Jack "McFairyland." - Karen-- - McFairy-fu-fu-land. Nah-nah. I'm a girl - Karen. this is not the time-- - Hey. "McFairyland" gimme your lunch money or I'm gonna kick your ass. Ha ha! Ha! ( giggles ) Oh God. Kids can be so cruel. Karen. it wasn't funny. It was a very painful time for me. Listen. face your fears. You're not a kid anymore. you're a big strong man so get over it. Karen. there is no way I'm going over to that-- You just called me a big strong man. Yes. I did. you big strong man. Okay. I'll go. I'm gonna go. big strong man. - There's a bunny. - Stop it! There's my little tickle bunny. Naomi: We should get going. Remember. when we get backstage. if anyone asks. you're press. - Do you guys have a problem lying? - No. I'll just tell them I'm from "Rolling Stone." Will: No. no. I want to be from "Rolling Stone." Tell them you're from-- "Naugahyde Weekly." ( knocks ) See. Iying is only a problem if you get caught. And since we never get caught. there's never a problem. Problem. ( nervous laugh ) Hi. guys. Hey. what's going on? Uh. we brought some soup for Will. Oh. oh oh. this. This is just a whole naughty nurse thing I do for Will. - Makes him feel better when he's sick. - Oh. Oh. but that's so. so nice with the soup. and the so sweet. you guys are the best. Bye. Grace. Grace-- can we come in and see Will? Oh. I would love that. but Will is out like a light. Will: Grace, what's going on out there? Whoop. Iook who's up. Just-- - Hold on just one minute. - Well. should we come in? No. that's not a good idea. It's like germ-a-palooza in there. - I'll get him. - Okay. - Are we ready? - Uh. not quite yet. - Excuse me. - What are you doing? Um. I have to settle a bet with the guy out in the hall. What's the bet? You wouldn't go in the hall wearing a blanket. Are you crazy? We're going to be late for Elvis Cost-- - --hello. - Rob: Hey. Grace said you were sick so we brought you some soup. You guys are so thoughtful. Bye. Oh. oh. oh-- just one second - Can I use your bathroom before we go? - Why? Ellen had two Snapples. Ohh I-- I wouldn't do that. It's-- it's germ-a-palooza in there. Oh my God. that's what I said! You could use my apartment. okay? Ellen and Rob. Rob. why don't you go with her? - Why would I do that? - Because you love her! Come on. buddy. be a man. I do it for Grace. Yeah. sorry. honey I wasn't thinking. - What are we gonna do? - It's no biggie. She'll pee. they'll leave and we'll go to see Elvis Costello. Pump it up When you don't really need it Pump it up until you can't feel it Will! What are you doing? Oh my God. it's gotten worse! - He's got a fever. - Fever. it's a fever! Why were you dancing? It's a boogie fever. So uh. you you guys finished? No. Grace. you're out of toilet paper. I'm gonna use Will's bathroom. really. I won't get sick. No. no. the toilet paper is another one of the boxes. I know exactly where it is. Grace: Rob, are you coming? - Come on. man. get with it. - Rob: Sorry. honey. Will. mate. Iisten. we should really get going. You guys go downstairs and grab a cab. - I'll wait for Grace. - Okay. You're not gonna wear your blankets? Okay. me neither. Ellen: I am not using "The Village Voice. " - What about "Mademoiselle?" - No! Come on. Gwyneth Paltrow's on the cover. No! I am using Will's bathroom. - You can't! - Yes she can. it's fine. - It is? - Sure. Sure. Oh. I guess I should yeah. - ( door shuts ) - Okay. Naomi and Kai are downstairs getting a cab. - Check. - We wait for Rob and Ellen to finish. send them down. wait 30 seconds. we go down. meet Naomi and Kai in the cab. go to the Elvis Costello concert. meet cute guys. Iive long happy lives. - no problem. - Guys-- - Problem. - Naomi has to use the loo. Oh. okay. Since Will already locked up you can use my apartment. Okay. but we're really in a hurry. so go get a cab. - Why can't you get a cab? - Come on. man. I've gotta go with her. - They're gonna need toilet paper. - You get the toilet paper. - You get my jacket. - And I'll be in Scotland afore ye. Laughing on the inside. - Toilet paper's in there-- - Your jacket's in-- - Got your jacket. Get the toilet paper. - Get the elevator. They've got the toilet paper. where's my jacket? - Here. - They get the cab? - We're are. - Elevator? - Elevator's here. - Let's get the cab. - Oh my God. that was close. - Damn we're good. Although ( screaming ) Grace? You want to explain this? Yes. I do Will? Huh? I'm not going to lie to you. These are my doctors. She's an acupuncturist and he's British. No they're not. They're the weirdos from the restaurant. This is a rather awkward moment. Exit "the weirdos" to get a cab. We'll be downstairs. Hurry up. guys. - You guys suck. - How could you lie to us like that? - It's a fine line-- Iying is - We didn't lie. It was just a - We're sorry. - Sorry. How could you do it. Grace? And why don't you try the truth this time? Okay. the truth is that sometimes you guys just don't want to do-- We just wanted to try something a little different. You know-- a little more exciting? Oh. okay. So Will and Grace think we're boring. Come on. Rob. Iet's go. Um. actually honey. I need to go to the-- Let's go. Rob. - We'll take the stairs. - I really need-- Let's go. Rob! While we still have some dignity. ( sighs ) Will you stop fidgeting? What is the matter with you? I thought I could handle being here but it-- it's too much. Oh. I'm having post-traumatic stress disorder. This is my 'Nam. man. Mrs. Walker? Principal Daley is ready to see you now. All right. this shouldn't take long. He'll tell me the fat one set something on fire. I'll buy him a new science wing. and bippity-boppity-boo. - everybody's happy. - Karen. don't leave me alone here. See you soon, "McFairyland. " I-- I can't do this. Give me my backpack. - I don't have it. - Come on. give it. - Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah. - Come on. please. No. This one's better for you. - You can put your makeup in it. - Jack: Hey, hey! Give him his backpack. The purse is mine. This macho bully schoolyard crap is so 1983 I could vomit. Now scram! ( hisses ) What's with that hair? You know you didn't have to do that. I can take care of myself. Oh. I'm sure. I just don't like anybody playing with my purse. - Hi. I'm Jack. - I'm John. Nice to meet you. John. So. um what was that all about? Todd and Curtis don't like me. Yeah. well. Iet me tell you a little something about Todd and Curtis. okay? When they grow up. they're gonna be bloated has-beens with bad shoes and bad marriages. Does that help you? I don't think so. I'm pretty sure they're still gonna take my backpack. Okay. in that case. pull hair. kick them anyplace that's soft and run like hell. I just wish I was better at dodge ball. Then this never would have happened. Dodge ball? Who cares about dodge ball? You ever see that on a resumé? "Special skills-- dodge ball"? It's about as useful as American History. Besides. there's gotta be other things you're good at. right? Well. I just wrote a play for drama class. You're a playwright? I'm a playwright. - I wrote a one-man show. - Shut up. I wrote a one-man show. - What's it about? - I guess it's about me. It doesn't have a title yet. Well. I was thinking maybe. "John's Life." Or "John's Play." Or maybe "Only John." Ever thought about "Just John"? - "Just John"? - No. it's more no jazz hands. it's "Just John." "Just John." It's more from here and there's a pop. It's "Just John." - "Just John." - Yes. Fabulous. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Holy hangover. Batgirl. How fun was last night? So fun. - Naomi and Kai know all the best clubs. - Yeah. Who'd have thought that after 2:00 a.m.. Tiki Donuts becomes a Latino drag-queen bar. I forget is Chocolate Eclairette the name of a donut or one of the performers? Why are you screaming at me? Oh my God. When did I get my nipple pierced? That's your earring. Oh. right. So what time are we hooking up with them tonight? Midnight. It's gonna be wild. - This whole week has been wild. - I know. They're crazy. - They're fantastic. - I hate them. Me too. I've been holding on to these fears since I was like eight years old. you know? And it's just like Dr. Schlemenson says. "Jackie." --he calls me Jackie. which I hate but I'm not getting into that with you. Hello. you're like 10. "Jackie. you must meet your demons. head on." And today. I did it. I did it. Man. I feel good. How are you? Okay. but I think I'm going to be late for my flute lesson. so l-- You called me down to this godforsaken place to tell me my kids made the honor roll? Honey. my time is precious. Call me when one of them gives birth at the prom. What are you lookin' at? - Your shoes. - Hm. They're good. right? Listen Jack. all this maternal crap is making me thirsty. Let's go to The Palm for a couple of "martoonis." You comin'? Um. no. I'm gonna be late for my lesson. Suit yourself. But you'll learn a lot more over martinis at The Palm. Hey. Jack. thanks for your help. Same here. Is it just me. or does The Olive Garden just keep getting better and better? Mmm. Good. So good I'm gonna pay the whole check tonight. - We're not splitting it? - No. ma'am. That makes me so horny. Wow. if I wasn't gay before You sure you want to go through with this? They're friends. Will. come on. You're our oldest. dearest friends ( stammers ) and you deserve better. You do. I don't know what we were thinking 'cause we love you guys. - Okay. we forgive you. - Water under the bridge. guys. - Not quite under the bridge. Rob. - Not so much under. Okay. there are a few things we need to get straight. First of all. no more lies. Okay? I would think that after 15 years of friend Will: This is gonna last awhile, isn't it? - Grace: Oh yeah, but we deserve it. - Will: Mm. - Grace: Ooh, cute guy over there. - Will: Where? Grace: Psych. We're at The Olive Garden, Will.   
                




                    			You're making pancakes. Yes. I am. Heidi. but please don't tell Grandpapa. We had a pact. Four workouts a week. no carbs. no sugar. no fat. I've totally been cheating. So have l. Hook me up. Oh my God! The day I've been waiting for has finally arrived. Congratulations. Jack. I wish you a long. happy life as a woman. Ha ha. that's so funny. I forgot you're fat. I just thought some of us might be interested to know that "Antiques on the Road" is in town. "Antiques on the Road"? You're kidding. No. I just heard from a friend of mine who sleeps with someone at PBS. Oh! They're gonna bring the whole crew. including. guess who? - No. - Yes. - Get out! - Make me. Who? What? Both: Porcelain Paul! Oh my God. he's British and cute. Oh my God. he's gay and he's going to be my lover. Somebody want to tell me what "Antiques on the Road" is? Okay. It's only the best show on television. You know. next to the Creek. - I'm over the Creek. - Me too. So people bring in this stuff and they're appraised by experts. Sometimes it's worth a lot. but that's boring. My favorite part is when someone brings in something that they think is worth millions. and Porcelain Paul tells them that it's worth like $4. And the camera stays on them and their face goes Do the face again. Okay. Now do the face of someone who had something really valuable. and ruined it with Lemon Pledge. All right. okay. okay. Okay. That sounds fun. What time is it on? Uh. not really looking for any Johnny-come-latelies. Oh. please. please. please. can't I be a flouncing geek too? Oh my God. I have to get on the show. because I have to do the face. Oh my God. I have to meet Porcelain Paul! I just know if I can break through that icy British facade. he'll be mine. They lived happily ever after. And that. children. concludes our fairy tale. ( theme music playing ) Good morning. Mrs. Freeman. How are you? You look lovely today. - You don't really like me. do you? - Mm-mm. Mr. Doucette needs to speak with you. - I need to speak with you. Will. - Let me get you a chair. As you know. Will. different firms have different ways of making their new employees feel welcome. Some give you a muffin basket. some give you a briefcase. At Doucette & Stein. we give you one week to make me not regret hiring you. And to do that. you need to bring in a major client. one whose name is on one of those buildings out there. And if you succeed. that's how junior associates become senior associates. - And if I don't? - That's how junior associates become Carl's Jr. associates. - You have till Friday. Will. - Friday. Like in Friday? No. Friday like in Thursday. but I'll give you till Friday. This-- this is a little-- I mean. Iast week. I was the guy you had to have. I was the guy with heart. That was the honeymoon. Will. Honeymoon's over. Good times. though. huh? This strikes me as a tad unfair. Let me tell you a little story. Will. Years ago when I was a young associate. not unlike yourself. I went to a bar one night and there were these two beautiful women. I couldn't decide which one to ask out. so I took a chance and asked them both. Turned out to be one of the best nights of my life. And that relates how? It doesn't. I just love telling that story. One week. Will. Don't waste any more of your time listening to pointless stories. Just wait at table 12. Paul will be there in 10 minutes. Congratulations and welcome to the show. Thank you. very fine. Thank you very much. ( both squeal ) You did it! I can't believe that teapot got us on. What did I tell you? It's perfect. To the untrained. uneducated eye. this may look like an early Why. yes. it does. But to those of us in the know. it's a cheap knockoff I bought at that lesbian thrift shop in the East Village. By the way. what do the girls have against hair-care products? It's their way I've got it. When we go on. I'm gonna come up with some sob story about how much we need the money. That'll make the face really pop. - Oh. that's good. - ( gasping ) That'll help me break through to Paul. This is genius. You'll get to do the face and I'll get to do Paul. Win. win. win. Sneaky. sneaky. sneaky. - Oh. oh. oh. I am so sorry. - That's okay. That's okay. Oh. what is that? ls that a music box? Oh. yes! It's been in my family for years. Oh. I hope it's worth something! I'm sure it's worth a ton. It's not worth a dime. ( scoffs ) No. I understand that. I just want to know if he's happy with his current representation. because if he isn't. our firm is in an excellent position to provide-- I see. Well. when your daddy gets home. have him call me. What's the good word. Tell me things. I'm 5'11". I'm not into games. I like horseback riding. skiing and men who aren't afraid to cry. Okay. you're not in the mood. Ben. I have been trying and trying. but there is no-- Good Lord. that walk from the elevator is gonna give me calf muscles like a Hungarian shot-putter! Karen. this isn't exactly a good time. Yeah? Well. you're with you. honey. That's never a good time. You left these at the office. and Grace and I made a deal. If I brought them over to you. I could leave at 1 :00. Grace doesn't know about the deal. so keep it under your tupe. Ben Doucette. Karen Walker. I know Mrs. Walker. Oh. yeah. I remember you. Stan and I met you at the Whitney opening. You were the bartender! Yeah. No. you just gave me your drink order. Yeah. And I'm still waiting for it. Well. I'm out of here. Oh. honey. will you pop a stamp on this and drop it in the mail for me? I like you. I'm sorry. I didn't know she was coming. She usually sends her flying monkeys. Don't be sorry. We've been chasing Walker lnc. for years. I had no idea you were this close to landing them. Oh. yeah. Oh no. sure. I'm just working on reeling her in. All I need now is a harpoon and a bucket of chum. Will. I don't care if you have to blow her out of the sea with dynamite. Just make it happen. Right. I just-- I need a little more time. Will. did I tell you the story about the two guys who want to go out with you? - No. - They won't if you're fired by Friday. - Hello. Paul Archambeau. - Grace Adler. Just Jack. Okay. we've begun the filming. so please just act natural. So tell me about this lovely teapot. Well. we had a bit of a family tragedy last year. I'm her brother. not her lover. Just-- On Christmas Eve. Grandma Meg Iost both of her legs to diabetes. Oh. And then on Christmas Day. she tragically lost both her feet. So how does the teapot fit into all of this? Well. it's the only thing that survived the fire that Grandma caused when she mistakenly answered the iron. With her hook. Well. Iet's see what we've got here. shall we? Ah yes. well. this appears to be a-- a Meissen teapot. from I would say the early 18th century. It's beautifully done. although the gold in the scrollwork here is a little bit brighter than we usually see on these pieces. Have you any idea how much this is worth? Oh. gosh. I don't know. We were hoping for Grandma's sake. $5.000? Well. I hate to disappoint you. but this is worth $30.000. ( groans ) What? You know what I'm going to do with my money? Buy an Audi. drive by Rory and yell "Loser!" out the window. I can't believe I have $30.000! I can't believe I have $30.000. Jack. this is my teapot. I bought it with my money and my expertise. You thought it was fake. Iesbian ceramic expert. Besides. you wouldn't even be here if it weren't for me. Breaking through to Porcelain Paul was based on an idea by Jack McFarland. - It's mine! - It's mine! - Give it to me! - No. it's mine! Okay. okay. Wait a minute. Look. this is crazy. We're friends. We're in this together. The only mature thing to do. is just to sell it. And split the money. 50-50. Yes. I'm sorry. $15.000 is still a lot of money. Yes. but it won't buy an Audi. Jack! Thanks. Smitty. Mrs. Walker. I hate to be indelicate. but-- Oh. right. right. right-- the tab. Oh. wait. Now. what was our agreement again? One month or $1.000. whichever comes first. Oh. my word. has it been a month already? No. ma'am. Smitty. what's it all about? Oh. wait! I don't give a crap! ( laughing ) ( clears throat ) Karen? No. Karen. it's you. I'm sorry. you must have mistaken me for somebody else. My name is Anastasia Beaverhausen. ( exhales ) Oh. all right. all right. it's me! What in the hell are you doing here? Felt like a drink. And. you know. sometimes you want to go where nobody knows your name. Yeah. well you're not going to like it here. Nobody is going to serve you a drink in a leather thong and a dog collar. Karen. you're so funny. I'm going to need a martini in a Big Gulp. Excuse me! Crazy woman. Hide your teapots. Jack! Jack! Come back here! Jack! Excuse me. did you see a gay guy run through here with a teapot real excited? What am I talking about? It's like asking if you've ever seen a loser at a Renaissance Fair. Can you see me? Yes. Tommy. I can see you. Oh my God. angry lesbians coming at you! Jack! It's really quite lovely. Have you any idea how much it's worth? I don't know. We found it in the attic. A couple hundred? Well. actually. it's worth approximately $25.000. Oh! I believe this is yours. Okay. so. how'd you get that scar? Oh. that one-- I got that one playing hockey. I got burned playing with my cousin's EZ-Bake oven. - Okay. my EZ-Bake oven. - Okay! And what about that one right there near the site of future hair plugs? Um yeah. that's a physical and emotional scar. I-- - You know what? I'd rather not. - Oh. come on! No fair! I showed you where Rosario planted a bite mark on my ankle. All right. I-- ( clears throat ) I sang "I Honestly Love You." Oh! Honey. Olivia Newton-John? No. Yeah. yeah. Totally humiliating. My voice cracked. naturally. and everybody laughed. I ran off stage. and tripped and fell into Stephanie Lieberman's head gear. Oh. Worst day of my life. Not so great for Stephanie. either. Well. get a load of this beauty. Karen. there's no scar. That's just your thigh. Yeah. It's pretty good. right? Look at us! Having cocktails and trading war stories. Gosh. I'm almost on the verge of not disliking you. - I'll keep that one under my tupe. - Oh! Karen. the last time you and I had drinks together. you and Stan were kind of hitting a rough patch. How are things? Well. he has his wing. I have mine. Steady as she goes. Oh. good. I'm glad you're happy. Now. are you and Stan happy with your lawyers? Well. I don't know. I mean. I haven't really thought-- wait a minute. Is that what this is about? You're trying to get Stan as a client! Are you working me. Wilma? All right. I admit it. I'm a little desperate. I have to land a high-profile client by tomorrow. Is there any way you could set up a meeting? This is the meeting. You want anything to do with Walker lnc. you got to go through Mrs. Inc. So. how badly do you want it? Very badly. Badly enough to suck that peanut off the table? - Karen. I'm not gonna-- - Suck it! - There is no-- - Suck it! God. I hope that was a peanut. Okay. what do you say? I say you didn't get on that peanut fast enough. Oh. c'mon. Kar-- what is it going to take? Excuse me. Hello. Ladies and gentlemen. we have a special treat this evening. Yes. the menthol-cool stylings of Mr. Will Truman. Oh. no. no. no. no. Absolutely not. "I Honestly Love You." in a high key. Check. please. Can I get the check? - Want to be my lawyer? - (piano playing ) Then sing me a love song. And make me believe it. Lady. you are out of your mind. If you think I'm going to stand here-- Maybe I hang around here a little more than I should We both know I got somewhere else to go On the piano and put a little Michelle Pfeiffer in it. I got something to tell you I never thought I would But I believe you really ought to know Arch your back and lick your lips. I love you I honestly love you Okay. I'm starting to buy it. Now make him believe it. You don't have to ans-- all right. that's it! I'm done! I am a damn good lawyer and you would be lucky to have me. I don't have to put up with this crap. You're sadistic and bitter and empty. Oh. and by the way. your thigh not so hot. ( gasps ) Goodbye. desk. Goodbye. oddly hanging tonsu. Goodbye. 50-foot Calvin Klein underwear ad. I think I'll miss you most of all. Good morning. Truman. Ooh. hoo. hoo. I had a great night last night. If anybody asks. I was with you. So? Look. Ben. I tried my hardest. I did every-- you have no idea what I've been through. but l-- Please. put all the details in a memo. which I won't read. I stopped by to congratulate you. Karen Walker signed the papers this morning. And for future reference. this is my happy face. Ka-- Karen's here? Hi. honey. Close your mouth. You look like you're missing a chromosome. Good job. Will. Mrs. Walker. always a pleasure. - Anything we can do to help? - Yeah. I'm still waiting on that drink. Something tells me you haven't been waiting. Why did you do it? Oh. I don't know. I like Grace. Grace likes you. Smitty likes me. I like Cutty Sark. That is one polluted stream of consciousness. And I just figured that anyone who'd sing an Olivia Newton-John song for me would be the kind of lawyer who-- oh Lord. honey. don't make me think about it too much. I might change my mind. What's that? You know what I think? I think you're still on the verge of not disliking me. No. no. no. we don't do that. Not on my time. That's a billable smile. Wilma. Karen. wait. About those things I said last night. I'm-- I'm really sorry. What things. honey? Well. when I said-- Maybe I didn't say anything. I didn't think so. So. can your lawyer take you to lunch? Honey. I don't eat with the help. okay? ( theme music playing )   
                




                    			Yes. Intel is up 2.5 points. Yes! My gym just got trampolines. Last night. when Mitch and I were celebrating our half-week-aversary Stan caught us doing a little somethin'-somethin' on his Viking oven. Ooh. Sort of "homo on the range." He was so shocked. I thought he was gonna have a heart attack. What-- what 'd he say? "Excuse me. boys. I think I left my uh-- oh. good night." He ran out so fast. he forgot his snack cakes. Poor guy. came down for a Ding Dong and found a couple of Twinkies. Can l-- can I borrow $600 to pay some bills? No. I had the weirdest dream last night. I was on a beach. dancing with Chow Yun-Fat. Then all of a sudden. he rips his face off. and it's Chow Yun-Fat in a different mood. What do you think that means? I think it means a grown woman should never wear pigtails. Yeah. What's that about. Pippi? You know? I really didn't want to be invited to the bitch brunch. And besides. I ran out of conditioner. It was either this or a turban. - Turban. - Turban. - How about $100? - Not a chance. Oh. I forgot to tell you. keep Sunday night open. Big night. Claire is coming to town. Claire? Oh my God! I finally get to meet the best friend from high school. Oh my God. Claire Danes? That's huge. Yes. Jack. Claire Danes. Did I not mention that 19-year-old Claire Danes is my best friend from high school? Ah. aha. you're bloated. Claire. I mentioned her a thousand times. Claire lives in Paris. works in fashion. She was my Grace before I met Grace. Claire Nope. doesn't ring a bell. Cla. cla. cla-- I don't like her name. though. I'm gonna call her Bettina. "Yay! Bettina's coming to town!" It's much better. You know. I'm gonna have to ask her about your pre-gay days. ( knocking at the door ) What are you talking about? You knew me when I was pre-gay. No. I knew you when you were on the cusp. when you made me go to Chippendale's every Saturday night because you said they made a killer Mai Tai. Speaking of alcohol Honey. what's with this place? You're a lawyer. Why are you living in the projects? I like to be close to my homies at Zabar's. Yeah. they make a smoked sable that is da bomb. By your inflection. I can tell that you think what you're saying is funny but no. Come on. poodle. Iet's go. We're going to that celebrity fashion show at the Four Seasons. I hope E!'ll be there. I want to kmeet Steve Kmetko. - Karen-- - Honey. what's going on here? By the look of this hair. I think this little piggy should stay home. Okay? Karen. what are you doing here? You called in sick this morning. ( forcing cough ) ( theme music playing ) Okay. formalities are over. You're a decorator. I work in fashion. Girls on the go. happiness. blah-blah-blah. When did you know Will was gay? Oh. can we talk about something else. please? No. Well. my first inkling was when he put his hand on my boob and said "Ooh. is this cashmere?" How about you? Okay. Cristina Aguilera or Britney Spears? Who's got the staying power? That was one lame attempt at a subject change. All right. it was after senior prom. We were driving to the beach. Top down. warm night. his feathered hair motionless in the wind. And I make my move. I lean in real close and start kissing him. Yeah. and I panic. I figure I've gotta do something to distract her. so l-- I did the only logical thing. I crashed into a Dodge Dart. You crashed into a car? It was a Dodge Dart. I was doing somebody a favor. It was a confusing time. I didn't know myself till sophomore year. I was playing basketball and Jay Barr and I went up for a rebound. Our stomachs touched. and by the time I came down. I was gay. Oh. you guys. I hate to be a party pooper almost as much as I hate to say "party pooper." - But I'm exhausted. - Will: Mmm. and I feel you are moments away from pulling out the yearbook. - Oh. please. - Give us a little credit. So that's where that's been. - Oh. so great to finally meet you. - Oh. you too. And thanks for taking such great care of him. And thank you for passing the flame to me. so to speak. Hey. what are you doing? Umm. I'm thinking about moving this vase from here to here. D'you think that'll throw off the whole room? Actually. I think what might be throwing off the whole room is all these boxes. You've been here six months already. Decorator. unpack thyself. So? How was the rest of your evening with Claire? - Interesting. - Ah. Will. she is so great. Cool and smart and funny and stylish and feel free to jump in at any point to tell me how great she thought I was. She loved you. Dame Needy. So. what'd you guys talk about? You know. work and high school. How much she wants to have a baby. - Oh. she would make such a great mom. - I think so. too. She asked a friend of hers to donate sperms. so she can have one. - What'd he say? - I said I'd think about it. - What? - ( exhales ) Wow. - I mean. wow! - I know. Big wow. And-- and l-- I've been up all night. thinking about it. and l I think I'm gonna do it. - Really?! - Definitely. I mean. Claire's one of my oldest friends. You said she should make a great mom. - I did say that. - She's not in a relationship. and she wants a baby more than anything. and this is my chance to Iend a helping hand-- Iet me rephrase that. I mean how great would it be to have another another little Will. running around out there? I mean. we love me. right? We do love you. - I'm doing it! - Ooh! Sure. It's easier than giving a kidney. I'd imagine the procedure is much more pleasant. I knew you'd get this. Oh I'm gonna call her right now. I'm so excited! ( door knocking ) - I was just about to call you. - I couldn't wait. - Come in. - So. wow. I really love your place. I really love what you've done with it. - You were just here last night. - I know. I'm nervous. I'm babbling. Help me. - I'll do it. - Really? - You're gonna be a fabulous mom! - Aah! Thank you so much! I feel like I should get you something. I don't know. what do you get somebody for something like this? You need a wallet? It's fine. I'm happy to do it. Now. I don't want to put a lot of pressure on you or anything. but - I leave on Tuesday and I'm blue. - Tuesday? Now I'm blue. What I mean is spring has sprung. The egg's comin' right over the plate. So. if you could go down to this sperm bank on your lunch break Oh. I was really more in the mood for soup and salad. Is this happening too fast? Now. are you okay with this? I was kidding. Oh. I can't tell you what this means to me. - You are such a good friend. - ( door opens ) Do you ever touch men? Jack. this is my friend Claire. French Claire? Parlez-vous français? Ah. Tu parles français. Je n'ai pas sais que tu comprends la langue. Ah. oui. Vaw-vuh-faw. ah. fah-fah-fah-fah. Faw-faw. fav-ah-fav-ah-fav-ah. agh. fav-ah. fo-fah Claire. this is Charlie Brown's French teacher. You are so Euro-fabulous. Love it. Iove it. Iove it more! Quel hottie. I'm guessing you're a high maintenance kind of friend. I cost a little more. but I'm worth it. - I got to go. - All right. Oh. just so you know. your name's Bettina now. It's better. Nescafe? Uh Sanka. Okay. Jack. I need to talk to you and I need you to be someone other than Jack. God. you're like the fourth person who's said that to me today. Imagine that. Sit down. Claire asked me to help her have a baby. Mitch and I have a date. Are you using your apartment tonight? Are you listening to me? She asked me to help her have a baby! I'm a little freaked out here. Of course you're freaked out. You can't just start sleeping with women. Who are you. Anne Heche? Giving the gift of life is a wonderful thing. I myself have put my macho gazpacho out there once or twice. Like. I mean. I've got to do this in like three hours. and and and l-- Look-look-look-look. Bettina's one of our favorite people. We love her. We trust her. and she really wants to have this baby. right? - More than anything. - Women who want kids that badly are the kind of women you want having children. Right? So forget about everything else. You're doing a good thing. I am. - You're right. thank you. - You're welcome. - How about $50? - Forget it. Okay. I have a problem. I don't want your opinion about it. but I do want to tell you what it is. but I don't want your advice on it. because it's always wrong. Okay. Honey. can I comment on those Pilgrim pumps? No. Okay. Will is making the biggest mistake of his life. He has an old high school friend who lives in France. She wants to have a baby. and Will is going to give her his sperm. Now. first of all. Will is not really the kind of guy who could just give something away and not think about it. He gave me his NYU sweatshirt three years ago. and he still stops by at least once a week to say. "How's it doing?" I mean. and dont' get me wrong. I mean. Claire. she's nice. she's great. but wh-- what is it with friends showing up I mean. I don't know about you. but I never wrote in anyone's yearbook. "Don't ever change. and please fill this cup." It's a mistake. He'll regret it. That's all I'm saying. Anyway. thanks for listening. And thank you for keeping your opinion to yourself. Ooh! ( mumbles incoherently ) Ooh! Ho. ho. Mmm Okay! Okay. you can talk now! Thank God. Okay. first of all. the shoes go back on the Mayflower. And second of all. you're just upset because this woman stole your B plan. What? You know what? I don't want to even know what you mean by that. If you want to tell me. I know I can't stop you. Honey. when it comes to potential mates. I This is hard for me to say. but you date losers. Hey. that wasn't so hard. Okay. For your information. I have gone out with some really great Continue. I think that even you know that there's not one of those guys that you would even consider having a kid with. Oh. really? Well. maybe that is because you never met Continue. Come on. Iet's face it. honey. You always thought you'd have Will as a backup. and now your husband's having kids with someone else. And what are the chances he's gonna give it away twice. huh? And even if he does. she'll have gotten the good stuff. It's like a Cabernet. the first batch is always the best. - Oh my God. - Yeah. Wait. that analogy doesn't really link up. Maybe not. but a glass of red wine sounds good right now. Karen. take me to your dentist. I feel my teeth are dull and people are laughing at me. Oh. Jack. that's not why people are laughing. Hey. don't crank on me just 'cause Will's down at the sperm bank on 33rd. unloading the contents of his vas deferens into a Dixie Cup. - That's happening today? - Yeah. Better run. honey. or your B plan'll be kaput by the stroke of one. if you know what I mean. "If you know what I mean." This is where it all happens. huh? Man. if these walls could talk. They'd probably say. "Glad I'm not the floor." Being funny isn't going to get the job done. Come on in. - Here's your cup. - Wow! Great expectations. There are magazines here if you need them and some movies. so. party on. So. you're from around here? Booties and Juggs and Cans. Oh my! If you happen to have an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog out there. we might free up this room a whole lot faster. How about this? Can you use that? "Martha Stewart Living"? Let me explain my people to you. Um. we enjoy. but are not turned on by the perfect scone. Just put the junk in the cup. It's ridiculous. I'm not gonna find anything eh-- "New England Carpenters." Thank you. Lord. Whatever you're doing. stop! What the hell are you doing here? I just thought that you might want to try that new Thai place. - Ju-- get out of here! - Let-- okay. okay. okay. okay. Just-- just one thing. okay? You can't go through with this. - Not with you standing here. - You can't give your sperm to Claire. Because because that sperm is mine. Sorry. but I'm pretty sure the doggone sperm is mine. Yeah. but I took that sperm to movies. I schlepped it through Europe. I bought it a little gel seat for your bike. Yeah. but what are you trying to say? That you want to have a baby with me? No! I don't know! Maybe! I mean I guess I guess l I just want the option. I mean I mean. what happens if l if I never meet anybody? I mean. shouldn't I at least get first dibs? I mean. isn't that one of the privileges of the straight girl-gay guy relationship? Shouldn't you be my fallback sperm? Look. Iet me get this straight. You would sacrifice Claire's happiness just on the off chance that one day-- in the distant future. you might. just maybe. need to call upon my little guys in top hats? Yes. And the fact that I might feel good about helping a friend. doesn't even factor into your thought process? - Yes. - And that this is about my life. meaning not your life. and Claire's life. again not your life. is meaningless to you? Um yes. Look. you were the one who always said that every feeling is valid and I should share it with you. - And-- and I would like to amend that. - To what? To "You selfish lunatic. get out of my spermatorium." - Hi. - Hi. About this afternoon. I am sorry. It's your life. You do what you want. It's not my place to say-- - I couldn't do it. - Oh. my. thank God. I mean. what happened? I just kept thinking about you. - Um. thanks. - No! I meant-- I I kept thinking of what you said about me being your fallback sperm. - Just as an option. - You're not going to need the option. You're fantastic. and you're gonna meet someone fantastic. and you're gonna have a million babies of your own. Yeah. I guess. But what did happen. and why didn't-- why didn't you do it? Well. because you're my fallback egg. Sweetie. you're not gonna need me. You're fantastic. and you're gonna meet someone fantastic and you're gonna have a million babies of y-- wait a minute. What am I saying? - You're totally gonna need me. - Oh. yeah. I'm not going to the gym just to wind up with stretch marks. I tell you that. I told Claire. that-- you know. that if I ever have a baby I want it to be with you. I mean. if there's gonna be a little Will running around out there. I want him to be a little Will and a little Grace. - Really? - Little Grace. Oh my God. that is so sweet. - The two of us having a kid! - I know. And Derek. my boyfriend. - Derek. Have I met him? - Neither one of us has. - He's a carpenter in New England. - Ah! ( theme music playing )   
                




                    			Will. you asleep? Will! Oh. I'm sorry. did I wake you? Oh. it's okay. I had to get up anyway. 'cause there was someone at my bedroom door screaming "Will." I'm so sorry. I just-- I couldn't sleep. I have this presentation tomorrow and l-- you know what? Now that-- now that I've woken you up. you look tired. - Go back to sleep. - Oh. come here! You always get nuts before something like this. and you're always great. They're going to love it. How come you always know exactly the right thing to say? 'Cause I'm incredibly sensitive. and because you had the exact same problem last week. ( screams ) ( theme music playing ) Could you-- just pour the milk? It's cereal. not dynamite! I don't want it to get too soggy. I hate when they go "snap. crackle. poop." Hey. panic mode. Clear a path. My 10:00 was moved to 9:00. so I only have like three minutes to eat. Thanks. Isn't it great how sugar has no fat in it? Now. Grace. if you want to lose weight. try my diet. Whenever I want to eat. I've a friend come over and steal my food. Jack and Grace: He's talking about you. Oh. I gotta run. I'm late. I've got like nine bites left. so I'll just leave the bowl with the doorman. What was that about. Flinchy? What do you mean? You flinched. Flinchy. Psst. Wifey tried to give you a smooch and you flinched. What's the matter. Flinchy? - Trouble in paradise? - No. Do you ever have dreams about women? - Sure. Bette. Barbra. Liza. - No, no. I mean sex dreams. Uh. no. And why would you? You mean Grace? She doesn't even have an album. It's only been a couple of weeks. but it's-- - it's kind of got me weirded out. - Weirded out? Hi. try disgusted. Oh. God! lpecac. I need ipecac. You know. what frightens me. Jack. is that I'm the only person in the world who knows that this is you helping. Just give me a minute to get the image out of my head. all right? Ricky Martin in gauchos. Ricky Martin in gauchos. Away. That was easy. Well. once again. you've helped me navigate the tricky rapids of my life. and I thank you. And I do take full responsibility. You're in love with me. you can't have me. you're fat. ergo Grace. It all lines up perfectly. Please. I want you to seek professional help. Professional he-- hey. that's the pot calling the kettle taupe. You mean a therapist? I don't need a therapist. Fine. Live in denial. I tell you. I've seen a lot of sick male-female relationships in my time. but yours. my friend. is by far the sickest. Now. if you'll excuse me. I have to go get my wife some bunion cream. I do not need a therapist. ( moans ) ( screams ) So. in the dream. how do you feel? I feel like I'm having sex with a woman. And as a gay man Iet's just say there were things there that I wish weren't there and one thing that isn't there that I really kind of miss. Is that your last patient? Look. I wouldn't take these dreams literally. - It's probably not about sex at all. - Really? Naked bodies entwined. nails clawing my back? You know. I get Showtime. That's sex. What I mean is. most dreams are metaphorical. They almost always represent some other underlying problem. In this case. maybe a problem with Grace. - So it's not really about sex at all? - Not likely. Oh. that's good. Starting to think I was going a little woo-hoo. That's probably not the technical term. No. I believe the technical term is neuro-ebhr-br-br-br disorder. So. tell me. what's going on in your life? Is there something that feels out of balance. or maybe you're conflicted about something? I don't think so. Maybe I am. No. I'm not. Yes. you are. What do you know? Shut up. No. you shut up. Papa can you hear me? Sorry. Went a little mental with Yentl. That's-- that-- that's a rhyming game that Grace and l-- forget it. You'd have to know her. Well. on that topic. how do you feel about bringing Grace into this discussion? Sure. What do you want to know about her? No. I mean here in the room. A session with both of you. You're bored with me. aren't you? The magic is gone. No. I think I might just get a better understanding of what your dynamic is together. I do this with a number of my patients. But I don't want to talk about the dreams. I wouldn't want to talk to anyone I was having sex dreams about. Although. I don't actually know Stone Phillips. This is your journey. Grace doesn't have to know. I don't think I'm really comfortable with that. It's your choice. However. you should know. unless you get to the root of these dreams. they're probably gonna become more frequent. Wednesday morning good for you? Oh. Cha-Cha. that's good. - Hi. Poodle. - Who's your daddy? You are. Okay. come on. Rosario. up. up-up-up-up. I need you to whip up a batch of cosmos. The Bronfmans came back from the party with us. and I don't like 'em when they're sober. Why don't I just squeeze you like a sponge? There's enough alcohol in you to fill a hot tub. Okay. up. up. up-up-up-up. Up. Karen. you can't work her that hard. She's been on her feet all day. Oh my God. I'm so Norma Rae. Leave her alone. Oh. well. Iook at you. Sticking up for your Mexican mama. Huh. you like that? I told you. Iady. I'm from EI Salvador. Blah. blah. Shift it! Come on! Karen. she's not going. Excuse me? Mink trumps felt. Okay? Okay? It's okay. Cha-Cha. I don't mind. Hmm? Lady. tonight you better sleep with one eye open. Honey. I haven't slept since 1972. but thank you! Listen to me. As Rosario's legally endowed husband. I am putting my foot down. You'd better start treating her with some respect or else. Jack. Iet me paint you a little picture of life here at Chez Walker. You may want to sit down for this. Nobody matters but me. Good night. So. Grace. did Will tell you why you're here? No. not exactly. I mean. he said he was anxious and can't sleep. So. what. is he anxious because of me? Is that the point to all of this? No. This is really about Will. By seeing your dynamic first hand. I can gain some insight into Will and Will's issues. - Okay? - Mm-hmm. So with that in mind. Iet's talk about Will. But every time I try to get close to my sister. she just-- she hits me with all of this rage. I mean. Iike-- Iike it-- Iike it's my fault she was a binge eater. Like it's my fault that my mother made her wear ankle weights to vacuum the living room. Grace. you were in no way responsible for-- for her slow metabolism or her epic ass. You're right. Thank you. Actually. I feel a little better. Whoa. I've so got to run. Am I allowed to-- to end the session. or is that something you're supposed to do? I have control issues. We'll talk about that next time! If I say we talk about it. I'll see you at home. I have to make a call. Okay. Thanks. Doc. - Do you mind if I use your phone? - Help yourself. ( cell phone ringing ) Hello. Hello? Oh. good. it works. Okay-- I'm expecting a really important call and my phone sucks. So l-- Bye. Call me. You must think I'm a little woo-hoo. Actually. I think you're adorable. I never thought I would like therapy. you know. 'cause I don't know. I've always hated Dr. Laura. But it's great. You know. it's like a talk show and I'm the only guest. I'm always in the hot seat. I never have to move to the end of the couch. Except for that time that Joan Embry showed up with a spider monkey. - ( Karen laughs ) - See? Proof it's working. I'm actually connecting with Karen. Minnie Driver. who ever told you you could pull off a leather jumpsuit? So. you never told me. My therapist. do you like him? Sure. Sure. I like him. Why wouldn't I like him? I mean. I like him like I like the Statue of Liberty. I'm glad it's there but I don't need to see it all the time. Interesting analogy. Which reminds me. Get out. already. So you-- you want to grab a little ltalian tonight? Maybe even have dinner first? I can't. I already have plans. You little minx. Third time this week. You know me. Adios. amiga. You gonna tell me who the mystery man is? Um. You know. it's-- it's still early. I don't want to jinx it if that's okay. All right. I can respect that. Karen. always a joy. Ieaving you. Okay. Karen. I need you to fax this over to-- So you're boinking the head doctor. aren't you? No. I know that you always like to think that you are right. but I am not boinking the head doctor. But there has been a little over-the-sweater action. Oh my God. How did you? Was your mother a jackal. by any chance? Oh. honey. come on! I always know when you're getting a little - How? - Honey. it's in my bones. The same way that I know that that outfit is a fiesta del failure. I mean. what was I supposed to do? I just stayed after the session to use the phone. smiles were exchanged. he called me "adorable." and the next thing I know. my phone number ended up on his palm. Among other things. Okay. okay. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking it is wrong and inappropriate to go out with Will's therapist. But consider this-- I'm not gonna sleep with him. Even though he's dying to. Because that would be inappropriate. Even though he's dying to. But I'm not gonna do it. Even though he's dying to. Not gonna. Dying to. Oh. honey. what it must be like to live inside that head. - Hi. Poodle. - Mm. how are you? Hi. Grace. Who's your daddy? His name is Martin Adler. You're so funny and pretty. I don't tell you that enough. do l? No. - Blouse? - Loehmann's. - Shoes? - Nine West. Fabulous. Wait a minute. What the hell is going on here? Hey. take Jackie to Blimpie's. Come on. I'm sorry. As much as I would love a huge salami hoagie at 10:45 in the morning. I can't. I'll take you to lunch. honey. You should've thought of that when you woke Rosario up at 5:00 a.m. this morning to coat Stan with Tinactin. Oh. oh. come on. Jack. No! Rosario made your bed. now lie in it. So then my-- my mom gets on the line. and my dad totally shuts down. and in a flash. I'm back in their house again. I'm 16 years old. Did you have this sex dream about Grace again last night? Uh. yeah. Yeah. So-so-so-so anyway. my mom and I get into it. and finally. for the first time in my life. I was able to say. "Would you please just let the man speak?!" That's good. I think that's-- that's good. I wonder if it's something you're doing to get her into bed. I mean. You know. in the dream? I th-- I thought we were talking about my parents. You're avoiding the issue. I want to know what you did to get Grace into bed. In-- in the dream. I didn't do anything. She was just there. Fine. then let's broaden the scope. What does one do to get Grace into bed? What? How is that relevant? Because if you're doing things that are similar to what other men have done to get her into bed. aren't you in some way culpable? Are you saying. that I want to sleep with Grace? All I'm saying is. in the dream. are you doing the things other men do to get Grace into bed? - Like what? - You tell me! What do other men do to get her into bed? I mean. what does it take? I don't know. A nice dinner. flowers? - No! - I beg your pardon? I mean. I mean. no. no. I think you're missing the central issue here. That wasn't a "No. you're missing the central issue." that's a "No. I ain't getting any." You're having sex with Grace! Of this I am certain-- I am not having sex with Grace. Even if sex includes a little over-the-sweater action? - If you're gonna cast that wide a net-- - You scum! You're angry with me. Good. But wasn't it Grace that came into your therapy session and turned it into a dating service? Yeah. with you. This is about you. not Grace. She's doing what she always does. making every situation about her. - That's why you're having those dreams. - No. Yes. What? Really? Yes. in the dream. her needs are being met. Mine aren't. If they were. it wouldn't be Grace in bed with me. it would be Stone Phillips. Iike it used to be. You can ring my bell -  Ring my bell -  Ding dong Ring-a-ling-a-ling. Hi. honey. how is your day going? Same old. same old. Uh. what are you ironing? Those are real pretty. They're your napkins. Well. they're just beautiful. Uh. so. Iisten. Rosario. I've been thinking. you know. maybe we should do more stuff together. I don't drink. Uh. well. then how's abouts we go down to Niketown and pick you up a kicky new pair of fun. huh? - Just us girls. come on. - Lady. you're giving me the creeps. What's going on here? Listen. Rosie. Iet me explain. ( clears throat ) Esta mañana. Señora Boozehound y yo. - vamos a la playa para-- - In English. If you prefer. We had a little talk. and Karen has decided that from now on. she's gonna treat you. my wild Latin rose. Iike a decent human being. - Is that true? - Yeah. honey. Then I quit. Karen and Jack: What?! I didn't sign on to work for a decent human being. I signed on to work with Miss Karen. You ungrateful little ( both shouting ) Oh. honey. it's good to be back. Oh. don't ever leave me. cupcake. Well. I guess everybody's happy. Sorry to throw you off. I forgot that even though harsh words are exchanged sometimes. underneath it all is love. Hmm. - I totally had you going there. - You kill me. chica. Both: Whoa! - Who's your daddy? - You are. Okay. this has been driving me crazy. and I can't keep it in any longer. There's something I really need to tell you. - I have been dating your shrink. - Dating my shrink. How did you know? Well. Iet's just say he's used my sessions to figure out a way to get into Graceland. Very fun for me at 150 bucks an hour. Oh! I am so sorry! I am terrible. - There is no defense. - None. But if there was. it would be that I only went out with him a few times. I never slept with him. and I'm gonna stop seeing him because the guilt has been killing me. Grace. Grace. Grace. Grace-- I don't want to talk about you. I don't want to talk about my therapist. I'd like to talk about me. Can we just make this about me. for once? What do you mean "for once"? You have a way of making every situation about you. - I do not. - Oh. really? Item-- Iast month when I had bronchitis. you made me do an herbal steam. We ended up in the emergency room because you thought you were allergic to eucalyptus. My feet were swollen to the size of canoes. Stop trying to squeeze into a size six. European sizes run big! Item-- you take my cereal and make it your cereal. I have blood sugar issues. Try food shopping. Item-- you're dating my shrink! I-- I-- oh my God. I do that. I did that. Oh my God. I'm horrible! I've got to start going to a therapist to figure out why I do this. - You're doing it again. - Oh my God. I am. Oh. I am. Oh. bad. Bad. bad. bad. bad. bad. bad. Oh. come on. Frances. - I am awful. - Yes. you are sometimes. But your obsessive devotion to your own neurotic needs is part of what makes you wonderful. - Really? - Yes. All I'm asking is that once in a while you check in with me. Okay. I will. - How was your day? - You don't have to start now. No. No. I really want to know. Okay. well. the-- - the cute deli guy at Balducci's - Mm-hmm. gave me extra ham. which. as we all know. is food-service-guy code for "I dig ya." Got a great seat on the subway. work was good. and now I'm just looking forward to a full night's sleep without the dreams. What dreams? I'm sick of talking about me. Let's talk about you. ( moaning ) ( screams ) Oh. sweetie. not agai-- Come on in. Stone. ( theme music playing )   
                




                    			Oh. my dad's here. my dad's here. He's just parking his rental car. Got a spot on 78th. Very impressive. Look at him. He's such a cute little parallel parker. Oh. there's the door. Oh. he's getting out of the car. Oh. he Asian. Okay. that's not my dad. Look at you. Mr. Happy Boots. I wish I got this excited when my dad came to visit me. - Come on. your dad's great. - Yeah. in a parallel universe where my hair is straight and so are you. How about that time you got into Columbia and he threw you a big party? That was your dad. When I told my dad I got into Columbia. he said. "Yeah. well we're broke. Now move. you're blocking 'Baretta'." Ah. fathers. Yeah. Mine withheld affection from me for 30 years. Then I find out he's not really my father and my whole life has been a big lie. I'm sorry did I bring everybody down? Jack. I don't know what to say. except-- - ( knocks ) - My dad's here. yeah! - Will. - Pop! - Hey-- - Give me that coat. come on. - Look at you. you look great. - Thank you. - That my sweater? - No. Grandma sent this to me - Iast Christmas. - She took it from me. The woman's gettin' old. Will. I'm tellin' you. she's gettin' old. - Hello. beautiful. - Hello. George. Hey. you workin' out? Oh. you know. when I can fit it in. Twice a day. six days a week. And who looks more like Rita Hayworth every day. huh? Oh. George. you're gonna spoil me. - The other Rita Hayworth. - Will: Come here. - Oh. my father is so bad. - Good to see you. sweetheart. I'm never giving my father another Father's Day present ever again. Ever. Grace. don't Bogart the dad. huh? - You want something to eat? - No. no. don't bother. I'm not hungry. Unless you got. maybe Iike a sandwich. - Make that two. - Yeah. you know. don't bother. - I'll nibble. - I'll still have mine. Sure. Jack. how about a fat chance on rye? Oh. I almost forgot. Here. - Oh. Dad-- - It's nothing. it's a little something. - Absolutely nothing. - Ah! - I saw it. it seemed like you. - Oh Only smaller and flatter and fuzzier. I love it. thank you. The only thing my dad ever gave me was feet the size of canoes. Hey. don't get too attached to that. I have a coat of yours that would go perfect with it. - Well. I must away. - Got a hot date. Jackie? No. but the guy who's dating me does. See. I keep telling you. Iearn from this man. Follow him around. Do what he does. Yeah. I'm sure you'd be very happy to see me dancing on a box in a sequined tube top. George. if you ever get tired of him. you'll be exactly like me. Chow mein. So. George. why are you in town? Well. the company's giving me an award for. uh I don't know. workin' there and not dyin'. An award? You said it was just a business dinner. - I wanna come. - No. no. no. don't come. nobody's coming. Your brothers are busy. Mom's taking care of Grandma. nobody's coming. - Are the Burtons coming? - Yeah. - B.J. and Chuck? - Yeah. - Buzz and Rita and Sherman-- - Yeah. yeah. yeah. nobody's coming. Well. I wanna come. Don't be silly. it's already becoming a thing. and I don't want it to blow up into a situation. Now. if you'll excuse me. I gotta go to the john. See that? It's classic George Truman. He says he doesn't want me to come. but what he means is. "I want you to come. I just don't want to put you out." Well. my father's never invited me anywhere. Except the time he had that lower G.I. series. Don't think Norman Rockwell's gonna be paintin' that one. No. no. Hey-- we should go. you know. and surprise him. Yes. yes. We can go and we can hide under the table. and when they say his name. we can jump up and go. "Surprise!" Yeah. and then Harpo and Zeppo could bring in the dean's wife and we'll all sail to Freedonia. Hey. don't knock it. It was very funny when we did it in my dad's G.I. series. ( theme music playing ) Hi. poodle. - Who's your daddy? - You are. Who's my daddy? Oh. that's right. some stranger in a Nixon mask who boinked my mother at a pool party in '68. God. that is awful. Who in the world would have a pool party? I don't know. it's just seeing Will with his dad. It feels like there's something missing in my life. you know? Like my soul is on empty. You can go a lot of years on empty. honey. Trust me. Come on. Charge yourself a little happy. No. Karen. Buying something's not gonna make me feel any better. Although the new Prada slip-on wouldn't make me feel any worse. Hey. Jack. How you doin'? Sad. Ionely. fatherless. Seconds away from recording a Country album. Karen. why are you laughing? - He's in pain. - Oh, I know. He's miserable. He doesn't know who his real father is. it's terrible. Oh. oh. oh. wait a minute. I get the joke. Jack's all alone in the world. Funny. No. no. honey. you don't understand. I found him. - I found Jack's daddy. I did. - What? Yeah. I had Private Detective do a little snooping around. He was getting bored following Stan back and forth to Krispy Kreme anyway. so - And it paid off. - Wait a minute. you found Jack's father? Why didn't you tell him? Well. honey. I'm working on a set-up here. Tonight. Jack is gonna meet his real daddy. Again. why didn't you tell him? I know this may be an alien concept to you. but it might have made another person happy. Lord. you are just as simple as that blouse you're wearing. I am trying to create a moment here. - Right. So tell him that-- - I'm still talking. - All I'm saying is-- - Quit interrupting me. - Don't yell at me. - I'm not yelling. ( yells ) Yes you are! God. honey. I was just trying to tell you a little story. Go. Right now. they're both in the dark. However. I am going to call them both and have them meet tonight at Jack's favorite coffee shop-- very mysterious. very. "Who am I meeting?" okay? And then. I am going to arrive to make the big announcement. "Jack. there's a daddy in this room. And I'm not talking Puff." Okay? It's so hip. Oh. so basically you made me feel like an idiot because you're making a father-son reunion all about you. Honey. I think maybe it's those pink go-go boots that are making you feel like an idiot. Your father's gonna be so surprised. I know. - You look great. - Thanks. Where is he? - Um. Will? - Huh? You jumped into a tux. popped a Tic Tac in your mouth. took all of five seconds. This took all afternoon. It was like building a boat. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. you look great. and if I had a bottle of champagne. I'd smash it over your head. That is so sweet. Oh God. what are you doing here? Hi. surprise! We're here. I know. I got that. Grace. But I told you not to come. I know. it's your big night. We should be here. You shouldn't be here. Go do something fun. Go put on a sequined tube top. Dance on a box. Dad. we're staying. And why are you acting so weird? - It's like you're hiding something. - Of course I'm not hiding anything. - It's just a little complicated. - Will. Ted Farmer. - Oh. hi. - This must be your lovely wife. Grace. It's not that complicated. Please. I beg you. can we not get into this right now? - You haven't-- - How are you? Good to see you. - You haven't told them I'm gay? - Do you walk around - telling your colleagues I'm straight? - I think it's implied. - I begged you not to come. - But. Dad-- Okay. okay. guys. come on. I'm sure this is nothing that can't be solved by-- me leaving. - I can't believe this is happening. - Shh shh shh. - Don't make a scene. - I don't make scenes. Mom makes scenes. I don't make scenes. Oh my God. I'm two highballs and a tight dress away from being Mom. - You gotta understand something-- - I don't have to understand anything. - I told you-- - Hey. Mr. Truman. Mr. Truman. Will. you must be so proud of your father. Oh. well proud doesn't begin to describe what I'm feeling. - So. could we borrow him for a minute? - Please. be my guest. - I gotta-- - Yeah. Here. I got you this. You probably just want to get out of here. right? No. no. no. We're not going anywhere. Oh. you saw the rack of lamb? No. binge-o. I want to talk to my father. - Really? Here? - We are gonna deal with this tonight. Wow. Okay. So until then we're married. I guess that explains why you haven't touched me in 15 years. Hi. are you John Marshall? - Yeah. are you Jack McFarland? - Last time I checked. - Well. nice to meet you. - Yes. it's nice to meet you as well. Any idea why we're here? I got a call from this woman. Karen Walker. and she said to be here at 8:00 'cause I was gonna meet someone - who would change my life. - Wow. I got the same phone call. And I have a feeling she's right. We have three kids. Hannah. Rachael and Liam. Hannah played Queen Ester in the Purim play. Woman: Ohh. - Not a dry eye in shul. - Okay. - Sweetie. Iet's dance. - I don't feel like dancing. - They're playing our song. - Oh. they have a song. You two are so sweet together. - What's your secret? - I'm gay. That's what our son says. He's funny too. What are you doing? Waiting for you to talk to your father. And by the way. Dave in accounting has been giving me the eye all night. I'm not above cheating on you. Will. come on. Everyone has that moment when they realize that their parents are less than perfect. And I hate to break it to you. - but this is yours. - Look. I know my father. okay? And trust me. he wouldn't do this unless he had a very good reason. - Which is? - I don't know. But I intend to find out. And we are not raising the kids Jewish. It's steady work. but you know. I wouldn't be adverse to a change if the right opportunity came along. Yeah. interesting. interesting. You got good arms. John. You work out? Yeah. I try to. Like I always say. nobody likes a fatty. Oh my God. oh my God. only my personal mantra. Do you live alone? Yeah. uh Iook. can you excuse me for a minute. - I got a quick phone call. - Okay. sure. I'll be right here. Okay. Hurry back though. you don't want me to get cold. Oh. oh. honey. honey. I'm so sorry I'm late. - Is John here? - Yes. We met. we talked. he's fabulous. Thank you so much. Karen. I love him. Oh. Jack. It warms my heart to hear you say that. Or maybe it's the gin rickey I just had in the limo. Even on Skid Row I'm funny. I have a really good feeling about this. Karen. He's playing it cool. but um I think I might be gettin' some tonight. What the hell are you talking about? That man is your daddy. Not yet. No. I mean he's your father. What? Yes. I had Private Detective talk to your mom and he tracked down the guy in the Nixon mask. John Marshall is your father. Oh my God. you found my dad! Oh my God. I hit on my dad. - Ew! - Ew! - Ew! Ew! - Ew! Ew! I need soap. I need a Handi Wipe for my brain. Ughh! Oh. I hit on my father. I'm Soon-Yi. So. Jack. why don't we go someplace where we can be alone? - Ew! - Ew! - Ew! Ew! - Ew! Ew! No. you don't understand. You're my daddy. Not yet. - Ew! Ew! - Ew! Ew! No. In 1968 you went to a pool party. you had a Nixon mask on. you had sex with my mother. Wait a minute. 1968-- if we're talking about the same party. there we a lot of guys in Nixon masks. Well. Dick was big that year. And anyway. I'm gay. Me too. That must be where I get it. No. No. I mean I can't be your father because I don't have sex with women. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Not even once? - Could you? - Ew! Ew! - Ew! Ew! Thank you for coming. Well. you know. since we. um cleared the air. - want to get a drink at Boy Bar? - I'll get us a cab. Wait a minute. wait a minute! Don't you find this just a little bit eepy-cray? She is kinda right. It is weird. John. You know-- - I have tickets to the Backstreet Boys. - I'll call you later. Karen. This damn thing-- I-- I'm supposed to go on in a minute. So. four people have asked me where the newlyweds are registered. I told them "International Male." I have a feeling we're going to be getting a lot of mesh thongs. Will. I'm sorry. it's just-- ( groans ) What happened? Was it a misunderstanding - that got out of control? - No. Is it that you like Grace so much you wish we were married? God. no! I mean-- I-- I like her and all that. but no. Then tell me. because I know that you would never do something Iike this unless you had a very good reason. What do you want me to tell you? You want me to tell you that this company is run by a homophobic right-wing maniac? ls that what you want to know? I mean. here I am coming up on my pension. your grandmother insists on living year after year after year. and that's not cheap. If I lose this job. who's gonna hire a guy my age. Will? Who? Dad. I had no idea. Is that-- is that really true? God. I wish it was. Yeah. me too. What is this? Look. it-- it's not me. Will. There's a lot of small-minded people out there. I just can't stand the thought of somebody judging you. - People making judgments - All right. Dad. Dad. stop. I got it. It's the Captain Lenny thing all over again. What? You don't remember Captain Lenny? He used to introduce the cartoons on Channel 4. I was 10, you took me on that business trip to New York and there in the hotel bar was Captain Lenny. drinking a beer and hitting on a waitress. I was very upset and you said to me. "Willy. he's not really a captain. He's just a guy." Oh. you're killing me here. man. You're my dad. I love you. You did what you thought you needed to do. You're just a guy. George. you're on. Finally. What? What? Don't look at me like that. The girls take too long. Aren't you gonna wash your hands? So here he is. George Truman. - You okay? - Yeah. I guess. Thank you. wow. Lifetime achievement award. That's really an honor. My son's gay. Will. where are you? - He's here! - Grace. Hi. son. I-- I-- I told you all that. uh I told you all that Will and Grace were married and they're not. Will is Will is gay. He's a proud gay man. And I'm a proud father. Of a proud gay man. - (applause ) - Thank God that's over. No. no. no. I got a lot more to say. Oh my God. He comes into the living room. Iooks us both right in the eye. and he says. "Mom. Dad. I'm gay. And I want to bring my boyfriend home for Christmas." And I said. "You couldn't give me just a necktie. Iike any other father?" God. even when he's bad. he's good. And then. you know-- ah. no. I'm not even going to tell you about the time he did "Ben Hur" as a musical in the living room. Changed the title to "Ben Him." Will-- Will. stand up. Yeah. yeah. stand up. Hey-- I want everyone to see you. Come on. stand up. Come on. Will. Come on. Will. you're-- you're here you're queer and l-- I love you. dear. I love my gay son. everybody. Thank you. Thanks. Pop. - The wife is always the last to know. - Oh. stop. ( theme music playing )   
                




                    			Grace: But Josh is really great. you know. he's sweet. he's kind. he's very in tune with my body. A little too fond of the gentle forehead kiss. It's like being kissed by my grandmother. except Josh doesn't have a moustache. But still he's a solid B. B+. What do they seal these things with. high-grade epoxy? Cookies should be easily accessible. Hey. we're talking about my cookies here. I'm listening. I-- just grab hold of that end. will you? Thank you. I've been dying for a Milano since 63rd Street. - I don't think so. - Hey! Jack! Why eat them? Why not just apply them directly to your man teats? - Come on. - Give him a break. he's skinny. Let him eat his cookies. Hetero skinny is very different than homo skinny. You're not in the club. you wouldn't understand. Don't-- ( groans ) Open these. - What are you guys doing tonight? - Josh and I are going to the movies. Wrong. Will? - I was gonna go to the gym and-- - Wrong. What is the matter with you people? Will. tonight you're making dinner and the three of us will be parked in front of your TV to watch our new favorite sitcom "Along Came You." And why is it our new favorite sitcom? Because tonight Ed and Gerard are going to kiss. Only the first-ever primetime network kiss between two gay men. - Ooh. that's tonight? - It's in "TV Guide." Don't you read? - "Great." - I know, I'm excited too. - No. I meant watch out for the-- - ( crashes ) - Ooh. - grate. Hey. first-ever kiss between a gay man and 88th Street. - Not funny! - Oh. that was funny. That was funny. ( theme music playing ) Come on. Will. hurry up. you're gonna miss it. Okay. Woman on TV: You're sure you don't want tojoin me for lunch? No they don't. How come women never know when they're not wanted? - If that remark was meant for me-- - Shh-hh! You gonna talk through the whole show? Man on TV: Wow, so it's just us. - Man #2: Yeah, we're finally alone. - Yep. Just us. Ed, don't move, you have an eyelash. Oh. please. that's the oldest line in the book. I've used it. Me too. He's moving in. It's gonna happen. Oh my God. do you understand this is bigger than the moon landing? One giant step for man on mankind. Here it comes. here it comes. - Oh. Iet's hold hands. - Okay. Man #1 : I think I'm about to kiss you. Man #2: I think I'm about to be kissed. Gay sex is so hot. This is it. this is it! This is not it. Where is the camera going? Why are we looking at a fireplace? Get off the flames and follow the flamers! No. come on. they didn't show us anything. - I can't believe this. - Oh come on. Jack. what did you expect? I expected a kiss. I've been preparing for the kiss. I was on a juice fast for 72 hours so I'd look good for the kiss. This is a crime against humanity. Jack. two guys didn't kiss on a sitcom-- I don't think that warrants reconvening the Nuremberg jury. Don't throw your knowledge of current events at me. The network promised we were gonna see some guy-guy lip action. For someone who has a gay porn collection that requires its own storage facility you seem pretty upset about one kiss. Missing the point. darling. By doing this. they're sending a clear message that the way I live my life is offensive. Jack. the way you live your life is offensive. but they should have shown those guys kissing. I had a really good time. I'm glad we could meet for lunch. Hey. did you get the lumbar pillow I left with your doorman? I did. thank you. That was so sweet of you. It's filled with tea. The lady at the nature store said it's very soothing. particularly if you're cramping during menses. I had a really nice time. Don't say menses. Bye. You'll call me later? I will. Mmm. ( sighs ) He should be killed. He happens to be the sweetest. most thoughtful. most sensitive guy I have ever gone out with. I think he's great. He makes me wanna barf. I wanna kick him till he's dead. honey. Karen. no. I have just gotten off of a string of really bad boyfriends-- Adam. whose closest thing to a compliment was. "If you lost a little weight in the ass. you'd look pretty good"; Alex. who thought things could be improved by bringing another woman into the relationship; Stoner Jeff. who loved his bong more than me. I mean. Josh is the first guy in a long time who treats me like a goddess. Bye-bye. Josh! He is sensitive and caring. Thank you for playing. He truly loves and understands women. Don't let the door hit Grace's big ass on your way out. Hey. valley of the dolls? Josh is one in a million. He's sweet and kind and attentive and he'll be gone by the weekend. Yes. I'd like to speak to the President of NBC. please. This is Jack McFarland. How long will he be in the meeting? Very fine. I'll call back later. Hi. I'd like to speak to the President of NBC. please. It's Julianna Margulies. I have a cold. Hello? Hello? How do you stop unwanted homosexuals from invading your office? ( mocking laughter ) Come on. we're going down to the network to protest. Chop chop. You're still on that? Wow! I thought that will go away as quickly as your last big issue-- the underrepresentation of gay animals at the Bronx Zoo. They brought in a family of fruit bats. Coincidence? I don't think so. Let's go. Jack. I'm not going anywhere. I have to work so you can eat. - You're wasting your time. - I am outraged by this. - Why aren't you? - Because I'm realistic. Clearly. nobody wants to see two men kissing on television-- not the network. not the viewers. not the advertisers-- That's right. Will. They want to pretend we're invisible. What about our constitutional right to see two hotties get it on? Will that be the constitution that begins-- "Whee. the people"? Jack. you're fighting a losing battle. Go to my place. steal a sweater. have a nice afternoon and leave the silly protest to Woody Harrelson and his hemp flip-flops. Look. Will. I don't like to say this but I need you. Sure I have the face and the bod. hence the modeling career and the early years of dance. What?! But you-- you're the dowdy bookish sister. You're-- Will. plain and tall. I need you and your $10 words and your "be that as it mays" to help me make my case. Really? You can't just draw on your early years of dance? When you and your boyfriend here are done with your little game of slap and tickle-- Mr. Doucette would like for you to call him in the car. - He's not my boyfriend. - Whatever you say. Will. you coming or not? Jack. no. I'm sorry I can't. Just so you know-- we are no longer friends. Yeah. that's what you said last week at the movies when I left you the black Jujube. Thanks a lot. Will. Thanks for recognizing when something is really important to me. ( vacuum running ) I thought you promised to wear a French maid's uniform the next time you did this. Your place is filthy. PS-- Iived here seven months. you may wanna think about unpacking. PS-- I thought we talked about the PS. - What are you doing? - Just trying to help out. By the way. you have milk in the refrigerator that's so bad it's now good cheese. Where do you keep the scrubby stuff? - What did you do to Jack? - What? Every time you're a bad friend to Jack. you always become a better friend to me. He wants me to go down to the network and complain about this whole kiss thing and I said no and he's mad at me. How ridiculous is that? Hmm. Hmm? What? You think I'm wrong? All I said was hmm. Oh. but there was so much behind that hmm. Okay. Look. Jack has been focused on one issue for more than a day and a half. This is big. It may be ridiculous but it's important to him and he is your friend. I mean. to me that's reason enough to support him. Talk about something else. Ooh. pushed a button. Broken up with Josh yet? - Can we talk about something else? - Ooh. - Pushed a button. - I'll break up with him tonight. okay? Last night was really special. Yeah. it was. Tsk. do you really think that look scares me? Hah! I once walked in on Faye Dunaway with a wig cap. I'm not leaving here until the president of the network hears what I have to say. Please. have a seat. sir. - You're very crafty. aren't you? - ( elevator dings ) Just so you know. I'm not going anywhere. I'll chain myself to the desk if I have to. He will. He has his own chains. Oh my God. Will. I knew you'd come! I mean. what are you doing here? I'm here to help you. Together. you and I are gonna stick it to the man. Good idea. but let's do this first. Karen? It's Grace. Grace Adler. Honey. how did you get this number?! You gave me this number in case of emergencies. remember? Oh yeah. right. right. good. Yeah. I want you to have it. Stanley. have Butler change all the phone numbers on the second floor. So what's going on. honey? I have to be mean and I need an expert. Well. I'm flattered. What can I do you for? Stan. that had better be soap on a rope. Um Karen. I-- I can't get rid of this guy. He's a sweetheart but he's just not for me and I just don't know how to say it to his face. Well. say it to his bald spot as you push him out of the cab. Bye-bye. No. no. no. Wait. wait. I can't do it that way. How do I explain this? Most human beings are endowed with the capacity to feel emotion. Well. they're weak. Come on. help me. I need a good lie. Oh I know. honey. come on. that's easy-- tell him you're madly in love with Will. Of course. I don't know where the lie part comes in but-- I think it will work. You know what? This was a mistake. I'm sorry I even called you. Goodbye. Hey? I'm going to pick you up some wild yam essence. Thanks. It helps with breast tenderness brought on by water retention. Jack: And just as Ed and Gerard were about to kiss they cut away to the fireplace and I just find that reprehensible. What's your complaint? I want Carson back. That's important too. - Have you always been political? - You're speaking a little too loudly. - Oh. I'm sorry. - No. not you. I spoke to one of their PR people. He said they're sending someone down to talk to us. Who is this? - Will. this is my new friend. Crazy. - Got you. - Hey-o! - Hi. So. to do the Kegel exercise. you just clench and release. It's really quite wonderful. Like sit-ups for love's sweet flower. Wow! Almost brought up a little yam there. Mmm. siss-boom-bah! "What do you hear when Scrooge passes a stone?" That's very funny. I've the creeping fear that she enjoys her life more than I do. Because she has 250 people in her head. - none of whom own a toothbrush. - Hmm-mm. Get this over to Roz Weiman's office. Hi. I'm Craig Fissay. Executive Vice-President in charge of public relations for the office of the president of the network. You're his assistant. We spoke earlier? Anyway. I've been sent down here to respond to your complaint regarding the kiss on "Along Came You." Yes. we are outraged. I hope you presented him with my letter and the petition? - I did. - What did he have to say? Well. it was discussed at length and the final word is "No comment." Have a good day. gentlemen. and thank you for visiting us at NBC. Ding-ding-dong. Wait. no. whoa-- we are loyal viewers and consumers and we find your policies unfair and discriminatory. What you need to understand-- No. sir. what you need to understand is that this network has a responsibility to its audience. Now. I understand your disappointment. Believe me. I understand. - Hi. - Hi. But you will never see two gay men kissing on network television. Uh-- it's a gay network for God's sake! The symbol is a peacock. Have a nice day. Sally! Come on in. he'll see you now. Okay. Iet's go everybody. I said now. That was appalling. It's a travesty of justice. We need to take this all the way to the Supreme Court. We have friends there. We'll talk to that gay justice. You know that little fellow we like with the glasses. We've been over this. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a woman. I am not done with this. We need to get our message out there. put it on the national stage. I know. I'll write an epic poem and post it on my website What's an epic poem? - It's long. - Okay. scratch that. Okay. thinking. thinking. thinking I know. I'll use the news media. I'll talk to AI Roker. 'Cause as everyone knows. once you have an avuncular weatherman on your side. there's no end to your power. No. he's right over there doing "The Today Show." Al. Al! Al: All right! I'm sorry. Let's look and show you what's going on as far as your weather is concerned. Mm-mm! Big old. handsome warm front coming in from the south. Whoo! Oh. Stanley. you know I don't find that funny. Now get me another towel and put it on the real towel rack. Um. Josh. I have something that I really need to tell you and I don't know how to say it other than to just come out with it. Um. I'm in love with another man. You're-- It's Will. You met him. he lives across the hall. Oh. Jack: Al. Al! Will: Jack. there's 1.000 people here. he's not gonna talk to you. Al. it's my birthday. I'm a 100 years old. talk to me. Hi. what's your name? Hi. Oh my God. AI Roker! I don't know if you recognize me but my name is Jack McFarland. I do a one-man show every Wednesday night at the duplex called "Just Jack." Additional info on my website "Just Jack"? What happened to Jill? You guys have a fight? "No. it's my pail of water." "No it's my pail of water." Oh my God. that's so funny. Anyways. the reason we're here-- I don't know if you're aware but on this week's episode of "Along Came You." there was supposed to be a kiss and there wasn't. You know. Jack. sometimes a kiss is just not a kiss. - Do we have any anniversary here? - Whoa. whoa. back to Jack. We went to complain and this closet case upstairs-- cute in an offbeat way. got his number-- totally gave us the brush-off and I want to know how long I have to wait until I can see two gay men kiss on network television? Not as long as you'd think. Oh my Lord! Not your boyfriend. my ass. That's the love of my life-- kissing that guy. Man. that was incredible! Four second before I did it. I didn't know I was gonna do it and then-- I just did it. Yes. well. brava. I mean. but let's be honest with each other. We both know what actually happened this morning. Remind us. Masking your attraction to me with a political agenda. I mean-- you are so transparent. Wow! Nothing gets by you. I just pray none of my boyfriends saw that tragic display. Because that's like five serious long-term relationships down the tube. Five. huh? That's a lot of balls in the air. I just-- I just can't believe we did it. Yes. well-- despite how creepy the motivation. a lot of people out there owe us a big fat thank you. Well. thank you very much! Because of your little on-air lip lock. I'm gonna spend the next week in an ashram with no heat with my undumped boyfriend Josh. I thought you were gonna break up with him. I was. until some big queen on "The Today Show" blew my alibi. She's talking about you. ( theme music playing )   
                




                    			I don't know how these'll be. I had to try a different deli. I'm so bummed they closed down our old place. I loved it there. Stinking Board of Health. Okay. Grace-- what's going on with that necklace? Josh gave it to me. It's a Chinese serenity symbol. It means earth and air united as one. We have a similar symbol in my culture. It's called "cheap little stone hanging on a string." Don't give me the face. It's cute. We're glad you're seeing someone. Kumbaya. Good news. Will. Jackie! - Benji. - Hey. Whoa. whoa. whoa. Jack. what are you doing? Truman. come on. It's two men kissing. Don't get so uptight. It's not that. It's just-- when did earth and airhead unite as one? Chello. do you think you're the only one who uses this office? - Hey. Grace. - Hello. Mr. Doucette. Oooh. ice. ice. baby. Okay. Ben. I know we've had our differences in the past-- I decorated your place. you didn't like it. you're crazy. you didn't want to pay. I sued. I won. But who even remembers all that? Who indeed? What I'm saying is. I am perfectly willing to put it all behind us if you will just give me a simple. "I'm sorry." That's all. a little gesture. So. Will. this is your lucky day. I found someone I think you should go out with. - He'll take him. - Well-- uh-- No. no. I don't know. Blind dates Now. trust me. He's perfect for you. He'll take him. Slow down there. Trigger. Look-- what makes him perfect? - He's gay. - He'll take him. You're fixing me up with a guy just because both of us are gay? As I said. I'm past all this. I'm just giving you the opportunity to clear your conscience. Little. tiny. two words. Here's his card. He's an old poker buddy of mine. Call him. What? You want to be celibate the rest of your life? Thank you. Ben. it's not that I don't appreciate it. It's just that it's a little weird. You're my boss. it makes me feel kind of obligated. Good. See you. Jack. Living you. Ioving you. Iiving you. Grace. always a pleasure. Wow. The man cannot let go of anything. You know what? No, I'm not gonna to do this. Blind dates are a nightmare. Always ends up being with some guy who keeps yapping on about his two cats. while I spend the night figuring out how to get out of there by faking my own death. Excuse me. Mother Superior. It just so happens that I've met many fine young lovelies on blind dates. We're talking about blind dates. not blindfolded dates. ( theme music playing ) - Can I get you anything to drink? - Uh. yeah. Iet me have a martini. Oh. and look. since you're gonna be our waiter. um could you do me a favor? Could you be extremely rude and rush us through our meal? lnterrupt us and don't offer any desert. - Blind date? - Oh. yeah. No problem. ( whistling ) ( Scottish accent ) Excuse me. um I don't mean to sound critical. but I think your breadstick's a bit out of tune. Well. that makes sense because it's flatbread. - I hope you're Will. - I am Will. I'm Charlie. ( mimics accent ) By the way. I'm finding your Scottish brogue particularly appropriate for this venue. ( American accent ) Thanks a lot. dude. I love your accent too. Thanks for walking me back to work. Whoa. Got skirt? Oh. I almost forgot. - I have another gift for you. - Oh. Josh. you don't have to-- I saw this rock on Ninth Avenue and it reminded me of you. Beauty in an unlikely place. Oh. thanks. It's-- It's. um Josh. I don't think it's a rock. I think it's gum. Speaking of things you scrape off your shoe. get out of here! So where do you want to have dinner tonight? Wherever you want. Okay. but what are you in the mood for? Grace. I just want to be with you. so it really doesn't matter. Oh. Josh. Why doesn't this chair come with an air-sickness bag? You know. Karen. there's a pressure point at the base of your neck. I could work on it to help you release some of that anger. Lay one paw on me and you'll be picking up two other rocks on Ninth Avenue. Karen. don't make me get the hose. Josh. I'll see you later. - I wish it were later. - I know you do. Mmmm. Oh. you kissed my third eye. Save it! I know what you're gonna say. "Oh. he makes me sick. I would barf. but that would be a waste of perfectly good puke." "Mah mah mah. mah mah mah. mah mah. " Honey. what is this? Who are you? What are you doing? Look. Josh may not be perfect. but he happens to be a really. really great guy. Okay. he could be stronger. a little more decisive. He could go five minutes without saying "I love you." - ( phone rings ) - Grace Adler-- Thanks. Josh. you too. - But you can't change people. so-- - No, see, that's where you're wrong. Men are like dogs. You can either neuter 'em or train 'em. Now. go. go. Move. move. moo-ve. mooo-ve. Now you tell me what it is you don't like about the talented Mr. Wimpley. and I'll tell you how to change it. Okay. He takes pictures of me sleeping. He thinks that's beautiful. To me it's a little "The call is coming from inside the house." Easy squeezy. It's all about communication. You want to just sit him down. and you say. "Honey. you take one more picture like that and I'm not gonna have sex with you anymore." Huh? Yeah? How about that? Withhold sex? That's your technique? No. That's ridiculous. Oh. and please tell me that's not how you train your dog. All right. all right. fine. Different approach. Give me another example. Come on. Every time we go out to dinner. I'm the one who picks the restaurant. How come he can't make a decision? Simple pimple. Again. it's communication. You sit him down and you say. "Josh. if you don't pick a restaurant. I'm not gonna have sex with you anymore." I can't say that. - Of course you can. Say it. - No. - I'm not gonna have sex with you. - No. I'm not gonna have sex with you. I am not going to have sex with you. I am not going to have sex with you. I'll have sex with you. Mr. Doucette called from the car. He wanted you to know - that he's half an hour away. - Okay. - That was about 28 minutes ago. - Truman-- Thanks for the heads up. Nice work closing the Kinnally deal. I thank you and my house in the Hamptons thanks you. Oh. and I want to play racquetball with you at 6:00. Well. I should warn you. Ben. I'm a pretty serious racquetball player. I never lose. Until today. - Good man. - Oh. uh. by the way. Ben. just curious. you didn't happen to hear from Charlie. did you? - Yeah. I talked to him this morning. - Oh. Thought he might be out of town 'cause it's been three days since we had dinner and I hadn't heard from him. Three days? Wow. Guess I misjudged you. Whoa. whoa. What does-- what does that mean? I just thought it would work between you two. It didn't. But you said you misjudged me. Will. I don't know how it works in a gay relationship. but let me tell you how it works with me. Say I go out with a woman. right away you know she's attractive. but I mean stunning. She's having a fantastic time. Why wouldn't she? Look at me. Does it hurt your back to kiss your own ass like that? You get one of those a year. Will. Now. great date for her. so-so date for me. So at this point I do a cost-benefit analysis. Is the cost of pursuing this relationship worth the benefits - I will accrue from furthering it? - What exactly are you saying? You're a lousy date. Will. Later. Wait. whoa! I am not a lousy date. I happen to be a killer date. I have a great sense of humor. I'm a lot of fun. I make a decent income-- could be better. we'll talk-- and I've been told by more than one man that I am. uh well. hot. - Did he call you? - Did he-- What-- - No. - Will. I understand. I just knocked the wind out of your sails. You can barely make it through the day. - And? - And see you on the courts at 6:00. And I must warn you. I'm very limber. I can kiss my own ass. Coffee? So I tried your technique last night. So tell me already before I lose my morning buzz. Okay. we had a perfectly nice dinner at a Chinese restaurant. I chose. Josh then presented me with a beautiful leaf - he found in Central Park. - Puke. I know. We ended up at a video store. Josh. what do you want to see? I don't care. sweetie. as long as I'm in bed watching it with you. I'm happy. - Barf. - I know. Cut to: we are back at the apartment making out. clothes are coming off. he's getting excited-- Come on! Puke and barf. Skip to when you put the lid on the honey pot. So I pull away. He says. "What?" And then we get into the whole thing. the new ageyness. the indecisiveness. the leaves. the rocks. I didn't want to say it. but before I knew it the words were coming out of my mouth. "Josh. things have to change or I'm not having sex with you." - Ahhh! You didn't! - I did. - Was he shocked? - He was floored. - I am good. - Yes. you are. - So what did he say? - He dumped me. - I need to talk. Good. - I need to talk. Good. - What are you doing? - We always go to your apartment. Because your apartment smells like asparagus and shoes. Right behind ya. Before we get into this let's be clear. all I want is for you to listen and tell me I'm right. - That's all I want from you. Go. - Good. It's been three days. Charlie hasn't called. Now Ben says it's because I'm a lousy date. Ha ha ha ha. I'm laughing. Me? A lousy date? I think he's a lousy date for not calling me. right? Sure. Okay. my turn. Okay. Josh is a great guy. I really like him. but things about him could be improved. I tried to improve them by withholding sex. and what does he do? He dumps me. - He's a fool. right? - Yeah. Me. now. I mean guys always call me back the next day. Why? Because I got it going on. right? It's so on. I had every right to do what I did. As far as I'm concerned. it's his loss. - Yeah. - We're fine. - We're great. - They're messed up. - Mm-hmm. - I feel better. - Me too. - Ah! Why didn't Charlie call? I'm a bad date. Withholding sex. I'm a freakin' idiot! Welcome to the Jack McFarland date clinic. Let's go to zero. And the date begins - now. Hi. - Hi. Okay. Iet's stop right there. First of all. why would you choose to wear your fat jeans on a blind date? These are not my-- I don't have fat jeans because I'm not fat! How did I ever think this was a good idea? Because I'm an expert. Will. I go on literally thousands of dates a year. That doesn't make you an expert. that makes you an escort. Any particular reason we had to come back here? Hello? Scene of the crime. We have to retrace your steps to find out where exactly you went wrong. Now. Iet's start again. - Hi. I'm Jack McFarland. - I'm Will Truman. - Okay. stop. - Come on! What did I do wrong? I just said my name. It doesn't work. Will Truman. it's not-- it's a turnoff. Um what about Mary Fat Jeans? - Bye bye. - Okay. I'm sorry. sorry. Just giving you a little rough love. Look. I know you're in the dark. Iady. But the truth is you're a bit of a catch. Any guy would kill to be standing - where I'm standing right now. - Thanks. Jack. You will now forget everything I've just said. You didn't hypnotize me. you monkey. Didn't l? Now. back to zero. Your date is now becoming very bored with you. you can't afford to be coy. Why not show some interest by touching me gently yet inappropriately? There you go. very good. Ow! - What was that? - Okay. Iet's-- Iet's go back to zero. ( telephone ringing ) Answer it! Hello? l-- Honey. you scared me. what's the name of the company again? Grace Adler Designs. Grace Adler Designs? Oh. hi. Pharmacist. No. honey. I don't need anything for the weekend unless the FDA's approved something new. Oh. terrif. send me a bottle. Yeah. actually. make it two. Yeah. we're taking family portraits this weekend. Uh-huh. Okay. Send my best to Lorraine and the kids. Kisses. If you're finished violating federal law. do you think you could bring me those sketches I asked for two weeks ago? Honey. don't start with that or I'm gonna go after those pants. Listen. I know you're still mad at me about what happened with Josh. but when you think about it. really. honey. shouldn't you be mad at yourself for taking advice from somebody who was probably half in the bag at the time? So really I shouldn't be listening to you now? Probably not. Oh. I don't know. Maybe it's all for the best. I mean I really like Josh. but but maybe he's not what I need. I mean. I need a guy who has has more of an edge. who's a little tougher. And clearly that's not him. - I want to talk to you. - Josh. I was just talking-- You're not talking right now. I'm talking. I went home the other night very upset. I couldn't even meditate. I'm thinking. why is Grace acting like this? She's not manipulative. she's not callous. Where the hell did she get this behavior? And then it hit me-- she got it from you. ( gasps ) You. A woman who thinks an act of kindness is letting her stepkid have the fruit out of her whiskey sour. You know. there's only one thing worse than advising someone to use sex as a bargaining chip. and that's taking that advice. Maybe I have taken one too many stress management courses. okay? Okay? Maybe I should lower my dosage of St. John's wort. whatever. But I like myself and I'm not gonna change for anyone. I would gladly work out problems with you. but if you want to continue in this relationship. you take me as I am. - Oh. Josh! - Back off. Whoa. whoa. whoa. slow down there. cowboy. A gentleman always eats like a lady. Okay? And this is probably a good time to compliment your date. Tell me my eyes are pretty. - The bug eye or the other one? - Okay. See. this arrogance is why your date with Charlie didn't work out. - I am not arrogant. - Yes. you are. You've been acting superior to me all evening. That is not arrogance. that's scientific fact. Besides. we had a great date. We laughed he should have called me. You see? There it is again. And what's behind that arrogance? A layer of fat then fear. Fear rolled in fat. wrapped in arrogance. I am not arrogant and I am not afraid. Then why don't you call him? Could it be fear of rejection? Of starting over? Of opening yourself up to someone else? What? I think you may have a point. For real? - Wow. - In spite of your trying to help. Jack. you've actually helped. - I appreciate how much you care-- - Shut up! I totally made out with that bartender. ( dialing ) Uh hi. Charlie. it's Truman. Will Truman. And I really didn't mean to say that in a "Bond. James Bond" kind of way. Um I'm sorry I didn't call sooner. - but you're here. - Hello. So call me when you get home. Uh hi. what are you doing here? It's the only place in town that serves gray meat. It reminds me of home. What do you mean. you don't remember me? The glitter on my face. the Barbarella costume? - Mr. Doucette wants to see you. - When? - Truman? - Now. So. word on the street is you're not such a bad second date. Yeah. I guess I just need to work on my first date skills. - Were we supposed to play today? - No. I found another partner. Someone who's not gonna show me up on the court. - What are you talking about? I lost. - Not by enough. Come on. Ben. Let's skidooch. I'm on a schezule.   
                




                    			Ugh. will you let it go. already? I'm sorry. but your husband here put a shameless move on the produce guy when I had subtly signaled to him that he was to be my hothouse tomato. Subtly? You-- you put the vegetable hose between your legs and shpritzed me. Hey. guys. guys. guys. guys. I can end this right now. Although the produce man handles fruit. he does not sleep with it. He gave me his phone number. - He was fat. - Thing on his lip. Answering machine: You have one message. - ( beeps ) - Hey, Michael again. Listen, I've been thinking and I'm gonna give you one chance to reconsider. Come on, Face. Call me. I-- Oh my G--. Why is my ex-boyfriend calling you? Will. you stay out of this. Why is his ex-boyfriend calling you? The man who dumped him after seven years and left him with nothing but a broken heart and a couple of love handles? Michael called the other day. He's back in Manhattan. He just moved into a new townhouse and he asked me to decorate it. How could you even think-- Will. try and stay calm. Breathe. Here. put your head between my knees. Pass. Uh-- Will. I said no. I thought it might be kind of weird for you. "Thought". "might." "kind of"? How could you? Don't Will's feelings mean anything to you? Look. at least. I'm here for you. buddy. You can always count on me. even to-- ( pager beeping ) Oh. I gotta go. Toby found a car. Look. I d-- I didn't tell you that he called. because the last thing I wanted to do was to put you - in an uncomfortable position. - Grace! You should do this. You were Michael's friend. too. You hung out together. you were Buddhists for a week together. I mean. you gave him mono in a manner I'm still not entirely clear on. It's fine. I don't buy it. You're a well-known liar. You seem to have it in your head that this is a bigger deal for me than it is. It's been two years. I'm over him. Do it. - You sure? - I'm sure. Anyway. I know you want the job. - You're already doing it in your head. - I'm not. - Living room? - Ethnic texture. - Bathroom? - Plaid. fun. humor. - Bedroom? - Plush. white. the '40s. - But you haven't thought of it? - Hasn't even crossed my mind. ( theme music playing ) - Morning. - Afternoon. Honey. I went out for drinks last night with the girls. It was just me. Paloma. Marlo and Mr. Blackwell. They're all doing something. I mean. take Marlo. She's always working for charity. she's on the board of. uh-- Oh. what the hell. she's thin and busy. Just made me think. I mean. I'm 32 years old and what have I done with my life? Well. for one thing. you misplaced the better part of a decade. So. I've come to a decision. I'm going to decorate Michael's place. I mean. he's gay. how hard could it be? Chrome. black leather. a shower for six. done! Um. Karen. okay. You know what? I really think that you are just stretched too thin as it is. I mean. you have nails to file. Vogues to read. and those pills aren't gonna take themselves. Well. that's very sweet of you. honey. but I really think that-- Karen. I'm sorry. No. Oh. I understand. And you're right. I guess I really haven't earned this opportunity. Thank you. It's yesterday's. It's cold. And there's Kahlua in it. But thank you. - I could make a fresh pot. - You don't know how. I could fax something. You don't know how. - I could-- - You don't know how. Honey. I love this blouse. This fabric is just yummy. - You are a pretty lady. I don't tell-- - Okay. okay. okay! Okay. now you're creeping me out. Okay. you can-- you can do a chair. - One. one. one chair. - Oh. thank you! Oh. you won't be sorry. Michael is gonna be so happy. That queen will be sitting on a throne. Come on! Come on. come on. come on. I don't understand why you didn't just go in the movie theater. I can't pee in public bathrooms. Why not? You do everything else in them. Block. Come on. come on. come on. come on. - You look like you're in pain. - I am. That's why I probably shouldn't do this. Oh. Grace. one thing. I want the powder room to be kind of butch. Well. Iet's start with not calling it the powder room. Michael. - I used to live there. - I used to live there too. That's right. Was he a clean freak with you. too? Did he follow you around with a Dust Buster whenever you ate a muffin? You were allowed to eat in the apartment? He must have liked you more than a friend. ( chuckles ) Oh. okay. all right. here. Uh. I'll be right back. I forgot my vitamin E stick. I've been having such dry lip issues. But we have all day to talk about that. Goody. - Michael. - Will. Oh. my G--! Oh my God. Wow. - How are you? - Good. You? Good. I-- I haven't seen you. when-- when was it? Oh. it was the um-- - Yeah. I know. I know. it's been-- - Yeah. it's been s-- ( both laughing ) Yeah! Okay. We-- oh. Yes. Gay-ja vu. Uh. I thought that you and Jack were going to a movie. Yeah. we did. but Jack had a large Sprite. and. well. I promised him a gold star if we had a dry week. you know. ( forced laughter ) Ah. Okay. Well. you know. we should really go. because that way we won't be here. So we-- - Hey. Will? - Hmm? You look really good. Damn. my tiny bladder. I can't believe I missed what happened out there. Tell me everything. Start from the beginning. How did he say I looked? Like you'd put on a little ego. Can I just tell you. I could swear I just got a vibe from Michael. Iike he still feels something? - Really? - Well. I mean. come on. Yes. he's working with Grace. but do they have to meet two feet from the apartment we shared for seven years? Do they have to go to the restaurant where we had our first date? Did he really say nothing about me? He told me I looked good. Your boyfriend's back. he's gonna save your reputation Both:  Hey la. hey la. Will: You know what I think? I think he realized he made a mistake. So? How does it feel? - Good. felt good. - Yeah? - Don't tell me. tell him. - Really? - I dunno. I dunno-- - Look. Iook. Will. if what's holding you back is your attraction to me. I I just want you to know. it will never happen. Okay? Let that free you to pursue other. Iesser men. Oh. Jack. there are no lesser men than you. Thank you. (phone rings ) Karen Walker Designs. Oh. hey Grace. Yeah Oh. yeah. it's just been ringing off the hook all morning. No. of course. I haven't answered it. I'm too busy working on my chair. Oh. yeah. Good point. Why did I pick it up now? Hah! She's crazy. ( knock on door) - Will! - Hey. Can l come in? Well. the place is a bit of a mess. Still moving things in. but yeah. Yeah-yeah. sure. - Very nice. - Thanks. And it looks huge. What do you need all this space for? Well. I'm thinking of getting a chimp. You know how they like to cycle around the place. I've got my chimp on a Nordic Trak. He gets in his little suit and hops on. watches the TV. He loves it. But enough about Jack. - So. why are you-- - I didn't get a chance to tell you. when I saw you in the hallway of awkwardness that you look good. too. Thanks. Listen. I've been meaning to call you. - It's been a while since we talked-- - Oh. wow. The first thing we ever bought together. Unless you count the matching l-Can't-Even-Think-Straight T-shirts. Look at it. here it is. right in the middle of the room. Oh. the second hand is still broken. - Yeah. Yeah. I've been meaning to get that fixed. - Listen. you want to go for a walk? - Mickey. Iook Iet me say this first. You're back in town. you're-- you're spending all this time with Grace. You're hanging around the old apartment. Now the clock. I think we both know Look out. ill-advised impulse purchase coming through. Where do you want it? - Bedroom. - Right. New York movers for you. they move it and they judge it. - Will-- - Let me finish. It just seems like you may still have feelings for me. and I want you to know that that I also-- Do you need to be here for this? Uh. yeah. I do. Will. this is Andrew Kirkland. We live together. Huh. Wow. First they move you in. then they stay. - Will. he's my-- - I-- I know who he is. Michael. - Andrew. nice to meet you. - Yeah. I'm-- I'm gonna be going. And I'm going to take this with me. Karen: Oh, Grace. Thank God you're here. My head is spinning and not in a good way. Okay. okay. Karen. Calm down. calm down. All right. Iet's try a little experiment we did during my first year at the Fashion lnstitute. Okay. One kiss and then back to work. No. A different experiment. Okay sit in this chair and pretend you're at home. Honey. I can't do that. My furniture's good. - This is your third Manhattan. - I'm in the library. - Music is playing. - Good. Now. you are unwinding after a nice dinner of cocktail onions and lime wedges. - Mmm. - What are you doing? Probably yelling at the fat one. Okay. Yelling at the fat one-- known to his future therapist as Mason. Go. Okay. "Hey. Iittle Buddha! Where you going with those pies?!" That didn't feel quite right. - Try another one. - Oh. Okay. "Mason. sweetie. would you like a glass of milk with that pie?" What the hell?! Okay. we're gonna keep this one for your desk. - Next. - Oh. "Drop those pies. boy. You know the rule when we can see your neck. you can have dessert." "Rosario. hug the girl. The school said she needs affection." "Oh. and Stanley. for God's sake. get out of that tanning booth. you're starting to look like a cheese doodle." Oh. this is a good one. yeah. Oh. yeah. Does your jaw unhinge when you capture prey? How could you not tell me Michael has a boyfriend? Oh my God. what happened? Did you guys talk? Yeah. yeah. At his apartment. When I went over and humiliated myself. by telling Michael I still had feelings for him. Wait. What?! I thought you said you were over him. Well. excuse me for lying! Hey. hey! Hey. hey. hey! This is a place of business! We are trying to get some work done in here. and we don't need you just barging-- okay. I'm saying it and I don't even buy it. Okay. creative urge filled. but my urge for a gin rickey is still alive and kicking. Okay. I'm out of here. Keep on yelling. There you go. How could you not tell me something like that? I was trying to protect you. Oh! Nice. nice job of protection. Grace. If you were a condom. I'd be pregnant now. I thought I was being a good friend. Believe me. the last thing I ever wanted was for you to get hurt. Oh. I know. I'm sorry. I just-- I-- I was out of my mind over there. You know. I took a clock! Who does that? - The deco clock in the living room? - Yeah. Oh thank God. it was hideous. It didn't go with anything I was doing. - Grace! - Oh! Oh. right. Right. right. right. Your pain. How can I make it better? Just-- I just need you to tell me everything. It's much easier than finding out from other people. Look. I don't know. You're gonna get upset. - No. I won't. - You promise? - I promise. - Okay. what do you want to know? - When did they start going out? - Oh. you're gonna get mad. - No. I won't. Tell me. - January. - Oh. okay. see? Perfectly calm. - Of '97. What?! Two months after we broke up? Damn it. Grace! Why don't you just stick a knife in my heart? - But you said-- - Don't listen to me. - you know better than that. - See? I was right! I knew you were gonna get mad! God. I went over there. I was wearing the good jeans. I-- I-- I plucked my eyebrows so I wouldn't have that scary Peter Gallagher thing going on. I'm an idiot! - Sweetie. no-- - No. don't. I can't believe you did this to me. Hey. Iittle camper. How're you doing? Fantastic. Look. Will. you need to find some way to put this behind you. People get over people. I've had to get over a lot of people. - It's hard. - Jack. I had a seven-year relationship. You had a restraining order from the US gymnastic team. Okay. suggestion. Get off your Huffy bike and let me help you. You have to get past this Michael thing. And I think I have just the answer. Hi. Jack. why is there a sailor at my door? Because this sailor is your new boyfriend. ( gasps ) You may now thank me. Oh. there's a lot of things I'd like to do to you right now. I just need a yes or a no. Anchors aweigh. Vamos. Jack: I think he's gonna be okay. You want to hear something disturbing? That's the same guy Jack brought me when I broke up with Danny. Perhaps you've forgotten. but I'm not talking to you. Okay. Will. what did you expect Michael to do? Pine away in a dark room. while listening to "I Can't Live if Living is Without You"? No. There can be a lamp in the room. What is it? I just-- I can't-- I keep thinking I'm over this guy. and then it turns out I'm not and I get pain. Obviously, the same pathology that keeps me going back to see Kevin Costner movies. Sweetie. you invested seven years with Michael. Of course it's gonna take some time. Yeah. so how come he finds somebody after two months? Am I that easy to get over? No. No. you're not. Well. how do you know? - You wouldn't even-- - Will. I know. Oh. that's right. - You do know. - Mm-hm. Okay. it was at college. Okay. when you and I broke up. it was for different reasons. I wanted to raise the kids Jewish. you wanted to sleep with men. I really do enjoy that. Mmm. The point being. if I never got past that. we wouldn't have this. This this totally inappropriate. boundariless. highly-dysfunctional relationship that I cherish oh-so-much. Thanks. sweetie. And I know that you're feeling badly right now. but believe me. this too shall pass. I guess. I just with I could-- could say the same about this cake.

                    			So. when's your new lover supposed to get here? He's not my lover. It's just a date. And did you meet lover at lover's lane? Or did you two make a love connection at the love store while shopping for love lettuce? I forgot to tell you that your mother phoned and left a message. I've told you. he's not my lover. all right? It's just-- I'm doing a favor. He's-- he's my mother's dentist's bridge partner's son. which I guess technically makes me a loser. Wait a minute yup. I got the same thing. I met him once a long time ago. and if memory serves. he thinks he's God's gift to gay men. and if that's true. then God shops at the Newark airport. So. where are we taking loverboy? Mickey D's. Chuck E. Cheese. KFC? Hopefully. nowhere. See. Grace and I have a plan. She's gonna call me with some big emergency. and that way I have an out. It's so nice Grace does these things for you. - Mm-hmm. - Lucky. Someday. I hope to have a hag of my very own. ( knocks on door ) That's him. How do I look? I'm turned off and repulsed. Bonus! Hey. sexy! Hi. Neil. Ready to get Neiled? Hey. um. you may want to stretch. I know it's been a long time since you've been Neiled. Later. Iovers. - So. can I get you a drink? - Whoa, slow down. We'll get there. brown eyes. You're closer than you think. - (phone rings ) - Oh. thank God. Excuse me. Grace. hi. What's up? I'm at Mount Sinai Hospital with Karen. Stan's had a heart attack. Mount Sinai. Oh my gosh. that's terrible. I'll be there as soon as I can. ( whispers ) Perfect. A friend of mine just had a heart attack. so I think we're gonna have to do this another night. Aw Neil sad. ( phone rings ) - Hello? - Will. I'm not joking here. - Stan really is in the ICU. - Hang on. I'm on my way. Listen! Say something hospital. Uh. myocardial infarction. uh. Iime jello. and "That gown goes on the other way." I'll be right there. Look. I've got to go. This-- this friend of mine really is in the ICU. And later. Will. I see you? Oh. gee. no. ( theme music playing ) Ugh. this is always the worst part about hospitals. the waiting. Well. that and needles. Oh. I don't like needles-- don't like looking at them. don't like hearing about them. You know. I can't even say the name "Ringo" because he was a Beatle and that sounds like "needle." Hey. hey. how's Stan? What's go-- going on? We don't know. Karen's been in with the doctors for the last hour. So. what happened? - She murdered Mr. Stan. - I did not! I was redecorating his study. and Stan comes in and asks me if he could help. so I say. "Sure. would you mind moving the ottoman?" He does. The next thing I know. he collapses on the floor. - ( grunts ) - You lie. You should be in jail. - Liar. - Ringo. Gay ferrets to the waiting area. gay ferrets to the waiting area. How is he? What's going on? What time did you guys get here? - Why is no one talking? - Would you calm down? Don't tell me to calm down. Stan Walker is like a father to me. If anything ever happened to him. I-- I don't know what l-- Man. there are some really hot doctors in here. Hey! We don't have much news yet. Stan's in the intensive care-- through no fault of mine. Needle. Well. what about Karen? I mean. does anybody know how she's doing? I'm sure she's fine. If anybody can deal with this. it's Karen. Where are my husband's pills? It's been two hours since I asked for them. Now. you give me Stan's pills at once! I want those pills! Give me my husband's pills! I'm sorry. Mrs. Walker. there you go. Thank you. Look. why don't you guys go on and go home? I can take it from here. Okay. thanks for driving down. What? Well. we all know who Karen's going to lean on for emotional support. The same person she's always leaned on. her poodle. No offense. chica. but take your "cabeza" out of your "tuchus." If Miss Karen falls apart. you all know who she's gonna come to to pick up the pieces. Um. I don't think she'll be coming to anyone who wears a Members Only jacket. I'm telling you. it's going to be me. You're the last person she'd go to. Well. next to Will. Uh. excuse me. I am her lawyer. and let's not forget. she came to me when she was having trouble with her marriage. She came to me when she needed to do her will. she even came to me about a drinking problem. - You're kidding. - Well. she was out of gin. but the-- the point is. she came to me then and she will come to me now. - You think so? - Yes. I do. Care to make it interesting? Mrs. Walker. I have some news about your husband. Give it to me straight. Doc. Am I looking at a future filled with loneliness and memories of better days. or is Stan gonna die? Mrs. Walker. the test results came back. and it seems your husband didn't have a heart attack at all. - Oh. thank God. - But rather acute angina. You've got a lot of nerve coming on to me while my husband is dying. Uh. no. no. Mrs. Walker. Angina. it-- you know. he's gonna be fine. Which is good news for us. but I'm not entirely sure how your friends are gonna react. What are you talking about. Dr. Huxtable? They're taking bets to see which one you're gonna break down to first. Those pigs are making bets on when I'm gonna turn on the waterworks? Would you like me to tell your friends the news? Let's wait on that for a little bit. I've got a better idea. Okay. so. just so we're clear. The breakdown must include tears of emotional pain only. No pulling hair. no punching. And. of course. no tiny pinches. Wait a minute. you guys. are we being gross? No. we're not being gross. Besides. it's either this or 15 hours of reading Highlights magazine. Really. how many times can you find a toaster in a tree? Come on. are you in or you out? I mean. we know you're out. but are you in? - Can I borrow 100? - Sure. I'm in for 50. - Grace. you in? - Yes. I'm in. I'm in shock is what I'm in. You could bet less. No! How about a little compassion? How about a little selflessness? - Grace. can I see you for a minute? - I'm in. I can't believe this. I was sure it was gonna be me. I was having fun at the hospital. Now my whole evening is ruined. Hey. cheeks. And now the fun is back. Hi. Karen. Look. I just wanted you to know that if-- oh my God! Oh my God. what is-- what is that on the table. what is that? Is that a needle? ls that somebody's needle just out there in the open? It's a chopstick. you loon. It came with my lunch. Oh. Anyway. um. I just-- I just wanted you to know that-- that if you need to talk. or share anything. I'm here for you. Grace. we've been working together for. what. 11 years? - 18 months. - Seems longer. And you know me better than anyone. so. naturally. I want to open up to you. but l-- Karen. what-- what is it? What do you need? It's Stan. He needs blood for a bypass. and he needs it drawn slowly by a large. pointy needle. I-- I doubt that-- that I would even match. I've-- I've got a-- a very rare blood type. - I'm sure it'll be fine. - What type do they need? What type do you have? - What type do they need? - What type do you have? - AB negative. - That's the type they need. Jack: What'd I miss? - Stan needs a bypass. - ( gasps ) Grace is donating blood. I don't know how she's gonna do it. - I forgot. she's terrified of needles. - Poor girl. - Yeah. - So. is the bet still on? - Oh. yeah. come on. - Yeah. you got it. - Hi. everybody. - All: Hey! We don't really know anything yet. They're running some tests. but the doctors feel-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I need talk to Ja-- Will-- Rosario. where is my Rosie? I'm here. - You want to talk with me about it? - Yes. Yes. I do. Rosie. I'm just so worried about Stan. I-- no. I can't. I-- - Come on! Let it out! - Okay-- ow! Did you just pinch me? I just feel like I have so much emotion just bottled up inside of me. and if I don't let it out. I'll just-- I'll-- no. it's too filthy in here. I can't. - What? - Well. this place. it's so dirty. I mean. the stench of Medicaid and thermometer lubricant. You want me to clean the hospital? Well. just as much as you can get done. And while you're at it. why don't you take a look around and see what a real hospital corner looks like. okay? Now. shift it! Okay. Miss Adler. This is Nurse Trainee Pittman. She'll be taking your blood. I like your hair. Whoa. Whoa. Her? Is-- isn't there someone else who is a little more experienced? Someone who didn't drive in on a Big Wheel? Oh. I don't drive. I keep taking the test over and over again. but I'm all. "This is hard." Now. I don't want you to worry. 'cause Nurse Pittman is one of our finest trainees. and I'm gonna be here with you the whole time. (pager beeps ) Sweet. my new Jag's here. Don't worry. ma'am. I've done this bunches of times. Mostly on oranges. but Okay. I have-- I have a little problem with that. because. you see. I'm not an orange! I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't do this. Honey. I can't tell you what this means to me. - Oh. poodle. - Oh. Karen. what's the matter? Jack. I'm so worried. I keep thinking about Stan. Oh. I know. I know. I keep thinking about him too. Was that a tear? Did I win? I mean. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Honey. if Stan goes. I'm afraid we're gonna have to give up a lot of the luxuries that we've come to enjoy. Hey. Iady. as long as we've got each other. - Oh. - I don't care about that other stuff. No. What luxuries. exactly? Now. you may want to have a donut and some juice first. First? lsn't it supposed to be after? Wait! After? After? Dumb. dumb. dummy! What are you-- what are you doing? Karen's making me cut up my credit cards. I just wanted to say goodbye. Goodbye. Visa. You were everywhere I wanted to be. Diner's Club. didn't really know what you were good for. but I'll still miss you just the same. And Amex Platinum. I think I'll miss you most of all. - Need a tissue. buddy? - I'm okay. Maybe I should get Karen one. 'cause when you were talking to her. you really opened her up emo-- oh. no. actually that was you blubbering like a little girl. I'm sorry. You see. this is why she hasn't come to you. "Hello. my name is Will. I have no human emotions. I am made of only metal. wires and fat." Bloogy-bloogy-bloogy-bloogy. For your information. my job is dealing with people in crisis. and I'm particularly good at it. Why? Because I have a sixth sense about when people are in trouble. And yet she still hasn't come to you. Hmm. interesting. Why do you think that is. Arrogancia? Will. can I see you in here for a minute? Go with that. I think you're really onto something. Karen. did you-- did you want to see me? Honey. I-- I know we haven't gotten along very well in the past. - And? - That's it. Your turn. Look. I-- - You must be exhausted. but-- - Yeah. I just want you to know that I'm not just a lawyer. I'm-- I'm a human being. you know. with a-- with an ear and a shoulder. And a heart as big as all get-out. - Hey. cowboy. - Get out! You know. take a hint. I don't dig you. okay? Okay. okay. you don't have to tell Neil twice. Apparently. you do. Get out! I'm sor-- where were we? Honey. who was that? Wha-- what I did for love. I just wanted to say thank you for being my first patient. Ow. ow. ow. ow. Let go. Iet go. Iet go. Iet go! You need a sports bra to run this thing. So what would you like to do to Neil first? Well. the first thing is a surprise. but the second thing is bury you. Ooh. hot. ( clears throat ) Can I see you for a minute? She was-- she was looking right at me. Hold on. hold on. I just want to tell you that Stan is fine. - What? - There never was any surgery. The doctor says he only has a little angina. Wow. What a time to find out your husband's a hermaphrodite. So you were just playing with us when we were trying to help you? By competing to see who I would show my weakness to? - Karen. you're right. I-- - Bah-bah-ta-ta-ta-ta-bah-bah-bah. You played with me and you lost. Let that be a lesson to you. I think you forgot. kiddies. Karen Walker doesn't do emotions. Now get the hell out of here. So. who wins the money? Nobody. We got to split it back up again. Rosie: Oh. okay. - Rosie: It's gone! - Will: What?! Who-- Jack! Mrs. Walker, - I meant to give you that earlier. - Oh. It's some of your husband's personal things. Thanks. Doc. So. you must feel pretty good. Your husband's gonna be fine. You two really dodged a bullet today. Believe me. honey. he's so happy to be alive. I'm gonna be dodging it all night. Oh. Stanley. you and your pudgy little fingers. Karen. I just want to apolo-- oh. um-- um. um. I'll leave. No! No. don't. Do you want me to stay? I thought I was gonna lose him. Grace. It's funny, you know, we go through life pretty much alone. and then one day you meet someone and you hit it off. You have some laughs. some tenderness. and then. after a dozen Cosmos and a private dick's review of his liquid assets. wham. you're married. Then. as quickly as it came. it's taken away. But-- but nothing's been taken away. Stan's fine. Yeah. but someday he might not be. What do I do then? That man is everything to me. Maybe that's the blessing that's come out of all of this. You know. having Stan almost you know. made you realize just how much love you've got for him. I guess that's the trick. to remember that love and-- and to show it to him every day. You're right. Maybe I'll give him a little booby later. That sounds very romantic. Thank you. Grace. Okay. - Does this mean you forgive me? - Yeah. you're off the hook. Just as long as nobody finds out about this. - About what? - That's my girl. - I'll call you tomorrow. - Oh, Grace as long as we're being all warm and fuzzy here. you know how I always get on your case about the way you dress and the way you do your hair? Uh-huh. Well. really when are you gonna do something about it? ( theme music playing )   
                




                    			Where's the key? Where's the key? Will. you're just setting yourself up. we're not gonna win. I need the phone! I need the phone! Who are you. Vinnie Two-Times? Stop saying everything twice. Okay. okay. Okay. Why are you not more excited about this? This is front-row seats to a sold out Joni Mitchell concert. You love her. Will. regular people don't win these things. It's just losers who have their radio station on speed dial. ( speed dials ) Oh. Will! You do what you want but you are on your own. I'm not gonna get myself all pumped up about something. just to be devastated when it doesn't happen. Hello? I got someone. Oh my God. we're gonna win. we're gonna win. I knew it! Hi. my name is-- get off the phone! Jack: No, you get offthe phone. - Hang up! - No. you hang up. - You're such a child. - Nuh-uh. you're the child. Give me the phone. that's my phone. - It's my apartment. - It is not your apartment! Between 10:00 and 5:00 it is. You know the deal. That deal only exists in your head. - Give me the pho-- - No! Oh my God. naked pictures of James Van Der Beek. What? Where? I knew he'd crack. ( speed dials ) - Busy. - This call better be important. I was talking Rory through a very tragic body wax that nearly cost him a teat. It is important. It is Joni Mitchell and if we are the 105th caller. we win front-row seats. Okay. easy does it. geekalicious. It's not like it's brunch with Cher. Oh my God! How great would that be? ( mimics Cher ) More huevos rancheros. Jack. Oh. yes I'll hold. I'm holding. Oh God. please. just give me this one thing and I will dedicate myself completely to Thee. Okay. maybe not completely because. you know. I have a life. But trust me. I will make it so worth your while. Really God. if you think about it. it's win-win. Hi. yes. my name is Will Truman. I love your radio station. I even have it on speed dial. They're laughing at me. I'm sorry? I'm the 105th caller? I won. Could you just hold on for a minute. please? ( squealing ) Hi. yes I'm back. Truman. So. now what are you gonna do. Grace. huh? You made a promise to the big girl upstairs. What?! I'm talking about the Lord. Jack. just-- You don't want to mess with the Almighty. Grace. You don't want to go to hell. You know what heat and sulfur does to your hair. Stop it! I have every intention of keeping my promise. Thank you. yeah. We won! I know and that's why I'm gonna do something for charity. - Good for you. - And? And very good for you. You and I have to do something to deserve these tickets. This is not about miracles or divine intervention. okay? I had the skill to be the 105th caller. Don't-- no. I'm not doing charity. Look. Iook. I'm sorry. I'm hung up on this. so we can either drag this out or we can just shorthand it. Shorthand. - Will. do it. - No. - Please? Come on. - No. All right. God. you two are so married. ( theme music playing ) Jack: Oh my God. Karen. I'm so excited. I've never been in your closet. before. Well. don't get your hopes up. honey. you'll just be disappointed. My God! If my closet were like this. I never would have come out of it. Oh Lord. there's nothing here. I mean why do we have to do this? Hey. Grace hit me up to give clothes to charity too. It was hard but I dug deep and I gave away two bags of Will's favorite sportcoats. Yeah. but I mean look around. Jack. What could I possibly give away? I'll take these. The color really brings out my ass. Come on. focus! We're not here for you. we're here for the homeless. They are so lucky! I hope they know how lucky they are. All right. well. Iet's just jump in. Okay. here is a sweater. here is a hat. Here's my arm. here's my heart. I can't do this! Karen. of course you can do this. No. I can't! It's like giving away your own children. No. it's harder. You can always have another kid but Hermès only made this print once. Now. give me one good reason why a man can't go out in a nice pillbox hat. Hello. reason. ( gasps ) Oh my God. Iook. There are actually pills in here. Come on. put that away and help me out. Every item has such sentimental value. I mean. take this dress-- Stan gave it to me on our honeymoon and to this day. every time I wear it. he can't keep his hands off of me. Sayonara. You have a phone call. Hey. don't just barge in here barking orders at me. I'm in the middle of the hardest thing I've ever had to do! It's your pharmacist. Honey. I have to take this. Go ahead. I can handle it. Oh. you can handle it? lnteresting. I have spent most of my adult life and millions of my husband's dollars learning about fashion. What are your qualifications. hm? Umm I'm gay. Oh honey. what would I do without you? You never have to worry about that. Oh! Ew. I'll start with the Puccis and Guccis and work my way to Fioruccis and Susan Luccis. "Once I was lost but now I am found." Hi. I'm Grace Adler. this is my friend Will Truman. I called this morning. Because I believe. as I'm sure you do. that helping people-- Oh yes. I remember. You had me on the phone for 45 minutes. I get it. you care. you care. ( sneezes ) God bless you. ( chuckles ) I guess-- I guess that's a little redundant. I mean. of course you're gonna get blessed. I mean-- think of who you're married to. I mean. think of who your father-in-law is. whoa! I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous. I don't know from nuns. We generally ask our volunteers to put in a minimum of five hours per week. Five?! Yeah That-- you know-- my schedule is so nuts right now. between work and trying to have a social life. no offense. I thought maybe it'd be best if l-- Will. she does not want your checkbook charity. What she wants is us to give of our time. Ooh. you're one of those. We're willing to do anything for anybody at any time. As long as it's between Well. Iet's see. what have we got left? Our community bazaar is this weekend and there's an opening - on the entertainment committee. - Oh. that's perfect! Will and l. when we were in college. we had this little improv group-- The Zanies. Come on. Will. We're zany! Okay. I think I should tell you. you won't be doing the entertaining. Really? Well. we'll see. When do we start? You can start right now. Follow me. Our production of "Stone Soup" is this Saturday afternoon. You two can direct the children and narrate the story. ( children screaming ) Oh! This is gonna be great. kids love me. ( groans ) I'm trying to help! Okay. we-- we gotta slow down here. I don't think I can do this. This is a little more than I bargained for. Come on. you said you were gonna help. And I wanna help. but directing a bunch of screaming kids? Mister. will you save our play? Let's make magic. people. ( kids cheering ) Will: "and once all the vegetables were in the pot, the mysterious stranger stirred it into a rolling boil." "And the villagers cheered because they knew they'd be enjoying the delicious stone soup that they all made together." - Okay guys. say your line. - No. the other line. - Yay! All right. good one! Everybody grab a cookie and gather round. - Are you two married? - Married? No. I'm never ever gonna get married. Girls are yucky! Right back at you. broc. You read too fast. You forgot half your lines. Iittle Miss Roughage. Grace?! That carrot has been giving me attitude for three days. If she doesn't watch out. she'll end up in a juicer. She's six. Nurse Ratchet. - I'm just trying to help. - Don't try so hard. Relax. Besides. it's all gonna be over in a few hours and then tonight Joni Mitchell! Oh my God. I can't wait. I was a free man in Paris I was unfettered and alive Okay Iet's just leave it to Joni. What do you think? I thought you liked my singing. Huh. Okay. Now. this afternoon. remember to speak up and don't turn your backs to the audience. okay? And have a good time because it's gonna be the best play ever. right? Right! - We're gonna have a lot of fun. right? - Right! We're all gonna keep our costumes nice and clean until then. right? And after the show. we're all gonna go out for ice cream. right? Right! By the way. we're totally not doing that. Okay. now the play starts at 5:00. which means everybody should be in their costumes. ready to go at what time? - ( kids yell different times ) - 4:30. exactly! Wait a minute. children. I have something I need to say. ( coughs ) Oh. that ferkochta flu will be the death of me. Anyway. since you all have done such a good job. Father Gallagher has decided to make the play the finale of tonight's bazaar. Yay! Be here at 7:30. you go on at 8:00. - Yay! - 8:00?! See. we have plans at 8:00. We have front-row seats for Joni Mitchell at 8:00. so we have to go. I mean you would do the same thing. I've never been beyond that fence. I can't believe this. we're gonna miss Joni Mitchell. What can we do? We made a commitment. Yeah. I guess you're right. - No one ever said charity was easy. - Yeah. You know I'd go back there tomorrow But for the work I've taken on-- Sweetie. don't make it worse than it already is. Look at this place. It's virtually empty. Jack really cleaned me out. I heard an echo this morning in the fur vault. Yeah. yeah. you are a giver. And I think we've got a yes. ( chuckles ) Yeah! It doesn't work. What-- what the hell do you know about fashion? You're packed in there tighter than a blood sausage. Hey. you washed up on the shore of this country in an inner tube wearing a banana leaf and a couple of coconuts. Listen. Iady. I flew here on business class with my AAdvantage miles. Now take it off so I can clean it and burn it. The only thing that's gonna burn is your arm when I put my cigarette out on it. Try to remember that the next time you open up your boca! It's the scarf. isn't it? - It's a cleaner look without it. - Okay. What about the shoes? Oh come on. you didn't even have to ask. Oh. Miss Karen. you love those shoes like your own husband. Bite your tongue. Husbands come and go but the Chanel slingback is forever. - Oh! - Santa Maria! My slingbacks! They were one of a kind. What have you done with them? What have you done with my shoes? Nobody like to see you squirm more than I do. but I would eat the food you provide for me before I would touch those pumps. Who could have done such a horrible thing? Who would be stupid enough to take those pumps? Now sound it out-- mysterious. What. what are you doing? Nothing. I was just giving Megan here some notes on her performance. - I'm gonna be the narrator. - ( Grace chuckles ) - But. Grace. you're the narrator. - I know that. You know. I just think that we all should have an understudy. - You know. with the flu going around-- - She's going to Joni Mitchell. I am. What? You-- Come here. You drag me into this and now you're going to Joni Mitchell? I got the tickets. if anyone should be going to Joni Mitchell. it's me. How could you be so selfish? Hey. Will. come on. the carrot already knows my part anyway. Okay. Grace. you wanna go? Go! Oh no. you're not gonna lay a guilt trip on me. - I'm staying. - Good. stay. Will. I'm not staying. it's Joni Mitchell! I can't believe you're doing this half an hour before the show! - Come on. it's not like I planned this. - There's a taxi here for Grace Adler. Okay. that is downright spooky. I should probably go check on that. Yeah. run along. Go take your big yellow taxi. I thought she'd never leave. Lord. would you look at these people. Why anybody would choose to be homeless is beyond me. Karen. nobody chooses to be homeless. It's because they did something bad. I can't bear to think of my babies in a disease-ridden hellhole like this. Karen. this is a church. Don't lecture me. Saint Mary. this is your fault. - Just go find my shoes. - All right. all right. Jeez! Excuse me. you must get this all the time. are you Mary Todd Lincoln? No. and you must get this all the time-- could you take one giant step back? Okay. ( gasping ) ( both gasp ) I'm so sorry. I have to ask you-- are you the gentleman who yells obscenities outside Papaya King? Yeah. that's me. Oh. I knew it was you. You're very good. As an actor myself. I just have to ask you. how do you tap into all that rage? Try not eating for a week. Ooh. I wish I had that kind of willpower. What do you want? What are you after? What are your terms? - 10. Seven. - One. Three. - Yellow. - Wha-- uh. blue. - Five. - Five? - Five. - All right. five it is. - 100. 200. 3-- - Oh. I can't wait. five whole dollars! Right. Yeah. five whole dollars. You drive a hard bargain. Okay. I don't know how that got in there but there you go. honey. Wow. five dollars! This is my lucky day. Uh. crazy! Make it your lucky year. Come on. Thanks. Karen. I saw what you did just there. You saw nothing. Karen has a heart. Karen has a heart. Oh. all right! I don't even know why I did it. Maybe it's like it says in the Bible-- "I felt bad because I had no shoes. but-- then I met someone who had really bad shoes." "Once upon a time. there was a village where people didn't know the value of giving" Megan. Megan! "And one day. a muster-- - a meester"-- - Mysterious. "And one day. a mysterious - stra-- stran--" - Stranger. Grace: "And one day, a mysterious stranger came to the village and taught the town folk a valuable lesson and that was the story of Stone Soup." - When do we bow? - Now. - You guys were great. - Flawless! And the broccoli. carrot. radish-- fantastic. Onion. you brought a tear to my eye. All right. everybody go say hi to your parents. You were great. - Good job. - Here we go. So. what happened? Well. you know. I was just sitting there trying to enjoy the concert but all I kept thinking about were the kids and their bright little faces. I was asked to leave the concert for singing too loud by Joni. At least. Melissa Manchester had the courtesy to call security. Anyway. it was-- it was like I had it coming. You know? Anyway. I'm so glad I got back here. you know. even though all the kids still hate me. - What? - I don't hate you. Grace. I like you. I think you're pretty. Out of the mouths of radishes. - You do? - Yes. That is so sweet. See. this makes it all worth it. Yes and when I grow up. I want to have fake hair just like yours. Now that's what makes it all worth it.

                    			Okay. a-- a-- a school report. two pieces of paper. a hemline in a hurry. What? I don't know. Give me another clue. Uh. your Aunt Honey's stomach. - Things that are stapled! - Thank you. Yeah! All right! Great time? - 22 seconds. - Okay. not bad. If they don't get the next one in seven seconds. we won. - Shorthand. we won. - Ha! Okay. good luck. you guys. You can do it! And here we go! Me and you. - People who are getting married. - Correct. What? Well. you know. we've thinking about it. - and we just fi-- - What. in four seconds? They must have cheated. They suck at this. This is the-- Maniac. they're not playing the game. they're making an announcement. Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Congratulations! And we won. Hey. I have a chilled bottle of very expensive champagne. which I have been saving for a special occasion. Who wants coffee? Um. Will. there's actually one more question I need to pop. Um. will you be my best man? Rob. you are not only my friend. you're my accountant. and any guy that can figure out a way to deduct Jack McFarland as an entertainment expense. come here. Wait. wait. wait. Okay. we're not done. Grace. would be my maid of honor? Oh my God. Ellen. That is so sweet. Come here. No. What?! Wh-- ( gasps ) - Well. why? - Well. gosh. you don't want two redheads in the wedding party. It's a red menace. Since when. Grace? Since never. I made it up. - I'll do it! - Oh! - Of course I will! - Thank you. Grace! I am so. so jazzed about all this. You know. you guys. you're the best. and-- and we hate to cut this evening short. but we got to break the big news to everyone in our line dancing club. Oh. well. While you're there. you might want to break the news that line dancing is over. - You kidder. - You guys are the best. Love you guys. - Congratulations. - Bye. The red menace? What was that about? Oh. um. you know. I just-- I just have this issue with Ellen. It's a long complicated story. - So give me the short version. - I slept with Rob. Good night. Whoa! No. no. no. no. no-no-no-no. Gonna need the long complicated version. Go. Okay. Danny and I had just broken up. Ellen and Rob were going through another of their breakups. In a nutshell. chance encounter at a restaurant. Rain. booze. sympathy. knees touching. more booze. more rain. more sympathy. cab ride and then stuff. I can't believe you haven't told me this. I mean. there was that time last April when I was so depressed. and this would have pulled me right out of it. yeah. You see. this is exactly why I didn't tell you. Because I knew that you would enjoy it. that you would make jokes and judge me and call me names. and-- Grace. give me a little credit. - You little minx. - All right. that's it. ( theme music playing ) Okay. bachelor party. Let's review what we've got so far. My name in bubble letters and then a picture of a man on a donkey. I got nothing. Oh my God. I got a donkey. too. Well. you know why we're blocked. 'Cause heterosexual marriage is just wrong. I mean. if God had intended man and woman to be together. he would have given them both penises. I believe I heard Pope RuPaul Il say that. I know. a progressive spa party. We'll go from one lovely bachelor's pad to the next. And at each place we'll do a different treatment. A steam facial here. a deep pore cleansing there. and then knock-knock. "Hello. seaweed wrap?" "Yes. come on in." That is the gayest thing I've ever heard. I know. Isn't it yummy? I can't do it. I can't do it. Will. I can't do this bridal shower. I am so racked with guilt. I'm delusional. I'm making the finger sandwiches. and they're all giving me the finger. Why so guilty? What'd you do? Will and Grace: Stuff. Look. I'm having a bachelor party here. You're having the shower in your place. If you start to freak out. come over and get me. It'll be fine. I promise. - Okay. - All right. Okay. Oh. oh. oh. I know. I know what this is. Will told me everything. Grace. you really did it this time. Oh. oh. - You told him I slept with Rob? - Uh. no. Works every time. Listen to me. Chatty Cathy. You keep this to yourself. Not a word. We do not speak of this again. You understand? You little minx. That was fun. Now I'm hungry. - Take me to Black Angus. Sss. - No. no. We got to figure this bachelor party thing out. so. I mean. just think. Straight world is backwards world. so what is the absolute last thing you and I would want to see at a party? Hi. I'm Sergeant Goodbody. and I'm here to give Rob a citation for being a very bad boy. Oh my God. a stripper! You know. Rob. as your attorney. I would usually advise against this sort of thing. but as your friend. I say par-tay har-tay. Did I do that right? - I think you have to add a "whoo-hoo." - Whoo-hoo! ( knocks on door) - Karen? - Hi. honey. What are you doing here? Oh. I was just taking a little walk. You don't walk. Well. I was just going out for a little snack. You don't eat solid foods. I love you. Oh. right. right. Oh. Stan's mother's in town. Oh. I'm telling you. she's evil! I'm being tortured in my own home. She's irresponsible. she's lazy. she drinks. And worst of all. she makes fun of what I wear! What are you supposed to say to a woman like that? Uh. Karen. may I take your coat? Thanks. honey. Karen. you cannot stay. Ellen is gonna be here any second for her bridal shower. and she's bringing a couple of friends from Weehawken. Oh. come on. Let me stay. I've always wanted to see those people up close instead of driving through their habitat and having 'em jump on the hood of the car. Come on. No. No. Karen. Ellen is a dear friend of mine. and she's entrusted me with the responsibility of being the maid of honor and I take it very. very. very seriously. Oh my God. you slept with the groom. What?! How did you-- well. what did you-- do you have three sixes on your head? No. but I got a fifth in my bloodstream. Even in an adulteress's apartment. I'm funny. Oh. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. So. who'd like the first lap dance? - Rob. - Oh. gosh. I don't know. I mean. Ellen's across the hall and I've got that hiatal hernia. Well. uh. Steve? Nah. I can tell she doesn't like me. Okay. Ira. she's all yours. My lap's a little tender right now. - What does that mean? - Just leave me alone. All right. damn it. I'll do it. I mean. I've copped a feel. Might as well feel a cop. All right. come to Poppa. ( knocks on door) Okay. we're gonna sit down now. and you're gonna pretend like you're a human being. - You little minx. - Not a word! - Ellen. hi! - Hi! - Welcome to your shower. - Oh my God. my shower! - Come on in. - Hi. And you've done one of your picnics. - Isn't it fun? - Oh. so much fun. I can't believe how much fun. Grace. everything is really cute. I hope you didn't put yourself out. Oh. too late. Jack? Jack. what's going on? Why did you run out in the middle of your lap dance? Does your ass have attention deficit disorder. too? Well. something really bad happened. I got-- I got excited. You mean excited like I-want-to-wear-what-she's-wearing excited? No. excited the way the three of the four Baldwins and one of the two Quaids get me excited. Oh my God. it's finally happened. You've gotten so gay. you've looped around to straight again. This isn't funny. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. - I'm freaked out right now-- - Calm down. - I know exactly what to do. - What? Tell Grace! Oh my God. Jack got turned on by a woman? Well. he couldn't be straight. so what. now he's a lesbian? Well. he's got the haircut for it. So. how's it going for you. sleep-around Sue? What happened to "minx"? I'm saving that for just the right moment. - Minx. - Can we stop? I'm sorry. You drop a bomb like you and Rob sleeping together and. what. - I'm supposed to let it go? - Will. please. Little dirty. dirty. cutie-cutie. sleeping with Robbie-Robbie-- - Oh. - Oh! Will. Iisten. is it okay if we watch "The English Patient"? What? That's not a happy face. Ellie. we were broken up. I mean. I was a mess. I was out of my head. He's right. You know. when a man gets that low. he'll reach for anything. anything. Yup. that's me. I'm the step you take right before the gun. Somebody tell that skank not to talk to me. And you. Mr. Man. are worse that a skank. You're a skunk who sleeps with skank! Skunk! Skank! Okay. okay. Ellen. I-- I'm so sorry but could we just agree that kind of language is uncalled for? The wedding's off. Grace. - Oh. Ellen. you can't-- - Ahh! I am so humiliated and disappointed. and I just pray to God our friends never find out about this. Everybody, Rob slept with Grace. The wedding is off. You and your big mouth! Me? What about him and his big mouth?! You know. as far as I'm concerned. you both have big mouths. I slept with Grace. Wedding's off. What do you want to do? Go in there. get Rob. we will work this out together. No. no. I can't go in there. Everybody hates me. Grace. I promise you. no one is even thinking of you. right now. okay? All right. okay. - Hi. everybody. - (yelling ) What were you thinking?! - Poodle! - Oh. Karen! I know. I know. I know. Honey. Will told me. Listen. I'm sure it's just a fluke or an allergic reaction. I mean. Stan's head swells when he eats a peanut. Karen. I know the difference between 6:00 and 12:00. and this was midnight at the oasis. All right. all right. Well. come on. Iet's try a little reenactment and see if we can figure out what happened. Sit down. Okay. Now. she probably started out with a little of this action. Ohh. yeah! Well. she wasn't really that boob-intensive. She just kind of sat on my lap and moved around a lot. Oh. well. then it was just simple friction. Okay. come on. Here we go. Okay. all right. This is the way the wheel goes round The wheel goes round. the wheel goes round Karen. you're chafing me. Just give me another couple seconds. It's not working. Maybe not for you. It's no use. I'm a freak. I'm an aberration. I'm a man that gets turned on by women. But not by me? You know. that hurt. You should be careful what you say. You should realize that words are weapons. you little sissy! Now. wake up down here! Karen! This isn't about you. this is about me and this sickness I have. Jack? I've been looking for you. I still owe you half a lap dance. Um. could you just give it to the needy? Look. I never do this. but I think you're really cute. so if you change your mind. here's my card. Oh. that's very nice of you. I don't think I'll be changing my mind any time soon. Carl. so-- because I'm a-- You're a Carl? From the waist down. From the waist up. I'm Carla. So. you're not a girl? Not yet. but God willing. by fall I will be. Oh. thank God. I'm still gayer than Christmas. All right. speaking of half-women. I gotta get back to Stan's mother. Oh. hey! Hey. say. come on. come with me. We'll scare the crap out of her and you'll get you $1.000 closer to your snippity-doo-da day. Come on! Ellen. peaches. Iisten. The thing between Grace and me meant nothing. That's right. El. nothing. - It was just a meaningless encounter. - A wrong detour. A pathetic. miserable act between two desperate. sweaty people. Did I say that out loud? Look. El. she was nothing compared to you. You know I don't like bony girls. It was like-- it was like having sex with a cricket. Yeah? Well. I was fake chirping. - Please come out. - Please. Ellen. I'm not talking to Skunk or Skank. I will only talk to Will. Cricket? I'm so never sleeping with you again! Ellen. I know you're hurting. but there's something you got to know. Rob is hurting too. - Do you have any condoms? - Top drawer. Well. I mean. he-- he loves you. He cares for you. - I'm sorry. condoms? - Yeah. we're having sex. It's the only way to even the score with Rob and Grace. - It has to be done. - Okay. wait-- so. slow down. - One of us is gay. - Yeah. get over it. Now. I want you to throw me on the bed and have your beastie way with me. Ellen. that is not gonna happen. You and I are not gonna-- oh my God. you're in a bra. Get a load of these torpedoes. Ellen. damn the torpedoes. Give it over to your mama. Stop! Stop. stop. Look. I know you're in pain. but this is no way to deal with it. I mean. Iook at you. Iook what you're doing. ( gasps ) Oh my God. you're right. Oh my God. Iook at me. What is wrong with me? I'm just a dumb. stupid idiot-head. Oh. Ellen. it's okay. It's-- it's just-- Now. I'm gonna grind you like fresh cup of coffee. Don't worry. Will is fantastic in these kind of situations. Trust me. he will not come out of there until he has fixed this. Yeah. yeah. you're right. I-- I give up! All right. forget it! I-- this has gotten way out of hand. There's a crazy woman in there coming at me like-- Iike Chucky in a C-cup. - What now? - You know what? There's only one person who can make this right. Hey. I'm not going back in there unless she is sedated or trussed up like a turkey. I'm talking about me. Will! Oh. right. yes. go. - Good for you. - Come on. Iet's do it. - You can do it! - We got faith in you. buddy. Go. Rob! - Never gonna happen. - He's a dead man. Oh God. what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? I know! I know! I'll do what I did in college. Oh. Grace. I got rid of my bong years ago. Not that. Whenever Ellen or I would get into a fight in college. I would make her a tunnel-of-fudge bundt cake. We would talk. we would eat. and somehow everything would work out okay. Of course. much like the apple brown Betty that ended the Battle of Guadalcanal. Grace. we don't have time. Don't you see that I have to do something? I mean. Ellen is one of my oldest and dearest friends. I mean. when my father was sick. Ellen was there. When I didn't get into that Paris program. Ellen was there. And then when-- and when Danny and I broke up. Ellen was-- well. Rob was there. but-- but Ellen was just a few blocks away. God. now I've totally ruined their marriage. Rob: Oh! Ho, ho! - Was that you? - Huh-uh. - So that means that was-- - Uh-huh. - Right there in your-- - Oh. yeah. - Let's get out of here. - No. I can't go anywhere until I know that Ellen's forgiven me. - Ellen. have you forgiven Grace? - Ellen: Oh God, yes. Good enough for me. - Want to get something to eat? - No. I want to get some new sheets.   
                




                    			Hey. looking good. I'm having an insect invasion. New York roaches are getting way too bold. I just found one wearing a pair of my shoes. Look at you two. with the cologne and the tightness. - Where are you going? - This new club downtown. Yeah. it's where the old club downtown used to be. Oh. oh. great! Okay. just gimme two minutes. Both: Ooh! What "Ooh?" I love gay bars. I always go to gay bars. There's not a gay bar in town I haven't been to with you guys. Okay. just figured out what why I'm alone and dateless on a Saturday night. You have a boyfriend. Call Josh. No. he'll just want to see some chick flick and then talk about it. I wanna-- I wanna go with you guys. No. I'm sorry. We're having a meeting of the He-Man Woman Hater's Club. No girls aloud. Right. Spanky? Me. too. neither. Hmmph. Fine. I don't need you two to have fun. I have a big night planned. - Ant traps are under the kitchen sink. - Thanks. Uh. Val? Hey. Hi. Oh. I'm sorry. I was just doing a little some-- something for the security camera. Little gift for the boys in the basement. Shut up. I do the same thing. I hate to disappoint you both. but that's not a security camera. that's a smoke detector. - Val. do you know Jack? - No. Val. the lunachick who got in a catfight with Grace and tore her clothes off? Speaking. - I am such a big fan of your work. - Ooh. thank you. Thank you. Hey. you guys want to go have a cookout on my fire escape. - 'cause I got a new hibachi? - Ooh. tempting. No. we're going to a club. - Oh. really? - It's all you can eat after midnight. - I didn't know they served food. - They don't. Well. I guess I'm the only loser with nothing to do on a Saturday night then. Get off. get off. get off! - And then there were two. - Nighty-night. - Hey. - Val? - Long time no see. - Yeah. I-- I think the last time I saw you. you were smashing my face into the carpet. Well. it looks like that burn above your eye went away. Actually. I just stopped plucking in that area. - I just got ditched by two gay guys. - Oh my God! Me too. - Really? - Yeah. Hey. well. do you want to kill bugs and watch infomercials? I'm wearing pointed shoes. You're on! - Really? - Yeah. Oh. good. I like your hat. I got one in faux fur. ( theme music playing ) Oh my God. They're pulling her whole face off. - Ew. ew. ew! - Oh. I love this show. Can you imagine doing that to your face? I would never do plastic surgery. It's gross. I know. It's so demeaning. - Pathetic. - Totally. I might do my eyes. Well. sure. That's medical. I'm also thinking of getting a butt lift. Not surgical. just pay some guy to walk behind me and carry it. If I'm not married by the time I'm 35. I'm doing my boobs. That's not medical. Sure. it is. I want to marry a doctor. My ex-husband wanted me to get a boob job. and so I got rid of him. Well. that and the fact that he was sleeping with his dental hygienist. Why is it always the hygienist? What is it? Is it the white uniforms? The latex gloves? I think it's because they're whores. Well. hey. Lady La-La. What are you doing in here? Oh. Stan's been socking down the herbal Viagra again. and this is the only room in the house he doesn't know about. Shh. Karen. guess what? Tonight I met the one-- the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. Hey! There is only one man in your life. and her name is Rosario and don't you forget that. His name is Bill. Iook. And he gave me a picture of himself. Isn't that a great idea? I'm gonna start passing out pictures of myself to people I meet at clubs. Honey. did you even read this? Well. I read the picture. And it said. "Mommy. Mommy. gimme some of Jack." Ah! He is the head of some group called "Welcome Back Home." Well. I'm sure it's a typo. He must mean. "Welcome Back. Homo." "It's never too late to get back on the straight and narrow"? Honey. this is a cult. Yeah. Iike the Moonies or the homeless. Yes. they're trying to make gay people straight. Good Lord. Don't they know what that'll do to the fall line? "Renounce your homosexuality"? "Make the choice to be straight"? "Gay is not the way"? Jennifer Jason Leigh. these people are freaks! Yes. and it looks like your new sweetie has turned his back on homosexuals. and not in the good way. no. Don't listen. Bill is not straight. I mean. Iook at us. Karen. We're lovers. Lord. I wonder if Stan's exhausted himself on the body pillow yet. Wait. They're having a meeting tomorrow. We have to go. What this organization is advocating is morally wrong. and it is my responsibility to shine the mirror of truth upon them. Honey. - Okay. I want to make out with Bill. - Okay. Ooh. he's so cute. isn't he? I know. I know. honey. but it's a waste of time. all right? It's like exercise or reading to your kids. The man thinks he's straight. There are no straight men. only men who haven't met Jack. Yeah. Well. you can count me out. If you think I'm gonna spend my Sunday morning with a bunch of self-loathing closet cases-- - You get to be a lesbian. - Wake me by 11:00. So. Val. what are you doing Tuesday night? Tuesday night? Oh. I'm going to a movie and then out to dinner. - With you. silly person! - Oh. yay! Wow! - Yay. - Wow! If these walls could talk. So. how was girl's night out? I dunno. I got hit on by a guy named Beverly. which. you know. in England. is a very common name for-- for women. - Bye. Val. - 'Night. guys. - Bye. - Bye. Wow. So. no bruises. no cuts. no torn clothing? - What the hell happened? - We had so much fun. I don't think that I've laughed that hard since you and-- that's odd. My music box is missing. What? The music box my Dad gave me for my Bat Mitzvah. Did you borrow it? Yeah. Yeah. I took it to the bar with me. Nothing says "Hey. there" Iike a pop-up ballerina. It was here. Val even-- even commented on it. - You don't think she - What? stole it? I mean. she has tried battery on you. why not theft? Well. I hope you're happy. Thanks to you. I didn't sleep all night. Well. I've got news for you. mister. Val did not steal my music box. - She is my friend and I trust her. - Okay. Which is why we are breaking into her apartment. so I can prove to you that it is not there. Great. just give me a minute to get my black leotard and suction cups and I'll meet you on the side of the building. Hurry up. - ( door slams ) - Grace! Understand what you're doing? This is breaking and entering. We can't go to prison. We're too pretty. Relax. I'm the president of the tenant's board. I'm allowed to go into any apartment in which I suspect a gas leak. But you don't suspect a gas leak. Man. you're not gonna last two minutes in the slam. Wow! Now we know who's buying everything on eBay. Okay. come on. Let's start looking. Man. Iook at all these snow globes. "Greetings from Times Square." Aw. Grace. Iook. It's snowing on a hooker. Okay. put the hooker down. You're so convinced she took the music box. find it. Actually. Grace. you know what I'm more convinced of? That I don't care. Then why would you call my friend a thief? I take it back. What are you. a child? There's no takesies backsies. Okay. so start looking. It's a brown music box that plays "Hava Nagila." Well. you're not going to find it. And why? Because Val did not take it. ( "Hava Nagila" playing ) Well. unless you've been using musical suppositories. I think we've found it. Oh. God! Hey. - Surprise! - Surprise! What are you two doing here? Um. uh-- we thought you had a gas leak. Then why do you yell surprise? Well. we didn't say it was a nice surprise. My Lord. Iook at these people. Just because they stopped being gay doesn't mean that they have to stop having taste. Look. there he is. There's Bill. Jack: lsn't he dreamy? Yeah. he's a slice of ice cream cake. When do I get to French kiss a girl? Come on. come on. Patience. Clarice. The best way for me to get close to Bill is to act like a straight guy. That way I can win him over and release his inner homo. I haven't seen this many closet cases since the Academy Awards. Well. hello. You must be the newcomers. I'm Kevin. and this is my wife Jodie. We're one of Welcome Back Home's biggest success stories. Four years and counting. Can you believe that we actually used to be gay? What? You two? I'm plotzing. Help yourself to the buffet. Forget what you think you know about corned beef hash. And try the deviled eggs. My Kevin made 'em. They're world famous. My secret is chopped scallions. Honey. was that two men or two women? Jack! You're here. Oh my God. it's Bill. - Take it out of the head voice. - Oh my God. it's Bill. Jack. I'm so proud of you for coming. As a former gay man myself. I know how difficult it can be to take that first step. Welcome back home. Uh. dude. I came home a long time ago. Uh. this is Karen. the old ball and chain. I used to dig chicks. Hah! Yeah. Oh. well. welcome back home to you. too. I'm sorry. when I saw you at the bar last night. I assum-- Oh. no-no. I was just trying to get my bud. Will. back on the straight and narrow again. yeah. He's a big fat flamer! He's in love with me. so-- me. I like the ladies. Right. babe? Wow. Wow. that is just a beautiful thing to see. - Isn't being married great? - Yeah. Is there anything better? Yeah. riding on the back of a Harley with Angelina Jolie. Oh! That's why I brought her in. - See. she needs a tune-up. - Yeah. - Rrmm. rrmm! - Ah. party on! Well. that's what we're here for. to support you in your new life. - Girls. we got a slider. - What's that? Come on. Karen. You're just in time for the make-up seminar. - We're all gonna get cheekbones. - Oh. well. that's nice. honey. And. uh when are we gonna learn about bras? Well. well. well. Alone at last. In a heterosexual straight kind of way. you know? So. yeah. you want to watch the game? What game? You know. foot-- skipball? - I'm back. - We missed you. - I hope you like Sunny D. - I Sunny do. Oh. wait a sec. Ah. that's for you. For you. Are you gonna? Okay. Val. I-- I don't know how to say this. but where did you get the snow globes? They belonged to my ex-husband. He loved them more than anything. So. naturally. I made sure that I got them in the settlement. So you sort of got him by the globes. I squeezed 'em real tight and I shook 'em. shook 'em. shook 'em! Yeah. Globes are fun. You know what else I love? This music box. where'd you get that? Oh. I got that with-- with a big kitty. they came as a set. - How long have you had it? - Oh. for like forever. Oh. what's it play? This old lrish song that I love. - Sweet. Can I hear it? - Sure. Gosh and begorra. gosh and begorra Gosh and begorra. my lrish eyes It's "Hava Nagila!" It's not an lrish song! It's an ancient Hebrew song about something Jewish! My dad gave this to me for my Bat Mitzvah. You stole it! Grace. I am hurt. How can you say something like that? Read the back. Is your Hebrew name Rachel? Give it to me. - No. it's mine! - It's mine! - It's mine! It's mine! - Hey. hey! All right! Can we take a breath. okay? God. you two. I swear. when you get together. I know what it must be like to be the father of-- - Get off me! - Come on. Grace-- oh! My globes. What a great play. Up high. See. before. when I was gay. that high five might have sent a tingle up my thigh straight to my home entertainment center. But now that I'm straight. it's just a couple of guys celebrating the ball doing something good. Exactly. Welcome Back Home teaches that physical contact between two men is okay. as long as there's nothing behind it. - That's us. right? - Sure. Yeah. ( grunting ) How do you do it. Iadies? How do you stay straight with so many fine looking chicks around? Well. we try and keep our love life fresh. so we don't do it that often. Oh. you're lucky. Jack just wants it all the time. And I want to please him. but-- I don't know. Whenever we're making love. I just can't stop thinking about Rosario. - Who? - She's our maid. but she's so much more! Yeah. whenever I see her up on a stepladder dusting. my eyes just travel up those thin supple calves to those thick. trunk-like thighs. I just-- oh. I should stop. - No. go on. - ( all talking ) - Hey. that was a great game. - Yeah. so. want to hit the showers? - What? - You know. Iike they're doing. Jack. I don't think that's appropriate. Whaddya talk? It's just a couple of naked straight guys soaping each other down. Okay. I-- I have to say something here. The backslapping and the head rubbing was one thing. but the ear blowing and the butterfly kisses are not standard NBA practice. And now this shower thing? What do you imply? You're coming on to me. What? I am shocked and appalled! But are you interested? You think that you can just come in here and use this group. this group that puts people back on the path of righteousness. as some kind of dating service? I just need a yes or no. No. And I want to make something crystal clear to you and to everyone else in this room. Excuse me. we are here to lead normal. heterosexual lives. Man and woman are meant to be together. So anyone here who has a misguided notion that Welcome Back Home is some kind of a-- a gay pick-up joint. you can just leave right now. Well. Iook at 'em go. I haven't seen a stampede like this since Pamplona. Oh! Oh my God. Iisten to me. I'm a funny lesbian. I'm Ellen. As long as it's a heterosexual soap down. Attagirl. I'm so sorry I kicked you - that second time. - Yeah. - But you did get in the way. - I know. It's my fault. I should know to wear a sports cup around you two. - Can I ask one small question? - Yeah. I would alternate ice and heat on them until the feeling comes back. Different question. Why did you bend over backwards defending this woman. - when it was so clear that-- - I know. I know. I know. She was fun. And I need more women in my life-- besides you. It was big of you to forgive her. I thought the hug was a nice touch. Screw forgiveness. When she was hugging me. I stole her watch. Grace. you crafty little-- okay. this is my watch. ( theme music playing )   
                




                    			Grace: This is so unfair. Why do we always have to have breakfast at your house? I have a house. Yes. but you have no food there. nothing to eat with or on there. and it smells like bologna and wet cat there. - Since I'm already here. - Mmm. Cereal? Generic bran flakes? How geriatric. Oh. no. Bran flakes kick in? No. it's our alumni newsletter. Joseph Dudley retired. - Oh. - Heart problems. - No! - Yeah. No. Professor Dudley. I loved him. He was the best teacher I ever had. and the only one who never hit on me. Grace. he was gay. Ladies and Grace. You'll be happy to know that I have found him. Sex. The love of my life. And he's from Belize. Puh-leaze. Jack. we're really not in the mood. We just got some bad news. Oh my God! It's about James Van der Beek. isn't it? Is Beek off the "Creek"? Is Jack smoking crack? God. he was brilliant. you know? - And such an inspiration. - Yeah. He's the one who made me want to write. - You don't write. - But I wanted to. And. you know. when I graduated. I told him I'd keep in touch. and then I never did. I feel so guilty. Okay. it's getting just a little too "Tuesdays With Morrie" in here. Why don't you just go visit Jack Lemmon and get it over with? What? I read the movie. You know? I think Chrissy might actually be onto something here. I mean. he is-- he's our Morrie. You know what we should do? We should rent a car this weekend and go visit him. Oh my God! Yes. Iet's do it. I need to see him. I need a shot of his optimism. and positive energy. You know. I actually called someone a bitch the other day. Um. that was me. And you were. ( theme music playing ) ( chuckles ) ( blows raspberry ) ( clicking tongue ) When are you going to realize I'm not talking to you? Probably when you stop talking to me. I just don't see why it was necessary to humiliate me at the Alamo desk. I was just flirting with the cutie rent-a-guy. By making fun of me. Okay. so I don't know that much about cars. Grace. he asked you if you wanted a V-6 or a V-8. and you said you preferred a Diet Coke. - I was making a joke. - No. you weren't. No. I wasn't. but that still does not excuse two gay guys sitting there laughing in my face. Like I don't get enough of that at home. You owe me an apology. - You really upset me. - Okay. okay. I'm sorry you're upset. Ho-ho! Interesting. It had the word "sorry" in it. but somehow it still made the whole thing my fault. I'm sorry you see it that way. Okay. there it is again. Okay. do you think that maybe you could take a little bit of responsibility?! All right. all right. I'm sorry that-- that when we were at the Alamo desk. I chose this car. because I coulda had a V-8! Lord. why did I agree to cook dinner for Stan on his birthday? I must have been sober or something. Now. that'll never happen again. Karen. trust me. I can teach you. I've had years of experience working under some of the finest chefs in New York. Honey. ease up on the Giorgio. That was so nice of you. - Feels so good to help. - Yeah. Come on. this'll be fun. Will's away. We can use his stuff. make a mess. and we don't even have to clean up. Hey. hey. hey. come on. this is serious. If you can't teach me how to cook. I have to have sex with my husband. So you better make it high fat. because the only thing I want hardening that night are his arteries. Ooh! A note. I love notes. Jack McFarland. do not-- I repeat. do not. under any circumstances. enter this apartment. I'm having my floors redone. and I forbid you to walk on them. Do you understand? - What's it say? - It's not for us. Now. Will just had the floors redone. so we have to respect that. - Chh-chh-chh-chh - Whoo-whoo! - Hello? - ( Will knocks on door ) Professor Dudley? It's Will and Grace. I'll be right there! Oh! Did you hear that? He always knows just what to say. ( sighs ) Will. smell this place. It smells like knowledge. Yeah. knowledge mixed with tomato soup and just a hint of A and D Ointment. - Ah. Will Truman and Grace Adler. - Hey! Hi. Professor. If you've come for inspiration. you're too late. If you've come for the funeral. you're too early. ( both laugh ) - Hey. you look great. - How've you been? How have I been? I loathe myself. Now. who wants a wine cooler? - Wow. - I know. Maybe we should've come on a Tuesday. Honey. there are a few too many things that are flaming in this kitchen. Karen. would you relax? I'm toasting the croutons. Ah! We're being robbed! Mrs. Walker. we've been through this before. Now. I am not a prowler. I am not a bartender. I am not the black guy from "Designing Women." I am your lawyer. and maybe if you'd stop bobbing for olives for half a minute. you might remember that. Hm. you're kinda hot. Jackie! Hello. Benjamin. Oh. you're still mad 'cause I beat you at racquetball? Uh. you know what. Ben? My life's a little too hectic to be mad about losing a game or two. - Or 12. - Okay. we get it! You're huge. You're sports cup runneth over. Why are you here? ls Stan in trouble again? 'Cause. Iisten to me. you tell that secretary of his. one woman's sexual harassment is another woman's night off. No. No. Will told me to stop by and pick up some papers. so I'm-- Jack. are you cooking that salad? 'cause. you know. it's-- it's better when you don't. Um. Ben. we're buds. we're love. we have history. Um. if you look around. this isn't the racquetball court. I think you're a little bit out of your element here. okay? Well. actually. before I went to law school. I was a chef. I studied in Provence. In fact. I won an award for my coq au vin. Yeah? And I won an award for my nyeah-nyeah-nyeah. Okay! Well. I'll remember that mood for when I beat you left-handed. - See you later. - Yeah. wait a minute. wait a minute. wait a minute. Iawyer man. hold on a second here. Listen. we're in a crisis. If I can't cook my husband rack of lamb for his birthday. he's gonna be craving rack of me. All right. Well. I'll help you. but you have to say those magic words. - Billable hours. - Let's get it on. - But. Karen-- - Sorry. fruit. you're out of the loop. Come on. I-- I can't believe what I'm hearing. I mean. this-- this is you. How can you say your life has no meaning? Yeah. I mean. you had such an impact. You-- you made me want to write. So. you're a writer. What have you written? Um. Will wants to say something. You-- you touched so many lives. Does that not mean anything to you? I'm afraid that's all sound and fury signifying nothing. Or. to put it in layman's terms ( blows raspberry ) Did the wisest man we know just go ( blows raspberry ) I believe he did. And now. every other week. I've got all these ex-students coming up here to visit me. just because they've read "Tuesdays With Morrie." How unbearably pathetic. Hmm. - How indeed. - Yeah. We've never even read that book. So. you haven't written anything and you haven't read anything. I can see I've made a marvelous impact. Uh. I'm sorry. This is like I'm talking to a different guy. I mean. you used to be so positive and so upbeat. Now. not to mention my role model as a-- as a strong gay man. I mean. what-- what happened to you? Oh! Why do we always have to have dinner at your house? You know I have a house right next door. Do you have any food over there? Do you have anything to eat with or on. that isn't covered in cat hair? You're starting with me? Very nice. How about a little kindness. you miserable old fairy? Will, Grace, this is Sharon Timmer. she's my best friend in the whole world. The pie is frozen. You're serving them frozen pie? Dudley: The pie will thaw. Sharon: When you're dead it'll thaw. Sharon, you have all the charm ofa flesh-eating virus. Are you gonna say it. or am I gonna say it? I'm gonna say it. You had way too many onions. Not that! Them! They're us! They are not. They're not us. Will. when he put down the bottle of Correctol by her lamb chop. she said. "Ew." I say "Ew." Will. she is exactly who I'm going to be. Who knew I gas going to develop a taste for turquoise jewelry? I mean. ew. Ah! Ew! Ah! Would you relax? You're blowing this way out of proportion. Oh my God. that's my china pattern. Be sure not to bruise the lettuce. You've got to treat this salad like a lover-- gently. sensually. Are you getting it? Oh. I'm getting something. honey. Hmm. doesn't look like much of a salad to me. Where's the arugula? Where's the radicchio? Where's the Rwanda? Jack. one of those isn't a salad ingredient. so much as a war-torn country in Africa. Duh. I sponsor a kid in Arugula. Hi. Ben. So. the salad's done. the risotto is cooking. Let's talk wine. Karen. you have any preference? Honey. I'd suck the alcohol out of a deodorant stick. so you're asking the wrong gal. okay? Karen. are you saying you don't care about the wine? No. honey. I was just flirting with you. Grace. you're such a lovely young lady. Tell me. how come you're not married? Oh. well. um. I was engaged last year. but it didn't work out. Oh. really? Well. what happened? - Sharon. - I'm just making conversation. Joe. So. Grace. what made you not go through with it? Um. well. we were just so different. and I wasn't ready. and-- - And Will didn't approve. - Sharon! Uh. well. no. he didn't. but that's not why I didn't-- Because heaven forbid. there should be any other man in your life besides Will. Darling. when the moonlight hits you like that. I can just make out the venom glistening on your front fang. Hey. hey. did anybody see that special on Discovery last night about the human liver? It is quite the filtration system. Interesting organ. the liver. Produces bile. Joe. I would imagine you'd have one the size of Utah. Speaking of things the size of Utah. have a seat. Sharon. Okay. stop. enough. I can't take any more. What-- what is the matter with you two? What do you mean. darling? Well. you-- you're awful to each other. I mean. sulfites and digestive enzymes get along better that you two. What? The liver has trouble breaking down sulfites-- - Sweetie. no. - Oh. I mean. you became friends for a reason. What happened? Well. nothing happened per se. In the course of a 30-year friendship. bad patterns emerge. difficulties arise. It's impossible to pinpoint the-- December 15th. 1978! Faculty cocktail party! The topic was 19th century French literature. You brought up Balzac. and I thought you were making another one of your crude gay jokes. So I responded and you mocked me in front of your whole department. And the worst part is that you just wouldn't apologize for humiliating me like that. Our relationship has never been the same. Wait a minute. that-- that's it? That's what's eaten away at your friendship. the way cirrhosis eats away at a human liver? Enough with the liver! And you. Professor. if you know that-- that all it would take is-- is an apology. then apologize to your friend of 30 years. My God. she deserves at least that. You're right. You're right. Sharon. I'm sorry your education system failed you. You don't know the difference between a 19th century novelist and a feeble pun unworthy of even Dick Cavett. And Joseph. darling. I'm sorry the only Balzac you've thumbed in the last 20 years sits on a dusty shelf in your study. - Hag! - Queen! I'm sorry I always make you eat breakfast at my house. I'm sorry I got you involved with "A Course ln Miracles." I'm sorry I took the batteries out of Mr. Good Vibrations and put them in my alarm clock. That was you? I'm sorry. Most of all. I'm sorry I made fun of you at the rental place. You know a lot about cars and you're a very good driver. Thank you. I really appreciate that. So just. you know. remember that - the next time-- - Grace. no! ( car honks ) Sorry. - Hag. - Queen. Oh. darn. I spilled all over my sweater. - No. you didn't. - No. I didn't. but I made you look. So. Jack. what do you think? Good? Mmm. I've had better. Jack. you cleaned your plate with your tongue. Okay. fine. I liked it. all right? It was fabulous. You're a fabulous cook. You know everything about everything. But can you do this. hmm? All right. can you do this. hmm? All right. that's it! I've had just about enough! I can't take any more of this. because you have shamed me here today. And now it is my turn to shame you. Now. there is one thing I know-- I know I can do better than you. Really? What's that? Tap dance. - You think so. huh? - Oh, yeah. I must warn you. I've studied with Tony Wing. the Chinese Fred Astaire. Prepare to be amazed. Karen. count me off. please. Five. six. seven. eight. Jack. wow. I mean. you have it all over me. - I fold. - Wise man. Now. if you'll excuse me. I have to go to the little girl's room. - What? - Are you kidding. honey? Five. six. seven. eight! What are you two toasting about? Your victory. honey. - Oh. thank you. - Jack. Look. Ben. don't be so hard on yourself. okay? It took me years to get that good. ( theme music playing )   
                




                    			Okay. What do you think of them? Oh. I knew you'd hate 'em. God. it's just a stupid invention. What made me think that a little pillow that cups and cushions the ass against the ravages of subway travel would be a good idea? I like the name "The Subway Tush." And there's the icky face. Okay. I'm leaving. I knew you were gonna think it's stupid. I'm so humiliated. - What is he doing-- - Wait for it. At least have the decency to sit on it. I think you'll find yourself saying. "Did my heinie die and go to heaven?" Ooh. Oh my God. This feels really good. Oh. my tush is loving the cush of "The Tush." Yeah. it's squishy. It's comfy. It's oddly exciting. Overall. I'd have to say. it's the butt's meow. Shut up! Oh my God. you really like it? I knew you would! Now. there's just one teensy little thing. I need $50.000 for start-up costs. Well sure. Jack. Do you want me to write you a check or shall I pay you in cheese? I can take a check. Hey. zippy. I'm not giving you any money. Selfish! You believe that guy. soaking me for 50 large? Forget about it. Okay. First of all. you've just officially been cut off from "The Sopranos." And second. how could you just dismiss him like that? - What are you talking about? - Look. it is hard for him. I work all day. you work all day. He comes home at 3:00 to an empty house. I worry about him. Sooner or later. the boy's gotta learn that life is not easy! Uh. I guess you're right. Our little girl is growing up. ( theme music playing ) Grace: So, once again, I just wanna say thank you. Honey. quit thanking me. You sound just like Stan after-- just after. No. no. Really. really. I never would've gotten a meeting with Robert Lilienfield if you hadn't made the call. Come on. Grace. you could've gotten it on your own. You get it? No way. Oh. drink your lunch. ( whispers ) Oh my God! - Look who it is. - Honey. I don't look. I'm looked at. - Who is it? - It's Helena Barnes. She's like-- Iike the best interior designer working today! She-- Iook at her! Look at her! No! No! Don't look. She'll see you looking. Okay! She's looking away. Go look. Iook. Iook. Oh. good Lord love a duck! Hey. Hel. put the caboose in motion. Somebody wants to meet you! Come on! Oh my God. Hi. I am Grace Adler. - and it is such an honor-- - Karen. I was convinced that nasty smell was coming from the kitchen. No. honey. I think you just caught a whiff of your own liver rotting. Listen. I want you to meet Grace Adler. She-- she thinks you're really something special. but then again. she's never seen you face down in a pool of your own sick. She hasn't. - Grace. enchanted to meet you. - Oh. hi. The honor-- the honor is mine. I mean. I would curtsy. if it weren't weird. Oh my God. I'm like one of those losers. when they meet William Shatner at a Trekkie convention. - Oh. you are adorable! - Thank you! Oh! Hi! Who is this? - This is Paxil. - Oh And she asks that you don't touch her. Oh. well. whatever little Paxil-waxil wants-- Nor speak to her. - You know. Hel. Grace is a designer. - Helena: Oh. She's great. She's better than you. I'm sure she is. Well. Karen. I'd love to sit and watch you suck your stomach in for the next 20 minutes. but I really do have to go. I've got such a busy week. Between the Sandler's beach house and Pierre's new restaurant and an interview with Robert Lilienfield. - I simply don't have a moment. - Robert Lilienfield? Yes. Can you believe that he wants to put me through the formality of an interview. before he hires me? Why is it that men are only interested in foreplay when it comes to business? Grace. charmed. Karen. appalled. Hel. honey. Iove you like a cold sore. Ah. she's sweet. Okay where's the waiter? - I want to start celebrating. - There's nothing to celebrate. I'm canceling the meeting with Lilienfield. - What? Honey. why? - Because I'm not gonna get the job. I mean. it's-- it's Helena Barnes. and I'm Grace Adler. I mean. she's an international design goddess! And I'm Grace Adler. Come on. do you really think that? You really think she's better than you? I can't afford Louis Vuitton. and her dog poops in it. All right. I shouldn't do this. but come on. I'm gonna take you somewhere that's gonna make you feel a whole lot better about yourself. Oh. Karen. I don't wanna go to the pharmacy for another one of your test drives. Come on. not there! Move it. move it! Make it sing! Get it! Oh my God. Will. We are gonna make so much money. I'm already eyeing a manse in the Hamptons. It's three manses down from the Puffy-Lopezes. Hmm it's been a while since you've had three manses in the Hamptons. You do realize this is just a meeting with investors. There's no guarantee they're gonna come through with the money. although I must say. they'd be crazy if they don't. What? Do you have to go sissy again? You believing in me being my business partner. - Who's my hero? - Oh! Who's my hero? You are the wind beneath my tush. Well. Iet's not delve into that one too deeply. Now. I thought we'd start by you talking - about how you first came up with-- - No. no. no. You do the talking. That's what you're good at. See. you're the quarterback. I'm just the slutty cheerleader with the nice rack. All right. Well. if you feel like chiming in-- No. no. no. I won't. - Will. - Hey. - Good to see you. - Bob. always a pleasure. - This is my partner. Jack McFarland. - Hello. Jack. Well. everybody take a seat. I think we're ready to start. - Gentlemen-- - Introducing the Subway Tush! - Jack! -  Hey. mon frère lf your derrière could use a little cush No need to pout. the word is out It's Jack's Subway Tush! Taco Time? What are we doing at Taco Time? And-- wait. did you bring that drink from the restaurant? What is this. Vegas? - Look. Karen-- - Hey. forget it. Red! Don't call me by my real name. Call me by my alias. "Anastasia Beaverhausen." I wanna be incognito. Why? Who could possibly know you here? I don't know. Hmm. the Duchess of York. What? Why would the Duch-- oh my God. it's Fergie! Do you think that Weight Watchers knows about this? What is going on here? ( sighing ) Taco Time is a guilty pleasure for some of the ladies in my circle. Nobody questions it. Nobody talks about it. Okay. but why are we here? Come on. Grace. It's like it says in the Bible: "The best way to make you feel good is to make someone else look bad." And nothing looks worse than a socialite shoveling a couple of Taco Gigantes down her gullet. - Are you trying to tell me that Hel-- - Over there. honey. The slob in the dark glasses. Are you sure that's her? Paxil. if you are not going to finish that. Mummy will. All right? Very well. then. It's mine! When is she gonna come up for air? And she's-- I mean. my God! Oh. Anastasia. this is the best gift you've ever given me! Don't kid yourself. honey. I didn't do it for you. Helena took our slip at the yacht club. and drilling a hole in the bottom of her boat just didn't turn my crank the way I thought it would. It is amazing how long Rosario can stay underwater though. Thanks. Iadies! You've been a great crowd! Love ya! Love ya like lovin'! ( kissing ) - Nice. Nice work. - Really? Yeah. Rip Taylor would've been proud. Uh. Jack. can I speak with you for a moment? Sure. - Have a seat. - Oh. First of all. I just wanna tell you that we really love your product and we're prepared to back you 100%. Oh my God! You wanna put everything you've got into my Tush? Well. that's not the way legal would put it. but yes. This is great! Oh my God. I can't wait to tell Will! Oh. yeah. about that. We want him out. Oh. he is. Everybody knows. No. I mean "out" as in "out." What? It's just that your presentation was so dynamic. but then Will kept interrupting to talk about thinking small and slow growth. that's not the direction we wanna take. We'd like him gone. So. what are you saying? You expect me to sell out my business partner and best friend of 13 years for a scrap of foam rubber and a few measly shekels? How dare you. sir? How dare you? This is what we are prepared to offer. He'll be gone by tomorrow. - Hey. Will. - Hello. Jack. - Whatcha reading? - A book. - Would I like it? - No. there's nothing to color in. Look. I spoke to the investors after you left today And? And there's something I should tell you. - Sit down. - I am sitting down. Okay. you don't have to bite my head off! They said. um they said they need to think about it. They need to think about it. - Yeah. - Okay. Let me explain what that means. That means "no." And do you know why they're saying no. Jack? Because of you. - Will. I don't think-- - Exactly! You don't think! I mean. first you start with that ridiculous song-and-dance number. with  Hey. mon frère, with your derrière Could use a little-- thpp. What the hell is that?! - You said to chime in. - Yes. but by "chime" I did not mean "The Bell of Saint Mary." - Will. Listen-- - No. then-- then you bend over in front of Lawrence Weber. a grandfather of four and a large contributor to the Republican National Committee. and ask him to squeeze your happy heinie! Hey. I got a vibe from him. but that's a whole 'nother story. And to top it all off. you produce this-- this sad. obscene thing. this butt puppet. Buttford happens to be our spokes-puppet. You stole Grace's pantyhose. drew a face on them. and then addressed people with it. They were laughing. You turned a meeting with my colleagues into Circus-O-Gay! All of this adds up to the fact that we're not gonna get any financing. because people do not generally give large sums of money to crass. juvenile performing monkeys! Then how come they want me and not you? Because l-- what? Yeah. that's right. They said you think too small. They want you out. They liked my vision. they liked my energy. they liked my passion. And they liked Buttford! They sent me here to fire you. So now who's the monkey. huh? Hi. I need some advice. Did you just walk across the hall like that? No. Actually. I put my bra on when I got to the door. 'cause I know how my girly parts embarrass you. I can handle it. I watch "Animal Planet." Okay. I need help here. I've got my meeting with Lilienfield this afternoon. So do I go smarty turtleneck. hmm? Or bold cleavage blouse? - Well. they're both fine. - Fine? I don't know. Whichever one you like better. What?! Will. what is the point of having a gay best friend. if you're not gonna dress me? What's wrong with you? It's just this whole Subway Tush thing. I didn't even want to get involved in the first place. as you may recall. I was trying to be a good friend. so I went to all the trouble of setting up all these meetings with these investors. and the whole thing blows up in my face. I just-- Jack sold me out. I'll tell you that. Will. I-- I think he's more than made it up to you. - What? How? - He's resigning. - He's what?! - Yeah. I spoke to him this morning. I called him. 'cause-- I know this sounds crazy. but I was missing all these pantyhose. and I thought he might've taken them. I was wrong. But anyway. that's-- that's what he told me. He's resigning? I don't-- why would he do that? He said because he loves you and he's your friend and he doesn't wanna do it without you. In fact. I think he's doing it right now. Oh. my God. I-- he-- he can't do that. I love that he wants to. but his Tush means everything to him. - I can't let this happen. - Wait a minute. Wait. wait! Hey. hey! - What about me? - Oh this with this. change the lipstick. hair up and here are your hose. So without Will. you guys don't get Jack. - In conclusion. gentlemen. I resign. - Stop saying that. You cannot resign from a project you've already been forcibly removed from. You stole this idea. Look. when you say it like that. of course it's gonna sound bad. You told us you had a patent on this product. when in fact. the idea of the Subway Tush belongs to a Mr. Bjorn Stevenson. Hey. he said he was moving back to Sweden. Then again. he also said he could bench-press my weight. which led to a very painful breakup. I don't think you understand. We're seriously considering legal action. I know you are. but what am l? Gentlemen. please stop. Hey! I know what's going on here and I'm not gonna let it happen. I urge you. do not to accept this man's resignation. - He's only doing it out of love for me. - Will-- No. don't. Please. Jack. Iet me say this. When you have the opportunity to go into business with someone like Jack. you don't let that slip through your fingers. - Will. Iisten-- - Jack has passion. He has vision and most of all Jack has originality. There is not an idea in this man's head that is not fresh. unique-- - Shut up. Will. I stole the idea. - What? Apparently. the Subway Tush is not his idea. It belongs to what I've ascertained is an ex-lover of Swedish extraction. You stole this from Bjorn? - What about edible bike shorts? - Jack. Come on. 10 miles into the ride. you get hungry. there's a snack right there on your leg! - All right. How we doing. honey? - I'm good. My pantyhose have a smiley face on 'em. but I'm ready to go. Terrif. Now listen. She's gonna come in here and act all superior. - but don't you let her intimidate you. - I won't. Good girl. Now. I'm gonna go look at an island. but remember if you start thinking Helena is something special. just picture that albino rat of hers licking molé sauce off her mug. Got it? Got it. Thank you. I'm ready. - Medusa! - Medea. Well hello. again. I must say I'm surprised to see you here. Well. I'm up for the job as well. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Oh. Well. may the best designer win. - Ha! Not if I have anything to say about it. You're a strange girl. aren't you? Why do the British always insult you and then ask you to agree with them? Maybe because we think that you Americans are just a little bit silly. don't you think? - Helena! Hello. - Robert. How are you? I'm so sorry to keep you waiting. I guess I was just saving the best for last. Oh. Robert. stop. - So what have you been up to? - Oh. what haven't I been up to? Beijing. Bora Bora. Budapest-- oh. by the way. Curtis and Denise send their love. They thought the Steuben menorah was fabulous! And I must say I agree. Oh, Helena, you always say the right thing. And you must be Grace Adler? Did you have any trouble finding the place? She eats tacos! Lots of tacos! Big. honking. greasy ones with extra cheese and guac. and they drip on her fancy clothes. She thinks no one knows. but-- ( laughs ) Oh. they know. all right! Yeah! Miss Snooty Pants is a taco eater! So now who do you wanna hire? Well. I don't know. Let me see your book. Book? Listen. honey. I know you're feeling a little down about what happened. - but. hey. Iook on the bright side. - What bright side? Well. It's just an expression. honey! I can't believe it. I made a fool of myself. I forgot my book. I blew a job. My God. this is the best freaking taco I've ever had. Grace. darling. that was a delicious performance you gave today. So delicious in fact. that I've decided to pick up your tab. Thanks. especially since it was Iike $2.50 for the both of us. - Anastasia. - Endora. Hey. mon frère. if your derrière Could use a little cush -  No need to pout -  The word is out It's Jack's Subway Tush! I really mean it It's Jack's Subway Tush! I'll tell ya. Daddy It's Jack's Subway Tush! Get out. - For real? - ( laughs ) Yeah. get out. ( theme music playing )   
                




                    			Melanie Weaver is getting married? I went to college with her. What does it mean when lesbians are getting married before me? - Look at that. I'm five for five. - What's that? It's this test. the five pillars of happiness. Supposed to determine the level of contentment in your life. And it comes with a lotion sample. so you know it's scientific. I can't believe you would evaluate your life based on something in the Lifestyle section. Okay. that was obligatory. Bring it on. The first pillar is health. I gave myself a big yes. 'cause I just had my physical. Everything's where it's supposed to be. I'm running every day. and well. Iook at those calves. It's like my knees swallowed a grapefruit. Your turn. I think I'm hypoglycemic. I'm always tired and I can't poop. I would give that a "no." Okay. pillar number two is family. - That's a big yes. You? - Well. Let's see. My mother's idea of bonding is making me scratch her back. and for my last birthday. my father gave me gum. That's another "no" for Grace. Moving on. Iove life. - Another "no" for Grace. - Excuse me! No. you can mark that "yes." thank you. Josh and I are doing great. I mean. it's not perfect. but we care about each other very much. Grace? Hey. what are you doing? You left an hour ago to get bagels. Here. Toast 'em up. I'll be back in 15. Okay. honey. Uh. your laundry is almost done. Well. you get a "no" on love life. too. Actually. I haven't told you this yet. but there's this lawyer. Alex. We've only had one date. but I'm already seeing and his-and-his SUVs in my future. Yeah. yeah. okay. Next. Okay. pillar number four. friendships. - Okay. now we're talking. - No. no. no. no. Note the "s." Friendships. They're talking more than just you and me. This test sucks. And the final pillar is work. I love my job. I work with a lush who insults me. Okay. final tally is Will. Dee-de-de-lee-dee-dee Grace. Waa-waa-waa. You're not that happy. I've known you a very long time. There's always something bugging you. Come on. think hard. - What is rotten in your life? - I don't know. My life is-- okay. actually. there is something. I don't like how you've stopped having lunch with me at my office. You know why that is. I hate the view. Really? I thought it was because you hated Ben. That's what I meant. the view of Ben. Okay. I'll tell you what. We'll have him over. I'll make dinner. and all you have to make is nice. Think you can do that? - I can make nice. - All right. I'm always nice. - Sweetie. the bagels are ready. - Call me when they're cream-cheesed. - Love you. - Uh-huh. ( theme music playing ) And Cook. Iisten. tell Butler to tell Gardener to stay out of my kitchen If he wants a snack he can root around the terrace for grubs and berries like the rest of the help. Now get back to work. Hey Care Bear. Something's bothering me. Can we talk? Sure. honey. Hey. are you wearing make-up? Nothing. really. just a little man-tan. - Your eyelashes look good. too. - Thanks. I'm wearing individuals. I'm concerned. Um does Rosario seem different to you? Come to think of it. she sent me to work today with a juice box. I guess that means Mason went to school with a thermos full of Stoli. She's distant. she's distracted. She's getting a little handsy in her sleep. Last night. she rolled over and shook hands with Master Harold and the Boys. And let me tell you. they were not amused. I know. honey. but listen. it's been my experience that when problems arise between husband and wife. one should never point the finger of blame because it's always the husband's fault. I know what it is. Doilet-toilet. I forgot our anniversary. How insensitive of me. This is my wife. my significant otra. That's good. honey. Why don't you just run home right now and tell her how much she means to you? I would. but I have a date with Fernando. Oh. Well. then. why don't you pick up a little something. and bring it to her tonight? Something she'd love. Iike pork or Tinactin. No. not that. It has to be a more meaningful gift. I don't know. what's the traditional first anniversary gift? Ooh. well. Iet me try to remember. For my first anniversary. I got a million dollars in cash. Paper. it's paper! Paper? Paper is so blah. Let me tell you. when the gays can get married. that's the first thing that goes. So we're at this dim sum restaurant downtown. - and they have this thing called bao-- - Yes. I know what bao is. I spent the summer at the Culinary lnstitute in Hong Kong. Personally. I prefer har gow. - Okay. not the point of the story. - Will: Anyway so she decides to have some fun with the waiter. so she says. "What are these white puffy things?" And he says "Bao." So. I do. - "Okay. but what are they called?" - Bao. - "Okay. but what are they called?" - Bao! She did it like five or six times. ( Will and Grace laughing ) It was a very funny story. I guess the humor was derived from two things: One, that the two words sounded the same; two. that you made fun of someone who doesn't speak English very well. Funny people think it's funny. Really? How would you know? You know what. Benjamin? What do you want me to say. bow wow? All right. all right. all right. all right. all right. all right. Don't make me turn this car around or we're going home without ice cream! (phone rings ) Hello. Hi. Alex. I was just thinking about you. Okay. I wasn't. but I certainly am now. Let me take this outside. ( laughs ) - It bugs you. doesn't it? - What? When you're not the center of attention? It kills you. I can tell. - You think so? - Mmm. I know you. Ben. You're so focused on yourself and your whole Ben Doucette thing. But do you ever think of anyone else? Have you ever stopped to ask someone else what's up? What's up. Grace? No. I don't think so. that's not gonna work with me. We're talking about you. All right. fine. What do you want to know? How about something real? Something that doesn't involve the words "Porsche." "beach house" or "what's-her-name?" Mmm. Okay. something real. Well. I've been married twice-- first to the love of my life. who died 10 years ago. then to a woman who reminded me of my first wife. but was. I found out. nothing like her. I have two beautiful kids. one who's crazy about me and one who's not. And somehow. driving my Porsche to my beach house with what's-her-name. doesn't quite make up for the fact that the things I really want in my life are exactly what's missing from it. Wow. Is that true? All but the Porsche part. I drive a Mercedes now. S-Class. Any more questions. Grace? Um how's the lamb? I made it. you know? It's really good. Grace. It's good. Date number two is set. The romance pillar is a little firmer-- Iet me rephrase that. Uh-oh. Grace. you didn't tell the irregular pantyhose story. did you? There was something in the air tonight The stars were bright. Fernando. What? ( sighs ) You know what? Who needs brains when you can lick your own eyebrows? Why did you give the flowers to the womens? You like the mens. 'Nando. Poor naive 'Nando See Rosario married me to get a Green card. But as long as I'm married to her I get a platinum card. a Barney's card and a Hallmark card that says "Welcome to Easy Street". So I gotta keep the little women happy. Now let me just give these to my wife. and then we'll go make out. - Okay. - Okay. Cha Cha. what are you doing home? I thought you had a date with Dennis. ( mocks spitting ) Not till 10:00. Anyway. Rosie. um I know you're upset because I forgot our anniversary. but I'm just hoping that this will make up for it. Oh. so sweet. And since paper is the traditional first anniversary gift Oh. Bounty. Now I can cross it off my list. Happy anniversary. Rosebud. Don't wait up. Is it safe? My husband's gone. but I would not say that it is safe. my little cup of crema de cacahuates. Rosie. can I have some cash-- Jennifer Love Hewitt! What the hell is going on here?! What can I say. chica? The heart wants what it wants. But you and Gardener? We're in love. We want to get married. Well. I guess it's clear. I'm the only one in this relationship who values the sanctity of marriage. Come on. Fernando! Mr. Zamir? - Mr. Zamir! - What? What? - What are you doing? - Nothing. I was walking my dog. - What dog? - Uh. where did he go? ( makes kissing sounds ) Doggy. doggy. doggy. Doggy. doggy. doggy. You were hunched over. reading a personal card to Grace. I would never do something like that. It is wrong. I'm glad you realize that. So. she has slept with a guy with named Ben last night. Let me see that. Uh. that's a filthy note. but also tender and gentle in spots. That Ben is a smooth operator. Grace and Ben? - Hey. - Will. what are you doing? I was helping Mr. Zamir look for his dog. I don't have a dog. You and Ben? Hey. you're the one who wanted us to make nice. We did. We made nice. Twice. You are unbelievable. You're the second guy to tell me that in the last 12 hours. Come on. Iaugh. Grace. he's my boss. Obviously. I didn't plan this thing with Ben. It just happened. It was just this wild chemical. "ripping off of a pair of $50 panties" kind of thing. Thank you. Grace. That'll go next to the visual of my grandmother getting out of the tub. Don't make me feel bad about this. Ben's a great guy. Besides. you have all five pillars of happiness. Let me have this one. But my boss? I mean. did you stop for one minute to-- you know what? I'm not gonna do this. This is your life. your decision. Enjoy it. Oh. Will. the passive-aggressive gay man. it's been done. No. no. no. no. This is relaxed fit gay man. I'm serious. I'm making a whole new choice with this conversation. See Ben. Honestly. it's fine. All right. I'm gonna take you at your word. because I do want to keep seeing him. Good. Terrific. have fun. Just leave me out of it. Last thing I need in my life right now is somebody else's drama. My wife is cheating on me! My life is ruined! Will. help me! Enter the drama queen. exit the neighbor. Can you believe this? She wants to divorce me and marry Gardener. I'm out on the street! That's shocking. Is there any way you can tell me about this without screeching like a howler monkey? You know what? I don't need you! I have plenty of friends who would be more than happy to help me through this! Goodbye! You don't even pretend to leave anymore. do you? This is serious. Will. I am about to lose everything. and I have a dog and a bird to support. Jack. it was a sham marriage. What are you going to do? Take Karen to court and demand she keep you in the lifestyle to which you've become accustomed? I'm not talking about-- I don't-- can I really do that? Mr. Doucette said that you should review the Blumen file. - Where is it? - I don't know. ask his assistant. - You are his assistant. - I just said I didn't know. Wow. is that your fun side? I'm just asking. 'cause I wouldn't want to miss it. ( sighs ) ( romantic jazz music playing ) - ( Grace laughs ) - You should consider yourself lucky. Why is that? 'Cause I get about $500 an hour for the work I do at this table. That's it? I wouldn't get out of bed for $500. Really? Will you take a check? All right. you either said something very romantic. or you called me a prostitute. - Whatever. sounded good. - Yeah. How you doing. Truman? Hi. Will. What can I do for you? Oh. I was just looking for the Blumen file. but hey. Mr. Blumen can wait. One more day in a Turkish prison never hurt anybody. Okay. okay. I'll get it for you. It's in my office. - You want to cut in? - Uh. - No. thank you. I'd rather not. - Aw. come on. cut in. This lady's gotta dance. See you later. sweetheart. You too. Grace. Oh. please. with the look. How many times did I have to watch you and Michael do "Summer Loving" from "Grease"? That wasn't a look. I was just looking at your skirt. Shouldn't you be on the dashboard of a cab. going It's amazing. you know. when things are working in the relationship department. all those other pillars just fall into place. Me and my family are getting along. - I'm loving my job again. - Yeah. what about your health? Health's better too. but that's not Ben. that's bran. Hello. Karen. Hello. Grace. I am here on business. Oh. great. Put me down for two boxes of the Thin Mints. Okay. different business. Damn. now I want a cookie. Okay. I'll be back. This is in regard to the very tragic and devastating collapse of my marriage to Rosario. It's the laughter you'll remember. honey. Let's go buy make-up. And even though one could never put a price on the pain and suffering this has caused me. one has. Jack. I don't read. I'm read to. Very well. Item one. $500.000 paid to me by you over the next four years. preferably in 50s. Item two. A Shetland pony dyed powder blue to match my eyes. Item three. powder blue eyes. - Item four-- - Wait a minute. wait a minute. Blanche! I'm still on item one. Yeah. I've always been turned on by one Benji Franklin. He wasn't afraid to wear his hair up and away from the face. Franklin's on the 100. you mook. And where do you get off asking me for 500K? Do you know how many times I had to ( pants ) "Oh my God. Stan!" ( screams ) to get that? Well. we did have a contract. I gave you a year of my life so Rosario could stay in the country. I don't think a trust fund and a Corvette is too much to ask for. Are you kidding me with this? I plucked you out of a 4x4 hovel above a blinking light in Times Square. and I put you in a 6x6 maid's quarters on Park Avenue. - and this is the thanks I get?! - ( gasps ) Hey. you got something out of this too. Missy. Who read "Valley of the Dolls" to your kids every night? Who distracted Stan for you on Oyster Tuesdays? Me. It was me. Now I want my 500.000 in 50s! You know. you should think very carefully about what you're asking for. Miss Gurley Brown. You've got a good thing going here. and if you think that you can just shamelessly siphon cash off a loved one Iike I'm doing with my husband. you've got another thing comin'! I want my money. You ain't getting 88 cents from me. Rose. Very well. I will see you in court. By the way. your boobs look great today. It's a custom-made Jean Claus. came in from Paris yesterday. Get outta here! And at that point. the arbitrator will hear your side and Karen's side. and then he'll render his decision. But Jack. you've got to be more reasonable in your demands. You can't. for instance ask for all of Karen's camisoles. Why do you want them anyway? For Halloween. Me and 12 of my gym buddies want to go as an East Side brothel. And you will never get this amount of money. I know it was a little excessive. but then just get me enough for the essentials. okay? Like food. clothing and bikini waxes. Well. that was good. That way we all win. ( phone rings ) Hello. Alex. hi! I'm so sorry about last night. I couldn't get out-- Tomorrow brunch? I will be there. I will absolutely be there. Okay, bye. Jack. he's straight and married. Yeah. so I am. - (jazz music playing ) - Oh. good. Grace is here. I'm gonna go tell her about Alex. Oh. you gotta go tell your wife about your boyfriend. ( Jack blows a raspberry ) Spooky. What? When you said that. you looked just like a woman. Gracie. good news-- oh. you're not Gracie. And this is not good news. (phone rings ) Hello. Hey, it's Alex. Where are you? Ooh. were we having brunch today? I thought we were having brunch on your birthday. Today is my birthday. Ooh! I've got to break some really bad news to a friend of mine. Is there any way we could reschedule your birthday? 'Cause you seem more like a Libra to me anyway. Okay, Will, why don't youjust tell me now? You're actually a straight married man with three kids who has no intention ofdating me again. Nothing could be further from the truth. Morning. sweetie. Oh my God. is that bacon? I love you. I love you. I love you. Alex I'll call you back tonight. I'm so sorry. What's going on? Bacon. pancakes. You put a chocolate chip smiley face on them this would be the meal you make to cheer me up. But I don't need cheering up. Ask me Why. Okay. here's a hint. Check the outfit. You picked up a shift at Long John Silver? I'm going yachting. Yes. that's right. I yacht now. But you're Jewish. Hello? Have you ever heard of a little boat called the Ark? Did I mention that it's Ben's yacht? - Now about Ben. - Oh. thanks I should Carbo load drinking Martinis and having sunscreen applied to your back really takes it out of you. Remember when you first met Ben how you really. really hated him? Yeah. now I really. really like him. You know what else I really. really like? Bacon. Where you hiding it chief? Remember how you said he was slick and slippery and you wouldn't trust him as far as you could throw The Commish? I guess I was wrong. Gosh Will. it is so great to date a guy who's grown up. Who's secure with who he is. who isn't emotionally needy. Who owns a big ass yacht. I don't know. you are a pretty good judge of people. You hated Dr. Laura long before the rest of the world did. - Okay. taking these to go. - What? Why? I'm not gonna let you do that thing where you chip away at a guy I'm dating. I start to question and we break up and then I'm back to flirting with the manager at Blockbuster again. I'm just trying to Just try to be happy for me okay. that's what friends do. Friends don'tjudge and friends don't criticize. And most importantly friends do not let me leave the house Iooking like the little boy on the Cracker Jack box. My God. what the hell were you thinking? Will. I need to see you for a moment. Great. I need to see you too. - Can I get you anything else? - No thanks. I'd like a Diet Coke. no ice. I'd like a date with Denzel. but that's not gonna happen either. Ben. I'm in an awkward position here. I know. so I'm gonna make this easy for you. This inappropriate behavior is gonna stop immediately before someone gets hurt. Wow. I couldn't agree more. Good. I'm glad we talked about this. - Yeah. so you'll stop. - Why would I stop? I'm not the one representing Jack against our client. Karen Walker. No. you're the one who's cheating on Grace. - Is that what we're talking about? - Yeah. Then why are we still holding hands? Will. I really don't see where this thing with Grace is any of your business. Really? Give me a second. My boss plus my best friend divided by chippy on the table-- yeah. that comes out to my business. Check your math. You work for my business. A business which bills seven figures a year. from Walker. Inc. So if you're gonna be representing anybody. you're gonna be representing them. - No. I'm not. - Yes. you are. - No. I'm not. - Yes. you are. No. I'm not! You know. it's kind of ironic. between us. and this is the way we argue. - And yes. you are! - No. no. no! Forget it. You want to talk about conflict of interest. that's one thing. but I am not going down that road again where you pit me against one of my friends. Will. I hate to reopen an old discussion. but yes. you are! So basically. you're taking my two best friends. screwing over one of them and telling me I have to screw over the other. It's amazing. all this screwing. you'd think somebody would be happy. Here's your problem. Will. You've let your personal life interfere with your business life. Now. I take some responsibility here. After all. I am schtupping your best friend. But you have to set boundaries. You know what? You're absolutely right. and I'm about to set a very big boundary. I quit. - No. you don't. - Oh. yes. I do. Jack: There's something I need to tell you. Mommy and Daddy. well. we've decided to live apart. Now. this doesn't mean we don't love you. In fact. it was because of you that we stayed together as long as we did. But in this crazy. mixed up world. how long can a marriage between a Salvadoran maid and a West Village singer-actor-dancer-choreographer last? ( parrot squawks ) It's not your fault. okay? It's not anyone's fault. But. Iet's face it. Mommy's a whore. Mommy cheated on Daddy and Mommy's going to hell. Hey. poodle. What the hell are you doing here? Isn't it enough you destroyed me in arbitration today? You have to come and gloat over your victory? Oh. Jack. I wouldn't do that. You know I can't hide anything from you. You've got nothing. nothing! ( laughs. grunts ) Yeah. Go ahead. Iaugh. Laugh at my pain. but I'll be the one who laughs last. - No. you won't. - No. I won't. Yeah. but really. is there anything I can do to make you feel better? You could apologize. Oh. I don't want to set a precedent. but. Iisten. I'll tell you what I will do. On your way out. Security Guard is gonna frisk you to make sure you didn't take any silverware. Hateful! I should haul you back to court for slander! Karen. Who let you in? - Your butler. - Huh. you mean ex-butler. Speaking of exes. you know what's nice? Being your ex-lawyer. Yeah. not having to kiss your ass and pretend you're interesting is gonna free up a lot of my time. I might even learn a language. Honey. if you look inside this bag. I'm giving you a little sign language right now. - Hey. Jack. - Oh. hey. Will. hi. I just want to thank you so much for your fine work at arbitration today. Yeah. it was so nice. Oh. wait a minute. That wasn't you. That was the opposing counsel. I'm sorry. I just have a lot on my mind and my life is in a very weird place right now. Well. Boo Radley-hoo. Iady. My freaking world is collapsing. Then why did you bring a date to your divorce hearing? "I bored. Yack. Iet's go get a grape juith." - 'Nando is my rock. - ( sighs ) And when we're at a better place. I have stuff to tell you. It's like the man does not have hamstrings. But back to the point. I am out on the street and it's all your fault! I'm sorry. children. I don't want you to see Daddy cry. - ( parrot squawks ) - ( Jack crying ) Jack. I'm sorry. How can I help? What can I do? Can two gay men share an apartment without driving each other crazy? - ( parrot squawks ) - ( dog barks ) Probably not. You know. it's not the Four Seasons. but since life has given me lemons. I will drink your lemonade. With crushed ice. please. Okay. time to lay down a few ground rules. Ooh, good idea. First rule. if the pad's rocking. don't come a'knocking. That's a good rule. but I was thinking more like. you take your bags and your menagerie. Laura. and take them into the back room. and I won't smother you in your sleep. Still waiting on that limonada. Well. while you're waiting. just make sure that Claus doesn't make a urinada on the floor. - I gotta go talk to Grace. - Oh. Will. Iook. quick thought. The back bedroom's kinda small. How about every six months we switch rooms? Hey. how about every two months. you and the bird switch heads? - Hi. Hi. - Hi. Hi. Is this too sexy for the symphony? - Uh. probably. - Good. Be a shame if the only overture I got tonight was from Gustav Mahler. - Get it? Classical humor. - Yeah. it was very good. Somewhere. Beverly Sills is chortling into her cleavage. Look. there was something I was trying to say yesterday. and I didn't and I think I should say it now. Sounds important. It is. so I'm just gonna say it. I know you like Ben. but he's not the guy you think he is. Sweetie. he's cheating on you. He's seeing someone else. - Hi. - Hi. - You ready to go? - Uh-huh. You look beautiful. ( kissing ) I'm gonna find a vase and put these in some water. Ooh. Will. I am getting a lot of stuff. If you'd like. Iater. I can sit with you and teach you some calming pranayama. - You were saying? - Ben's seeing someone else. which may not have quite the impact I thought it would a moment ago. Oh. yeah. you mean that chick with the Macy Gray hair? So. you're okay with this? Sure. why wouldn't I be? Well. because he's seeing someone else! And so am l. and so is Josh-- some girl with armpit hair. named-- ugh. what is it again? Hon. what's her name again? Pond? River? - Ocean. - Ocean. God. the guys I'm dating date such losers. Okay. who are you? You're dating two guys. and they are seeing other people. This is not your life. You're not gay or French. I know. isn't it great? I'm naughty. I'm dating two guys at the same time. My mother would so not approve. I can't wait to tell her. Well. that's-- that's great. I-- I just quit my job over this. but that's great. - What? - I quit my job! Oh my God. no! No. you can't! Hey, we better get going. My electric car only has Look. this is just a huge misunderstanding. I'll talk to Ben and I'll straighten the whole thing out. Come on. honey. Tick-tock. Okay. we'll work this out. You worry about me too much. mister. So. you sound tall. How tall are ya? I don't know, six t-- is Will there? Jack! Alex. I've not forgotten about our date. I'm running a little bit behind. but I will definitely-- Is that guy living with you? - Yeah! - No! It's a long story. You know what? I think I'm done with your long stories. In fact, l-- I think I'm done with you. No. no. Alex. come-- don't hang up. Don't t-- Goodbye. I blew it. I'm sorry. I know you're hurting. buddy. Thank God I'm here. He sounded cute. You think he'd like me? Uh. that was insensitive. I'm sorry. You probably need a couple hours to mourn. Remember. black is slimming. Okay. we plugged the car into a Chinese restaurant so I can give you five more minutes. Are you okay? I don't know. Let's ask the Lifestyle section. huh? Love life. gone. Job got in the way. Job. gone. Friend got in the way. Health. something's in the way. I may have to borrow some of that bran. And friends Okay. okay. I get it. And I'm so sorry 'cause I know a lot of this is my fault. but-- but trust me. I will make it better. I don't think so. I-- I don't think you can. I think this is something I need to fix myself. What are you talking about? We don't fix ourselves. That's not what we do. I fix you. you fix me. So. this is what we're gonna do. Tomorrow. it's all about Krispy Kremes. blender drinks and more Krispy Kremes. So. by the time we're fighting over the last honey glaze. everything will seem so much better. No. it won't. I don't think a sugar buzz. a morning drunk and a stomach ache is gonna do the trick this time. I need a change. I-- I need something different. You always say that. and you're always wrong. Trust me. I will take care of everything. ( Will sighs ) I got to go. but everything is gonna be okay. Right? - Sure. - Sure. I'll see you later. ( shower running ) Sorry I'm late. A horrible thing happened on the way from the donut place-- three and half of 'em disappeared. Make that four. What are you yammering about? I wasn't yammering to you. Erykah Ba-don't. I was yammering to Will. Well. you're gonna have to yammer a whole lot louder. Will's gone. Left on a jet plane. - What? - Yeah. she's exhausted. Her life. Iike her hair. had become unmanageable. - Where did he go? - Uh, some island. I couldn't really make it out. I was in there watching the "Creek." But-- but he-- no. no. No. no. he would never leave without telling me. We didn't do the chicken dance so the plane wouldn't crash. No. he would never do that. That would be totally unlike him. Well. maybe that's why he did it. But he-- oh my God. And since this is my apartment now. we have a few new ground rules. Rule number one. if the pad's rocking. don't come a knocking. And rule number two. the pad will always be rocking. Okay? Will's voice: Day one. What have I done? I quit myjob, I left my home, my friends. I'm all alone in the middle ofnowhere. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever done. I kick ass. This is fantastic. And the best part is, no one can reach me, no one can bother me. - Phone call. Will Truman. - What? Hello? Ben. how did you-- never mind. I-- No. I am not coming back. I quit. Leave me alone. Thank you. Okay, people can reach me. But still, this feeling ofremoteness is exhilarating. I'm experiencing for the first time what it means to be completely alone. And you know what? I think I like it. - It's rude to hang up on people. - Ahh! What the hell are you doing here? I didn't hear Tattoo announce you. - How did you find me? - I'm me. I can find people. I hope you like piña coladas. Me. I like getting caught in the rain. I don't care if you like making love at midnight. I'm not coming back. Coming back? What makes you think I even want you back. - You just said so on the phone. - Hear me out. We have a client who is in a bit of a dicey tax situation. and-- - mm. mm. mm. - What? It's not for you. It's for me. He wants to start an offshore company. - and this is as good a place as any. - Forget it. Come on. it wouldn't even be like work. Couple of hours a day. the rest of the time you work on your tan. write in your journal. meet guys. There's a place down the road called the Rasta Fairy lnn. I'm assuming that's for you. And the whole tab is paid for by me. Ben. forget it. You're wasting your breath. And by the way. the Rasta Fairy lnn is not a gay bar. It's a head shop. I already checked. Come on. Truman. what's it gonna take? I know there's something out there I can give you. - Come on. name it. - No. - Ask for anything. - No. - Whatever it takes. - No. - Piss me off. - Make me partner. You're pissing me off now. Truman. Nobody makes partner after six months. And I want that corner office. the one that Steve has. Kick him out. He's homophobic and he smells like gin and Hai Karate. I want my name on the letterhead. prettier numbers on my paycheck. and a no dancing policy on my conference table. Where the hell do you get off asking for all this? I know you. Ben. I know you'd never come down here unless you couldn't do this without me. So. the way I see it. you've got two choices. You can either give me what I want. or you can take a plane home. You know. you can be a real jerk when you want to be. Truman. I knew I liked you. Deal. Oh. one more thing. when I get back. when ever that may be. I'd like Mrs. Freemen to treat me a little more politely. Will. there are limits to what I can do. Have a nice vacation - I'll take that drink now. - No. you won't. Yo! Grace: Look at this. Janet Eisenberg. 33. and David Bromberg. It is the second marriage for both. Can you believe that? Uh. I really don't follow straight society. Come on. Jack. it's Sunday morning. We're supposed to go through the paper. You comment on what I read. and then I will comment on what you read. Okay. got a little bit of a problem here. See. you're trying to make me Will. and I'm trying to make you disappear. How about we compromise. and you make me scrambled eggs? Jack. Iook where my foot is. I could scramble a couple eggs from here. Oh. Grace. I'm not like the other men in your life. I will hit you. Bring it on. Nancy. You don't scare me. I'll pull your hair. Do whatever you want. 'cause today I'm handing out lollipops and ass whoppings. and I'm all out of lollipops. - I miss Will. - I do too. I can't believe things were so bad that he had to leave. I just hope he finds what he's looking for. Do you think he left because of me? Yes. I do. You know what. Iets just Iets just try to be really supportive of one another okay. Sure. Is there anything you need from me right now? No I'm okay. Oh. I guess I'm -- is there anything you need from me? Yeah. just your keys. I don't really like you walking in and out all the time. May I help you? - Hello. I'm Will Truman. the attorney. I have a 10:00 appointment. The Mister is not feeling well. We told him goat does not agree with everybody. - But the Missus is right over there. - Thank you. Good morning. Well. well. well. and they say fruit doesn't travel. If anyone's hungry. I made BLTs.   
                




                    			And the guy I'm supposed to have a meeting with is in 2-I, so I say to the doorman, "Excuse me, is there a 2-I in this building? I'm looking for 2-I. He's ignoring me. I must have said "2-I" like 15 times. The guy finally puts down his newspaper, looks right at me, and he only has one eye. You lie. That did not happen. Swear to God he only had one functioning eye, and the other one was like a mini glazed doughnut a sort of congealed Paging new subject. New subject to the white courtesy telephone! So how's the Island? Do you just run around naked all day in war paint chasing things with a pointy stick? Grace It's the Virgin Islands. It's not Fire Island. But yes. Sweetie? I'm still holding the elevator. Are you coming? Oh, I'm--I'm talking to Will. I'll meet you there. Just order me what you're having. Tofu scrambled on a bed of spinach? Yeah. Oh! But, um, uh, instead of the spinach, I'll have chocolate chip pancakes. Oh, hey, oh, oh! Oh! And eighty-six the tofu scrambled. Thanks, sweetie. You're the best. Ok, the thing with Josh is getting very messy. What's the problem? Last time we talked, you and Josh were clicking along. Yeah, but Ben and I are clicking along, too, and it's getting harder and harder to click two guys at the same time. I thought this was the new you. I thought you were making up for the "head gear years." This whole thing has just gotten way too complicated.  I mean, the other night in bed, I called Josh "Ben." to cover it, I stretched it out into bennnd overand I ended up doing something I really never wanna do again. Good thing Ben's name isn't Pee-Wee. Wilma! Get your ass in the steam room asap. Stan has some legal questions. Oh, and he's wearing the shorty robe, so if I were you, I'd pick a point on the wall and focus on it. Grace, I'm sorry. I'm wanted in yet another nude business meeting. No! You do this to me every time we talk. Grace, I would much rather talk to you than avert my eyes while Stan re-adjusts his soft currency, but I gotta go! - Wilma, shift it! - Honey, I'm sorry. Damn it! Thanks. You can just put it on my tab. And you know what? Go ahead and give yourself a big, fat tip. Thank you, Mr., Uh Truman. Will Truman. That's my name Will Truman Hey, Jack. But you can call me Jack.

We we gonna get married in Vermont and adopt Himalayan whistle kids. But thanks to you, I'll be alone until-- Until the pizza boy delivers. And, boy, does he ever! Thanks for the remind. - See you later. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on with you? I haven't seen you around the old spa lately. Jack, just because you lie around there naked doesn't make it a spa. It's a laundry room. What's with the mood and the 'tude? Nothing. It's just It's--it's--it's really not your area. Whaddaya talk? Everything's my area. Unless it's about your lady parts, 'cause that's more Will's area. Come on Well, I've-- Have you ever dated two guys at the same time? Forgive me. It's just that I've been juggling Ben and Josh for a couple of months now, and I think I need to make a decision. Boy trouble? Now you're talkin' Jackanese! Come on. We'll have a steak. You'll pour your heart out. And to top it off, we'll rent a movie. You're into gay porn, right? Who isn't?

Oh, the Island, it was awful. And by awful, I mean Karen. I--I-- And I missed you. I just felt like every time we talked, I wasn't there for you. But I've had plenty of time to consider your latest problem, and I think I have the fix. What problem? You know, your "torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool" thing. Oh! Oh, right. Now, you know I love Ben, but I think in this case you should go with Josh. I mean, yes, he's a little crunchy and groovy. But he adores you, and That's what counts, right? Right. So there's the verdict. Josh is the one you should be with. I am so glad you're back! And I hate to do this, but I have to go. I've got a brunch, and I--I'd move it till later, but then it would be lunch. Yeah. Ok, well.. We'll talk about it later. And, uh Peace out. Yeah. I always feel nervous at customs lines. Even if I haven't done anything wrong, I still feel guilty. I don't know why. Don't worry, honey. Wayne there's my friend. We go way back. Friend Wayne! Where you going? UhWayne! Wayne! Don't go away! Where'd my Waynie just go? UmI shouldn't be telling you this, he's being fired for accepting bribes. Apparently he was letting people smuggle all kinds of stuff in the country-- emeralds, ivory, illegal prescription drugs. What people will do! Honey. Uhsay, is this your 100? No. Must be mine. Why don't you go ahead of me? You look like you've had a hard life. Ohthanks! I've got to tell you I find these toilets that flush themselves very threatening. That's nice, honey. Listen, I've gotta pop over to the duty free and pick up a carton of cigs for the kids. Would you be a peach and carry my bag? - Oh, sure. - Oh. Ok. - I mean, Josh is really-- - Grace, we've been through this already. I'm telling you, Ben is the one you should be with. Right, right. Of course. Besides, there's something about Josh I don't-- I can't put my finger on it. But Will thinks I should dump Ben. Why are you even listening to him? I mean, Will's not thinking straight. Ha ha. You cannot have that much fat sucked out and function normally. I'm telling you, Ben is the way to go. You know what? I think you're right. It feels right. You are so good at this. Who's my good boy? Who's my good boy?! So, what are you reading? Ooh, he's cute. "Texas to execute another inmate." I do love them bad boys. Well, you can read it later when I line your cage with it. Ooh. Barracuda. What crawled up your culottes? Nothing crawled up my culottes. It's just that you're two inches from my ear polluting my brain with your inane ramblings and buzzing through those chips like some queer gopher. All right, I get it. I get it. It's the surgery. You know, Grace told me her mom was a little testy, too, after her first No, no, no. I'm not testy. What are you talking about? Bobbi Adler never had a face-lift. Uh, yes, she did. Grace told me. She told you her mom had a face-lift? Yeah. You didn't know that? Of course I knew that. I just didn't think it was something that she would tell you. If you knew that, then why did you just say you didn't? You know what? Forget it. Just take your crayons and go practice your lower-case letters. Hey, don't go ridin' around on your huffy bike just because Grace tells me things she doesn't tell you. Grace doesn't tell you anything. AhSure, she does. Yeah. We spent a lot of time together while you were away, mister! I bet you I know more about Grace than you do. I am not gonna play that game with you. What's her middle name? That's easy. It's I'm sorry. It's what? It'sja..sam. Did you say julia? Ah, yes, I did. Well, it's not. It's Elizabeth. Because her mother loves Elizabeth Taylor. Well, whoop-de-damn-doo! Doesn't say anything about who she is. - Ok. What was her saddest childhood moment? - I don't know. When she discovered that hamsters can't fly. What was her nickname in junior high? - I don't know. - Gross Adler. What was her first method of birth control? - I don't know. - Prayer. - What does she want name her first daughter? - Ha! It's.. I don't know. Lilly! Ha ha! Spelled with 2 Ls but still pronounced lily. - Lilly. - Yes! It's her great-grandmother's name, it's her favorite flower, and we planted a whole box of them outside her bedroom window while you were away having three of your chins sucked out! But you didn't know that, did you?! Ll-ll-ll-ll! Pfft! This is stupid. Get away from me! Aww! So sad! So pathétique. Poor Will just found himself à pied de terre on la rue de la pathétique. Your mother took the straps off your bed about 20 years too early. How was it? Oh, it was ok. It was mostly business. Stan gave me a monkey, though. Heh heh. Sweet little thing. Bit of a biter. Gave Rosario a nasty little ass hickey! Ha ha ha ha! Oh! Ooh! Ooh! You ok? Uhyeah. Ever since I've been back, I've been getting these shooting pains. Well, have you done anything unusual since you've gotten home? Eaten? Loved? Worked? Well, let me see. We landed. We got our bags. Rosario took the fall for some black pearls I was smuggling. I went home, greeted the kids warmly over the intercom. No. Nothing out of the ordinary. Rosario was arrested? Yeah. She's in a holding cell in Queens! Ha ha ha ha-- Oh-oh-oh! Ooh! Ooh! Wait! Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Because of something you did, Rosario was arrested? Honey, who gives a crap about my maid? My tummy hurts! Have you noticed that every time I mention her name you grab your stomach? What? Whose name? - Rosario. - Ooh! - Rosario. - Ooh! - Rosario. - Ooh! Knock it off! What you're feeling are pangs of guilt. What?! Guilt. Oh, boy. Ok. How am I gonna explain this one? Uhguilt is an emotion that-- Ok. Jumping ahead. An emotion is something that I-- Allons! Come on! I know what guilt is. It's one of those touchy-feely words that people throw around that don't really mean anything You know, like "maternal" or "addiction." Rosario. Go get her out of jail! I'm not going to Queens! There are people living in cabs down there! Let her tunnel her way out! Ok. Fine. Don't get her. I'm sure you'll find someone else who'll clean your house and love your kids and cream Stan's liver spots and Like a puppet on a string. Hey, what are you doing? All my plants died. I told Jack to water them while I was away. But I can see how he might hear that as "fill up my hard drive with Internet porn." What's the matter? Why are you pouting? I'm not pouting. Hey, I watch "Ally McBeal." I know what pouting looks like. You're pouting. I heard you and Jack in your apartment last night. What? So now you're worried that Jack's my new you? Ha! I don't Maybe - Oh, my God. Could you be any cuter? - Grace! Oh, I'm sorry. I just love not being the insecure wreck for once. My feelings aren't cute, ok? I'm not the youngest brother on "Eight is Enough." How can you like Jack better than me? Are kidding me with this? We've been best friends for 15 years. Do you really need me to tell you how much you mean to me? I do it for you like every 5 minutes. No, you don't! Grace, I have to talk you off a ledge every time the Starbucks lady gives me extra foam! Well, clearly there's something going on there. I mean, the two of you have your own language. Grace, it's called a macchiato. All right. What do you want me to say? I don't know! How about something like Like you need me more than anybody else There's no one that could ever take my place And then that, you know, you promise when your last breath escapes you in this earthly life, it will whisper my name. Will. But, you know, in your own words. What does this say to you? That you're out of Skin-So-Soft? The scar, Will. Remember? Oh, right. That's from when your sister was sleepwalking and thought you were a salami. - That's on my thigh. - Right. No. This scar is from junior year when Scott Kelly dumped you. Remember? I jumped on my moped, ran over to your dorm, hit a patch of ice, and flew into that stupid men's singing group. Right. The A Cappellicans. God, they sucked. The point is My love for you is like this scar Ugly but permanent. So as long as this is on my elbow, you've got nothing to worry about. Ok. And you know what else? Ow! What?! What'd you do that for?! Don't you ever leave for the months without telling me. Sorry. Can I say one last thing about Josh? I think you should reconsider. I know he's not as exciting as Ben, but the man loves you. Grace, I have to tell you something right away. Hold on. We're talking. Josh is kind. He's compassionate-- - All the things you've ever said were important to you. - No, no, no. You should break it off with Josh. Jack, you know, Will has a point, so maybe I should just think about Josh a little more. He doesn't. You don't. Dump him. Jack, just because I say one thing doesn't mean you automatically have to take the contrary position. This is about what's best for Grace, and I think-- - I screwed around with Josh. - You should probably go with Ben. What? Yeah, well remember how I said there was something about Josh I couldn't put my finger on? Well I Put my finger on it. Sorry! We had a saying on the Island. Maka maka lana Lana makalui What does that mean? I don't know. I just can't believe you ended up with another gay guy! Oh, honey, what an ordeal. You should be down on your knees giving thanks to Saint Hootchy-Kootchy whatever coconut shell your people pray to that you didn't have to go through that! And while you were busy yapping it up with the she-man of Cell Block H, I was doing double-time at the mans. You know I actually had to read to the kids last night? I didn't know what in hell to do, so I read 'em the warning label on my Dalmane! Oh, God-- Oh, but listen to me goin' on like this. It's terrible! I haven't even given you a chance to thank me for springing you outta Oz! Oh, honey, watch it! My drink! My drink! My drink! Honey! Honey! Honey, honey

Someone just tried to break into my apartment! I was sleeping, and I heard the door jiggle, and then they tried to jam it open! - There's someone out there! - Oh, my god! A-are you all right? Nnno! You stay here, and we'll-- we'll go check it out. Jack, you may wanna grab something heavy. I am so freaked out. I cannot believe someone was trying to break into my apartment. There's probably someone roaming the hallway with my picture in one hand and an axe in the other. Oh, thank you. That feels nice. Who are you? Mipanko. Like the candy treat? And don't worry, Jack has a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. The Navy Seals, they train him for this sort of thing. So, you two are pretty close, huh? As close as two men can get in 11 minutes. Somebody was definitely trying to get in. The doorjamb was messed with. Yeah, but the ball cock is ok. What? Why did you check the toilet? I didn't. I just like saying it. Heh heh All right, well, there's nothing we can do tonight. So, you wanna-- wanna stay here? No. No, I'm not going to be chased out of my own apartment. Then they'll have won. I'm gonna be strong. Will you sleep over with me tonight? Please! Please, please, please-- Why do I only get these offers from women? Ok, all right, all right, all right! Thank you! Who's my hero? Who's my big strong man? I don't know. We'll stay over till he shows up. Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 02 Fear and Clothing synchro by kingo Will? Are you asleep? You kidding? Between the mouth-breathing, and the wheezing, and the sinuses, it's like sleeping with a Sleestak. This breathe-easy strip doesn't work. - Ow!! - Ow!! - What? - Could we talk about your toenails? I'm sorry. I'll cut them. Don't you need them for tree climbing and warding off predators? Shh! Listen! Listen! What's that?! I just heard someone outside! You heard nothing! There's nothing out there, so just-- Oh, my God! - See! - Don't freak out! - I have never freaked out! - Shh! Shh! Stay here. Nothing. It's nothing. We're fine. Did I just scream like a woman? Don't flatter yourself. You scream like a girl. Will, if there had been  someone out there, what would we have done? I don't know. Grate some cheese with your toenails and invite them in for quiche? Come on, let's go back to bed. What? No, no! - I can't sleep here. - Oh! No, I'm too creeped out. No, I--I don't-- I don't feel-- I don't feel good here anymore. All right, we'll go to my apartment. It'd make more sense, anyway. At least this way, we'll get some peace and quiet. Biggly, biggly, biggly, biggly, biggly, biggly, bog! - I win! - Damn! Every time! - What are you doing? - Playing Biggly Bog! Biggly what? Bog. It's like Taggly Dip, but with dice. Look, Grace can't sleep over there, so we're gonna stay-- Why is Mipanko wearing my kimono? Blanche, I think the bigger question is, why do you have a kimono? And how many times have I told you to keep your animals in your room, doctor do-nothing? Shh-shh-shh! Just keep it down. You'll wake up Poppy. Who's Poppy? Mipanko's Poppy, Will. He showed up here in tears. Poppy got in a fight with his parents. It's ok, Poppy. We'll be quiet. Ok. And we close the mouth. - Morning. - Morning. - MRNG. - Morning. Can you imagine if whoever it was had actually gotten in? He probably would've made me rub lotion all over myself so he could make a prairie skirt out of my skin. Karen, I have never been more terrified in my entire life. Oh, honey. Stan bought me a 7-karat ruby on our trip to Paris last year. What does that have to do with the break-in? Nothing, honey. I thought we were just swapping stories. Jeez Louise! Didn't realize it was "All about Grace" day. Oh, there it is. Miss Karen, they were out of Grey Goose, so I got you extra Stoli. Ooh! What's going on here? This doesn't concern you. I'm turning the fridge into a minibar. So what did you bring me, Rosiola? Oh, all your boys are here. Johnnie Walker, Jim Beam, Jose Cuervo, and the 2 Glens, Livet and Fiddich. I think I'm gonna give the boys a shimmy. Whoo! Oh yeaah! Hey, boys! Karen, Karen No. No, no, no, no. No, this is not a hotel. We work here. You cannot have a minibar. Where should I put the giant Kit-Kats? Stick them in the minibar. I've had it, Grace! If you leave the toilet seat down one more time-- Are you two still fighting? What is she doing here? It's 9:45. Shouldn't she be at lunch? What is she doing here? Shouldn't she be at the Westside Y bobbing for boyfriends? - Why are you still doing this? - Hey hey hey! I did her a favor by marrying her maid. And what do I get in return? Nothing! She is dead to me! Nobody tries to soak Karen Walker for half a mil and my bustier collection! She is dead to me, too! You know, this is my office. I had to have Rosario deloused after being married to it! Hello, I'm in the room! Enough! Stop! Not another word from any of you! Suck it-- Ok, enough! All of you, just go off to your corners and just-- be strange! Now! Ahem. Rhymes with witch. I am sorry, but I am just not in the mood to play mediator. I am having the hardest time just feeling safe in my own home. Why? What happened? What are-- What are you doing? It's "Behind the Music" with Mariah Scarey. I am right in the middle of "Rumpole of the Bailey." Don't just grab the remote! I'm sorry. It was very wrong of me. What?! Where did you get that? Ooh, look! This is the part where Mariah pretends not to hate Whitney. Give me that! We are going to watch "Rumpole of the Bailey." Out of my way! Out of my way! They're reattaching a woman's scalp on The Learning Channel! Put it on! Sorry, Grace. Will's watching "Bunghole up my Mainly." It is "Rumpole of the Bailey," and seeing as I have the remotes, that's what we're watching. Grace! Wha You've seen this thing, like, 5 times. I know, but it's hard to watch the whole thing. Each time I watch, I see a little-- Whoa! No, no! We are watching this! - Mariah! - Rumpole. No, no! Just leave it alone! Cut it out already! Wait, what happened? Why is it on "Highway to Heaven?" You broke it! Now it's stuck on Pax TV. That's it! Get out here, both of you! Come on, out! I can't sleep. Y-you've eaten all my food. There's so much hair at the bottom of the bathtub, I swear it's about to ask me if I want a falafel. I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry. I love you both, and I want to help you, but I'm afraid one of you is gonna have to go. Whoa, Cassidy, Cody, enough! I know, I know! You're scared of your apartment, and you're a homo without a home. I know! They're very good arguments, a-and trust me, this is not a decision I'm eager to make, so-- So you make it. Kumquat? You decide who's going to stay and who's going to go. - I'll be back in an hour. - Where are you going? Where every red-blooded American man goes when he needs to blow off steam The sweater department at Bergdorf's. Scissors! Scissors! Scissors! Scissors! Stop doing that! It doesn't work if you do the same thing! - Then stop doing scissors! - You stop doing scissors! - Fine! - Fine! Again. Scissors! Scissors! Scissors! Scissors! You suck at this! Listen, this is no way to decide who's going to stay in this apartment. Let's just be fair. Let's be reasonable. I'm thinking of a number between one and 10. Do you have no respect for me? I'm not gonna play that stupid game. - Just pick a number! - Five. Damn it! You were wrong. Jack, for once in your life, would you stop being so selfish?! I was robbed! My apartment still feels creepy! Oh, shut up, Adler! Your apartment was creepy before you were robbed! You just wanna stay here because this place doesn't smell like bologna and mulch. Well, you're nothing but a leech, McFarland! You just glom on to someone like Karen or Will, and you leech, and you mooch, - and you leech, and you mooch, and you leech-- - Scaredy-cat! - Parasite! - Overbite! Underdeveloped calves! Here you go. I'm here to pick up Stanley Walker's suit. Karen, it's meWill. Oh! Hi, Wilma. I'm sorry. I didn't see you! Silly me. So, could you grab me that suit? I'm kind of in a hurry. Karen, I don't work here. I'm-- Actually, you know what? I'm on my break right now, but the other salesguy'll be back in just a minute. - So, how you doing? - All right. Just doing a little shopping while Grace and Jack-- Buh-buh-buh-buh! Do not say that name to me! He is dead to me! And that one goes to the bottom of the pile. I can't believe you're still mad at him. I clothed and fed that man for a year, and he tried to fleece me. And he didn't even have the decency to put me into an insulin-induced coma first. Are you actually surprised that Jack McFarland took advantage of you? I mean, that's like being surprised  when the counter help at yogurt shop seems sad for no reason. Come on, this is Jack we're talking about. Go on, salesperson Jack is like a-- a puppy. You don't stop loving him because he piddles on the carpet. You just roll up a newspaper and hit him on the snoots. He does have that sweet puppy breath. Yeah. And we both know how much he loves chasing that tail. Here you go. Thanks. I'm really glad we worked things out, Grace. Yeah, me, too. Sorry I bitch-slapped you. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, so guess what? We've come to a decision. Well, good. I figured if I just got out of your way, you'd do the right thing. So, what did you decide? I'm in, Red's out. Well, ok, that's good, that's--that's fine. And you're ok with this? Yeah, I'm gonna have my Aunt Pescha come over and get rid of the evil spirits. Then of course, the problem becomes getting rid of my Aunt Pescha, bu-- And if that doesn't work, then I'll just find another place to live. I mean, we really talked about it, and--and he really does need this more than I do, so-- Plus you lost three straight rounds of thumb wrestling. Ok, not necessary. - So I'm gonna get going. - Yeah. Hey, Will, you know, can you run out and get me some bee pollen extract for my tea? Yeah, it's a little dullsville. Hold that thought. Just wanna try a little experiment. You sit there with that.  And you come here. Yes, much better, much better! W-what's going on? I thought you wanted us to make the choice? I did. I just didn't think you'd pick the wrong choice. May I remind you that I'm your one remaining link to the gay world. Jack, I love you. I'm sorry, but-- For the sake of our friendship, I can't live with you. So you're shutting me out? Is that-- Is that wh-- Mmm, yeah, that tastes good, yeah. All right, fine. You know what? If you need me, I'll be out on the street sleeping in a hat, tissue boxes for shoes, selling figurines of kittens made from scraps of metal and old soup. Hey, Eponine What I had in mind was you sublet Grace's apartment. Or technically, your mom and I sublet Grace's apartment. What do you think? Works for me. Yeah, you'd like that, I'm sure. Yeah, right. Yeah! There's 9 months left on my lease. Wouldn't you like it? Yeah, ok, Grace! Oh, my God, I have my own apartment! All it needs is a little gay spray and a half-dozen torso sculptures, and I'm home! Let's go tell everybody! Exeunt flourish! - So. - Yeah. So we're living together again. Yes, we are. You sure about this? Sweetie I have never been less sure about anything in my life. Oh, thank God! Me, too! - Oh! Hey, poodle! - Hello. Guess what? Good news. We're not mad at each other anymore, because I've forgiven you. Interesting, because I haven't forgiven you. So what's your point? Oh, all right, I'm sorry. There, we're done. Come on, let's go get French tips. Karen, I am not a light switch that you can just apologize to and expect me to forgive you. My emotions are much more complex than that I need time to heal. I don't accept. - You don't what? - I said I don't accept. I don't think you understand what just happened here. The only other person I've ever apologized to was my mother, and that was court ordered. So please accept my apology in the spirit in which it was intended or I'll kick you in the gittles. No! Now be gone before someone drops a house on you! Hey, up yours, Dorothy. May you tan and freckle! Don't mind me. I'm just grabbing my toothbrush and a Balance Bar. Ow! Hey, that looked like it hurt. Yeah, tell me about it! She could be bleeding. That's not funny. You wanna know something else that's not funny? You know, um, yesterday she slipped on some bacon grease in the kitchen, and she missed the counter-top by this much. She could have lost an eye! Last night, Olivia shoved  Butler down the service stairwell, knocked him unconscious! - When did you find him? - Not till this morning! He might need a brace! Oh, Kar, I missed you! Oh, I missed you, too, honey. Wink, wink! I felt so bad, I went out and bought this. - Oh, for me? - No. But we can go buy you a little happy. Come on, let's go to Bergdorf's. - Say, did you know Will works there now? - Get out! and that concludes the "Highway to Heaven" Marathon. Stay tuned for the "Making of the Highway to Heaven Marathon. That was good. Night, Poppy. And   
                




                    			Oh! You see, she's not listening to her caddy. He told her the green was fast. I wish I had a caddy. Somebody who'd tell me about the hazards up ahead and carry my stuff. I think I'm your caddy. Oh, yeah! Now go get me a Fruitopia and my 9 iron. - No, I'm serious. I'm thirsty, move your ass. - Hey, hey, hey! Don't get catty with the caddy. Big news! Joe and Larry have invited us to the South Hamptons for a man-tan reunion. Joe and Larry? You're kidding. - No, it's gonna be wild! - Oh, my God! You remember their last party? Yeah. I got so drunk, all I remember is-- making out with some guy in the hot tub. Oh, my God, so did I! - I don't really remember that. - I don't. Anyways, I'm so excited! Gosh, it's been so many years. I hope I can pull off a thong. Isn't the point of these weekends to pull off someone else's? No, Grace, you can't come. I'm sorry, loving you to Della Reese's pieces, but gay guys only. Remind me to invite Karen. That's fine. As much as I would love a couple of days of lube and Liza-- Iam going to Ben's yacht club this weekend. Wow. The black man is taking the Jewish girl to the Yacht Club. You two are so out, you're in. Bring me a souvenir. Actually, ew! Don't! Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 3 Husbands and Trophy Wives synchro: kingo - Ooh-Ooh! - I can't hear you! Ooh-Ooh! We're here, we're queer Give us a light beer! We're here, we're queer - Give us a light beer! - Shh! Hey, quiet! Hi! Good to see you! Why, uh, why are we whispering? Yeah, if we don't, will we be disciplined? No, no, no. I think you got the wrong idea. Hey, guys! Captain Hornblower! Hello I'm not quite getting the theme of this party. Hi, guys, great to see you. I'd kiss, but it's flu season. This is Hannah. She's our little pudding. Something tells me the, uh, the baby oil is actually going to be used on babies this year. So, first time at a yacht club, huh? I'm guessing you're pretty impressed with me right now. So am I! Well, well, well. Look what the cat cleaned up, showered, exfoliated, powdered, lipsticked, Gucci'd and dragged in. Karen Walker. You know, I thought I saw a waiter out front weeping. Now it all makes sense. Oh, honey, look at you in a yacht club. It's weird. It's--it's kind of like seeing-- you in a yacht club. Well, you might want to get used to it, Karen darling, 'cause you'll be seeing a lot more of me around here, a-hoo-hoo-ha! Are you all right, baby? So, I, uh, I noticed they redid the floors in the bridge room touch me. What did you say? What? Nothing. What did you think I just said fondle me. Mrs. Walker, you're not fooling anyone. What, I'm not trying to fool anyone take me. That's not even subtle. What? What isn't? "Touch me, fondle me, take me." Well, well. Aren't you a dirty bird? But all right! I think I'll go say hello to your husband. You remember him, the one you married in sickness and in wealth? I'll be right back, baby. Mm-mmm! I love to watch him go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. "Ben's so cute! Ben's so sexy! Ben's so big!" I didn't say that. Oh. Well, just get to work! We're not at work. Well, then quit yapping about your boyfriend and file something! Give me a drink. Why are you being-- Ohh! Oh my God! You're jealous! Wh--?! What?! You are! You're jealous of my hot black lover! You know what? You can be really mean sometimes. I'm mean?! You introduce me to your friends as "Bozo Adler." Karen-- She's right, you know. Whoa! Rosario, what are you doing here? Mr. Stan forgot his evening toupee. And shame on you. Oh, for what? Oh, come on, I was just having some fun. You know how rare it is I find something good like that to flaunt in her face. Well, your timing sucks, Bozo. Please don't call me Bozo. Look, I'm gonna tell you something, and if you repeat it, I'm gonna wash your mouth out with toilet cleanser. You're lovely. In a week, Miss Karen will be the same age as Mr. Stan's first wife - when he cut her loose. - So? Do I have to spell it out for you? She's plagued by feelings of insecurity, wondering if she's still attractive to men. I'm hooked on "The View." Karen? I don't believe it. I'm telling you, she's not herself. The other day, I saw her put milk in her cereal. Instead of Bailey's? It's not funny when you know the truth. Well, it's less funny. Oh, poor Karen, I feel awful. I'm gonna go talk to her. Well, since you're sharing. How old is Karen? Come close. Closer. Ow, ow, ow! If you value your life, you'll never ask that again, Bozo! See you later, guys. Bye, Scotty. I know every parent says this, but Hannah really is superior to all the other kids. I mean, you saw the envy in that other baby's eyes. So, wow. What's it like being fathers? I mean, is it amazing? Well, it-it's totally changed our lives. I haven't slept in 8 months, I've completely lost my figure, but I have what I've always dreamed of A family. Yeah, that's neat. Hey, fellas, look. J'adore you, ok? Je can't get enough of you. But, um, it's tough love time. And I know I speak for Will when I say we're very disappointed. This whole baby thing makes you guys losers. What?! It does not-- I don't feel that way. I-- That is completely wrong, and don't ever speak for me. Notice that he did not say I was wrong. Yes, I did, that's exactly what I said. I rest my case. Well, how about resting your pie-hole? I--I think what you guys are doing is very cool. - I can't wait to be a father. - You'd be a great dad, Will. Yeah, you know, I always thought I would. Yeah, I totally want this. I just have to find the right guy and the right uterus. Hopefully not in the same person. I don't get it. I mean, personally I think you should've gotten a bird. They're much more colorful, and you don't get social workers breathing down your neck every time you lock them in a cage at night. Ooh, wrong crowd. You know how you get to that place in your life when the endless parties and the up-all-night and the drinking and the casual sex just don't do it for you anymore? I'm not following. I'm sure this is all boring for you. Tell us what fabulous things you guys have been up to. Oh. Uh, well, we, um We have put together a time capsule. Actually, it's--it's more of a junk drawer, but it's so nice to have everything right there and organized. Oh, and--and we still have our Friday night movie club. - Yeah. - Yeah, we sit in the back row, and every time straight people kiss, we hiss. Oh. Do you know how long it's been since we've been to a movie? Well, here's an idea. I mean, seeing as we're obviously not gonna be doing Jell-O shots and playing pin the tail on the donkey-- - How is the donkey, by the way? - Oh, good. Good. His oldest is starting pre-K. Why don't you two go to a movie, and we'll stay here with Hannah? Woman! Have you lost your mind as well as your looks? I ain't baby-sittin'! - I'll pay you. - I wouldn't do it for $100. - How 'bout 50? - Fine. Guys, if you hurry you can catch the 7:00 show. - What do you think? - Can we do that? I mean, she's just gonna be sleeping anyway. Exactly. Of course you are, aren't you, Hannah? You'd be happy to have me take care of you, wouldn't you? Hmm? What's that? Oh, no, sweetheart. That's not the tooth fairy. No. This fairy doesn't have a job. Ah, Smitty. Why is there so much pain in the world? So much cruelty? Can you tell me that, Smitty? My name is not Smitty. I don't need your life story, nose hair. Just fill her up. Hey, Karen. I just wanted to say sorry about before. - You know, you look great tonight. - Yeah, yeah. No, I mean really great. Listen, I was sitting across the room. And I saw you, and you took my breath away. - What? - Yeah. I mean, you are such a sexy, beautiful, vibrant woman. Anyone would be so lucky to have you. Are you hitting on me? Wh-- What? No! Where do you g-- You are! Oh, my god. You're a big lez. Karen-- You know, people have always said you were, but I said, "No. That's just the way she walks." I have a sturdy gait. Honey, come on. Finally, an explanation for the chunky shoes and all the keys. No. No, no, no, no, no. See-- Look. Look. Um, Karen I just sensed that you were feeling a little down. and I just wanted to make sure that you know how attractive you are. Hey, back off, Lezzy Borden. No means no. Come on, little Hannah. Time for bed. Time for sleep. Say good night. Say good night to Uncle Will and Auntie Jack. Close your eyes. Come on. I don't know-- She's not even tired. Hey, sister go, sister soul, sister go, sister-- Jack. That's not gonna work. - Hey sister go, sister soul, sister soul, sister. - Jack, come on He met Marmalade down in old New Orleans, struttin' her stuff on the street. She said- Hello, hey, Joe you wanna give it a go? Gitchi, gitchi, ya ya ya ya. Gitchi, gitchi, ya ya yee. Mocca chocalata, ya ya. Creole Lady Mamalo. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir? - Voulez-vous coucher avec-- - Jack. Jack. Jack. - She's asleep. - I was just getting to the best part of the song. It doesn't matter because she's asleep. She's cute. Cute? She's heaven. This is really what it's about, you know? And it doesn't seem that hard. I mean, what do they do? They eat. They sleep. They poop. God, I'd kill for that life. You have that life. I want this, you know? I I got to kiss that little puddin's cheeks. - Hey, baby. - Hey. Want to go for a ride on my boat? Oh! Oh, oh, you know, this isn't the time. No. I mean my actual boat. It's docked in the harbor. Oh. Maybe later. Look. - I need you to do something for me. - Anything, baby. I need you to hit on Karen. Please tell me you said: "I need you to put a hit on Karen." Damn it, Jack. You promised you would help me burp her. Will, I don't know nothin' about burpin' no babies. Now get off my back. - I thought we were in this together. - No. This is what you wanted. I never wanted this baby to begin with. I want my life back. Well, guess what? She's here, and we can't send her back. - So how about a little help? - You don't want my help. I told you to do what my mother did to me when I was crying. Jack, I am not gonna leave this child in a laundromat. Well, then leave me at one because I'm a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. God, you're worthless. And don't think I'm gonna forget how you've been tonight. - You are unreliable, irresponsible-- - Oh, shut up, Will! You're just freaked out 'cause you stink at this. - Excuse me? - You suck at being a dad, and you're taking it out on me. I'm gonna go see if she needs changing. - Hey, sweetie. - Hey. - How'd it go? - Well, I gave her some of my best stuff. I gave her the lean in. I gave her the soft touch. I flashed her these. And then I finished off by giving her a little of the 20/20 hindsight. Oh, yeah. Oh, you did a good thing. I appreciate it. Now, where is that boat you keep talking about? Mr. Doucette. May I have a word with you, please? Uh, I'm in the middle of a conversation here. It's a rather pressing matter. I'll be back in a minute, baby. Hi, Ben. Hi, honey. - You seem happy. - Oh, yeah, I am. Listen, Grace. I just-- I want you to know that I know everything you tried to do for me. Are you feeling better? Yeah, I am, but that's not why. Sweet story. Ben's being kicked out of the club. - What?! - Oh, it's so romantic. Oh. Stan saw him hitting on me, and he got so jealous, he threw his ass out. Oh, Stan loves me, Grace. I am walking on air. Yeah. I may give the little admiral a salute tonight. Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. This was not the way it was supposed to go. Oh, it never does, honey. Ooh, speaking of which, you better pack it up, too. They're not crazy about the lesbians. Ooh, hello, hottie in the Honda. Great scar! Oh! Speed up. Come on. Speed, speed up. Uh. Oh, great. He's gone. Was gonna spend the rest of my life with him. What, what? Why do you hate me so much? I don't hate you. I'm not even mad at you. Then why have you been oozing hostility ever since we dropped Sad Doll back off with her parents? I'm upset about what you said earlier. - About your big old boobs? - No. - About you being boney? - No. - About your hair plugs? - I don't have hair plugs. I hate that I couldn't take care of one little kid. You're right. I'd suck as a dad. Uh, I just said that to upset you. I didn't mean it. Whether you meant it or not, it's true. If I can't take care of a kid for one night, how am I gonna do it when it's for real? I always just assumed I'd be a great dad. I never doubted it. No I What are you talking about? You just did the soccer mom arm save. - So? - So you have the instinct. That's not the instinct of a dad. That's the instinct of a guy who didn't take out insurance on his passenger. Will, you're gonna be an awesome dad. You're caring. You're thoughtful. You're generous. You're just saying that to make me feel better. No, I'm not. I mean, what would I get out of that? You're gonna be a great dad because for the last 10 years, you've been a great one to me. - Wanna stop for ice cream? - Nah. Wanna go to a bar and look at hot guys? I love you, daddy.   
                




                    			And then I'll close with something like "And let this be the dawning of a new era, a good feeling between the police department and the gay community." And then applause, applause, applause, and then I guess there'll be a Q & A. Ok, I've got a "Q." Why am I bored off my "A"? I don't know, but why are you being such a "B"? Sweetie, it's too dry. Why don't you do a skit or something? A skit? Grace, this is a gay sensitivity seminar. I'm not gonna do some stupid skit in front of a room full of cops. What is this, "The Electric Company?" - You can call it a "dramatization." - Ooh, I like the dramatization. Yeah, it could be, like, four gay guys that are in a car and a cop pulls them over. Ooh ooh. And then he strip searches them and takes them all downtown. What?! Ok, clean up your area. My, uh, my intern's starting today. Oh, no. No! Grace, you do not want an intern. Believe me. We had this guy at our office-- Brad. Totally useless. Always hanging around, just being annoying. - So he said "no" when you asked him out? - Oh. Did I tell you this story already? Besides, Gillian is nothing like that. We had such a great phone conversation. She's just this cool, smart, enthusiastic design student. She reminds me of a young me. - Why, because she has a wide nose and brown hair? - I did not have a nose job! I'm kidding. Darling, don't you know I'm engaging in a little bit of levity. Don't do British. - You told me you liked it. - You seemed needy that day. I was just trying to make you feel good. Anyway, I'm-- I'm just so excited about having her here. I don't know what it is about her, but she just has this quality I really respond to. - Oh, my God. You're Grace Adler. Hi. I'm Gillian. - Hi. Ok. Let me just get this dorky stuff out of the way, ok? I love you. I love your work. I love you and your work. Ok, now I can be my regular hip self. I love you. I love your work. I love you and your work. No. I can't imagine why you like her. I'm sorry. I don't know you, but you should never do British. Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 4 Girl Trouble W-what I'm trying to do I-I-is dramatize the problems faced by the gay community when they're dealing with the police. A-and I-I worked very hard on this, Jack, - so please, when you pass judgment-- - I can't do this crap! It's garbage! Do you hear me? Garbage! Put it in a cinch sack, throw it on a barge Garbage! Capital G! Arbage! Well, coming from trash, I consider that high praise indeed. Will, there's no character, there's no heart. The part is unplayable, Will! Unplayable! Alright, I'll just have to get somebody else to parade around in front of 50 of New York's finest. Look, I'm not saying I can't make it work. Well, I guess I can put aside my problems with the material. After all, if we can help even one person be more sensitive to gay issues-- Billie Jean King! There are lezzies in this! Martina Navratilova, yes, there are. Oh, I beg of you, Will. Please let them be played by men. No one will ever know the difference. That's what Shakespeare did when he had lesbos in his scripts. Yes. Who could forget the coven of high school gym teachers in MacBeth. Since when did you become so narrow-minded? Hey, there's not a single part of me that is anti-lesbian. Well, maybe one But, trust me. This is something I really want to do. Who's playing the parts? - Our friends from the kite shop, Terry and Annie. - Starsky and Butch?! They hate me! Really? Even after you gave them such affectionate pet names? That's them. Be nice. When am I not nice? Why are you wearing a blouse? Let them in. - Hi. - Hey. We didn't know the appropriate gift for a gay sensitivity seminar training rehearsal. So, we brought a cactus. I believe that is the traditional gift. - Just don't sit on it. - Hah! Even as a game. This is really good. What is this? You know, just some sketches I did for my ex-boyfriend's place. It's really good. Your ex is gonna love it. Ok, but why all the mirrors? I want him to see his chubby cheating ass from all angles. Why don't you take another pass at it before you turn it in? Ok, I will. Hey, uh, do you mind if I just hang around and watch you work? I mean, I'd love to get a sense of what your process is. Oh. Sure. Ok. Oh. Hello, Is Mr. Sanderson there, please? - You sure you don't want to be alone? - No, it's ok, you can listen. Mr. Sanderson, Grace Adler. Hi. Tell me, what's your soup today? Manhattan or New England? Eww. - It was Manhattan. - Eww. I know. Ok, I'm going to grab the fabric board for the Flebotte house. You wanna help me with it? Well, sure. But, I mean, you know I'm just gonna tell you that you're brilliant and shouldn't change a thing. Well, that's the help I'm looking for. Grace, I thought we talked about the beret. Patty Hearst couldn't even pull one off, and she had money and a gun. Oh, my God! What's going on? Now there are four of you! Um, hi. Hi, I'm Gillian. It's nice to meet you. Are you a designer, too? What's going on? What's happening? Why is it talking to me? Karen, this is-- This is Gillian. Remember? Our intern from Cooper Union, first in her class? She's gonna be here for two weeks. Uhh not ringing a bell. Could you give me a hint? I don't need to give you a hint. She's standing right here. Hello? Ok. Rule number one-- Unless you're served in a frosted glass, never come within four feet of my lips. - Should we be scared? - Oh, no. Ha ha. But, uh, let me move you over here, in the unlikely event she unhinges her jaw and swallows you whole. "So, officer, I hope you understand. We just want to be treated the same as anybody. - No better, No worse. - I understand. I learned a valuable lesson today. Everyone deserves to be treated with a little respect. - Even mean lesbian kite sellers." - Oh, that's--! You are this close to losing your post rehearsal yogurt. - That's the line, that's what's written here. - Yeah, that's because you wrote it. In lip liner! At least one of us brought some. - I don't think that's funny. - Why? 'Cause Ellen DeGeneres didn't say it? All right! We're going! Will, we're sorry, but this guy is an idiot. Smart enough to sleep with men! Please, Please, don't go yet. Let me talk to him, please? I beg you. I don't-- I don't know where to start. Neither do I. The wide one is giving me nothing. You are, as of now, the most offensive person in this building. And I'm including Mr. Open Robe with his itchy bits on the tenth floor. - Name one thing I did wrong. - Wha-- One thing? Ok, let's see. You haven't once called them by their names, preferring instead to address them as "mister" or "señor." You've mooed, you've sung the Lumberjack Song. And then you told some joke about the Indigo Girls and a Mexican restaurant that I still don't understand. I could try to appeal to you as a thoughtful gay man, but, ironically, that would be fruitless. Let me take a different tactic. I'm going to challenge you as an actor. Jean Valjean? You're taking my art seriously? I want you to try and play a man who is not offensive to lesbians. It will be my greatest acting challenge to date. But I believe I can do it. Let me try. Here's my back story. Maybe-- Maybe I'm a lesbian-loving international financier with a scar on the left side of my face. Maybe Maybe I drive a Hummer that's always in the shop. Maybe Maybe I dress entirely to the left. Maybe you had a stroke. Maybe I have. I can do this. Ladies, shall we take it from the top? Ok, but just so you know, one more remark and we walk. I understand. Please forgive me for my rudeness earlier. But you see, I recently got a bad Hummer. Ok, now put your sketchbook away 'cause I've got a little surprise for you. Today is the day we learn about upholstered walls. "What's that?" You say. "Upholstered walls? That's madness! It can't be done!" Oh, but it can. Cool. Cool. So, hey, when's Karen getting in? Oh, we've learned not to ask that question. It just sets you up for disappointment, especially when she does come in. What's her deal? Like, where is she from? AhhI think she just appeared fully formed under a moist stone. - I mean, She's a real trip, isn't she? - Well, she's usually on one. She sends me to the coolest places, right? I mean, like yesterday. She sent me to Tiffany's and Barney's. She even sent me to the dog groomer to get the gray out of her poodle. They couldn't because, well, it's a gray poodle. I'm sorry. She shouldn't have you running errands. No, no. It was great. I mean, the moment I mentioned her name at Barney's, people just started kissing my ass. I got a glass of champagne, a personal shopper, and a Percocet. It was awesome! You should see what happens when you mention my name at The Rug Barn. You get a glass of cold mint tea and a rough kiss from a guy named Misha. Hi, honey. Sorry I'm late. I've been runnin' all over town, but I promise you it was work-related. You were shopping. How is that work-related? Honey, I was avoiding work. I mean, really, sometimes I just-- You're not Hey, Karen, so what'd you get? Oh, I got this coat. Oh, I'm over it. Hey, Gillian, I wasn't going to show just yet, but my idea for a bathroom-- Moroccan meets rubber. "What?! Ok, now you've gone too far, missy!" - Honey, you want this? - What? Oh, my God, could I? Wow. That is so soft. I know. It's made out of kittens. Ha ha! That's so fabulous. Thank you so much. Honey, could you get that? I'm so sorry my intern didn't show up yet. I'm sure she'll be there any second. Anyway, I'm so glad that you loved the cork floors. I knew you would. They're so versatile. They're so durable. Just a few things: Don't walk on them, No heavy furniture, Don't let sun get on them, and as far as having kids, I'd hold off for at least 5 years. Enjoy. Honey, that was the best lunch I've had in years. - Oh, honey, me, too. - Honey, you didn't eat a thing. Honey, I was talking about the olives. Gillian, nice of you to put in an appearance. I was just filling out your evaluation. What do you think I should put down for punctuality? I was going to put down a check, but now I think I'm going to have to change that to a check-minus. Ok, I have a good excuse. Karen and I drank a long lunch at the Four Seasons. Gillian, just get-- just get to work. Oh, honey, no. I have an appointment at Yolanda's for a spirulina masque. Oh, and by the way, that color doesn't even look good an orange, ok? Kisses all around! I like her spunk. Very professional. Karen, I'm really not interested in talking to you right now. I've a lot of work to do. - Ok. - So could you stop talking? What! Wait Where's my Croissandwich? Karen? Karen! - Honey, you told me not to-- - Where is my ham and cheese Croissandwich?! That thing in the bag? Honey, I thought that was trash. I threw it away. - You threw it away?! - It was starting to crawl for the door. Oh! Great! Great! Why don't you just throw everything in my life away?! "Hi. I'm Karen Walker. I'm throwing everything away. I don't know what it is. It doesn't fit into my life. I'm throwing it away." - Honey, you want another Crois-- - They only serve them till 11:00! This whole day is ruined. This whole week is ruined. Now my business is probably going to go under, and it's all your fault. - What? - And you have a pore on your nose you could serve dip out of. I just wanna tell you. I think you're doing great with Terry and Annie. I do what I do, for I am what I am. What's with the voice? I was trying to find my character and I came up with this voice. Well, Angela Lansbury wants it back. You're playing a cop. Talk normal. You might as well just ask me to throw out my whole character. Yeah. Good. Throw it out. Alright, let's get started. Everybody take your seats. Ok, welcome to the Caribbean sensivity seminar. - Uh, actually, officer, we're, uh - Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. Today we're doin' the gays. Let's, uh, give 'em a warm welcome. Thank you-- Ahem-- Very much. We'd like to start with a dramatization based on an actual complaint lodged against the police department. I think this will illustrate the kind of insensitivity that our community's concerned about. Before we begin, I would ask that you refrain from the taking of flash photography as the lesbians may attack you. - Oh, that's it! - We're outta here! Oh, Annie! Terry! - Jack! - What? - How could you?! - You're the one who told me to abandon my character-- The lesbian-loving gay financier with a Hummer in the shop. I just asked you to abandon that queer voice. "Queer"? Who you callin' queer, you blouse-wearin' fairy? This from the homo who minces around the gym in a lycra onesie. - Grace wears one. - She's a woman, you girl! - Don't call me a girl! Eyebrow-plucker! - Leg-waxer! - Lady! - Tramp! - Hi, honey! - Hi, honey. Honey, sit down. What's going on? What's happening? What's this all about? I've got something tough to tell you. Uh, I'm fabulous, ok? I'm an incredible dresser, I've got buckets of money, I'm a hoot and a half, and I got a killer rack. Do you get what I'm saying? Uh, not really. Honey, you're not me, and you never will be. Is it the rack? No But it's a big part of it. Now, you're never going to be me, but you've got a good chance to be Grace, and that's nothing to sneeze at, honey. You shouldn't have thrown it away so quickly. But, Grace, she's just notus. Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup Watch your mouth, or I'll wash it out with cheap vodka. That's my little girl you're talkin' about. Now, Grace is a damn good role model-- She's bright, she's successful, she's the worst dresser in the whole, wide world. She's talented, and I look up to her. Honey, why else would I be here? You told me it's 'cause hate being home with Stan and the kids. That's a big part of it. But there's tons of places I could be away from them, and I choose to be away from them here. Now, you came here to learn. Let Grace teach you. Well, I do wanna be a designer someday. And so does she. It's a perfect match. Listen, get your ass over to Bergdorf's and buy her an I'm-Sorry gift, something she'd like, but nothing red. Or orange. Or yellow or green or stripes or plaids or zippers or epaulets. Or fur or feathers or sequins or pleats. You get the idea. Yeah, I get the idea. Hey, can I still use the word "honey"? Wh--? Aww No. Hi, Karen. I just wanted wanted you to know that I heard what you said, and I just wanted to say thank you. Oh. Oh, honey. Or polka-dots! Sorry I called you a tight-ass cyber-sissy. Oh, that's ok. Sorry I called you a shallow, youth-obsessed, prancing cabaret queen. - You didn't call me that. - Well, I meant to. We really blew it. You know, we had the perfect opportunity to educate people, maybe open up some minds, and instead we behaved like a couple of gay buffoons. We wimped out on our entire community. And the cold cuts are gone. Nice. Well, that was, uh, quite a production. Yeah. Sorry about that. What are you talking about? I mean, it was riveting. I mean, the way you depicted how words can wound people. You know, I'm ashamed to say it, but I recognized a lot of my colleagues and myself in what you portrayed. That's exactly what I imagined when I wrote it. That's exactly what I imagined when I acted it. It took people of great courage and maturity to do what you did. Thank you very much, Officer? Cox. Officer Cox. Hey, that was a great presentation. I really got something out of it. Oh, thanks. Thank you for your help. Hey, let me ask you something. I know this guy. I think he might be a gay but I don't know for sure. "A gay?" What makes you think he might be a gay, officer? Well, he wears shorts. He's always working out. He's got really defined biceps. Tight abs. Rock-hard thighs. - How's the ass? - Good. Nice and high. Yeah I'd say someone's gay.   
                




                    			Will, what do you think? Too gay? Yeah, definitely. But the shirt's good. Ha ha ha. Hold on, I got a cramp from not laughing. It's for my show. What show? Oh. Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the theater, the tragic return of Just Jack! Just Jack is dead to me. I'm sick of people coming up to me on the street going, "nyeek nyeek". That's just your mom. And Rory. Anyway. I'm going a whole new way. My new show is called Jack 2000. God, you're a chameleon. You're like Madonna. without the corsets and the talent. Just give me some fliers. I'll pass them out at work. What's this? Unsolicited generosity? Jack confused. Well, I'm in a good mood, 'cause, um, something happened. And I am telling you this, Jack McFarland, in confidence. Oh, my God. This must be really good. Miss Hathaway, hold my calls. You know the souvlaki vendor at the corner of Yeah. He is kind of No, you didn't? I did. - But he doesn't speak a word of English. - I know. That is so hot. Tell me what happened, quickly. Where did you go? Well, first we returned his cart. Then we went for a long walk and ended up making out in the doorway of the Republican Party headquarters. You're my new hero. If you didn't smell like shaved lamb, I'd hug ya. Hey. Ho ho ho. Man, do you look queer. I wouldn't joke, Grace. It's your shirt. - So how was your date with Ben? - Amazing. We had this fantastic dinner at B.J., then we took one of those hansom cab rides around central park. It was so romantic, it didn't even bother me that the horse's tail kept hitting me in the mouth. Then he walked me home. It started to rain. It was like a movie. It was a perfect evening. - And now you're breaking up with him. - Now I'm breaking up with him. What happened? You know, yesterday you were adding milk to your mochacino to show me what pretty colors your kids would be. I'm not in love with him. Sure, he's perfect on paper. He's mature. He's romantic. All the smells work. He's not prettier than me. But the relationship just isn't going anywhere. Grace, I really--I think you should give this another week. Well, why? I mean, what happens if during that week, I miss out on the chance of finding the person I'm going to spend the rest of my life with? Even so, one more week? Ha haahem. - What're you getting out of this? - Nothing. Why would I ge-- Um, uh, Ben promised me a Herman Miller chair for my office. You're selling my ass so that yours can be comfortable? And my back. It's--it's really quite a chair, Grace. - No. - It's a Herman Miller. - No. - It's very expensive. - No. - It's got 198 positions. So did Ben and I, but I'm still breaking up with him. Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 5 Grace 0, Jack 2000 I object! You're out of order! No, you're out of order. This whole court is out of order. I assume in this case, you represent the Lollipop Guild? It arrived a day early. So you can break up with Ben now. You have my full lumbar support. Don't worry. I'm going to do it today. I even practiced on the cabdriver on the way over. There was some tears, but Furuz Mahkbhubi and I agreed to stay friends. Uh-huh. Look what the arms do. Huh? There she is. My gorgeous girl. Come on, Ben, not in front of Grace. Hey, baby. Obviously you two have things to talk about. It's ok. I've got some serious work to do. Meep, meep. Meep, meep. We got to get him a guy. Ben, I need to talk to you about something. Look I've given this a lot of thought, and, well, we both know that this has sort of played itself out, and I care about you so much, but I really think it would be best if we stop seeing each other. No. Excuse me? No. I don't accept that. Well, I don't know if it's a matter of you accepting it or not. - I mean, I do want to explain my feelings-- - No need. We're fine. No we're not. I'm here to break up with you, and my mind is made up. - No, it isn't. - Yes, it is. - No, it isn't. - Yes, it is. - No, it isn't. - Yes, it is! Ben, I--I really, really want to break up with you. - That's not what you want. - Oh, but it is. - No, it's not. - Stop saying that! Just saying the opposite of what I'm saying is not a legitimate argument. Yes, it is. I'll pick you up at 8:00. - No, you won't. - Yes, I will. God, this went so much better with Furuz Mahkbhubi. I feel the earth, ouch, move, wow, under my feet, I feel the sky tumblin' down, tumblin' down, tumblin'-- hi! Welcome to Jack, 2000. And now in the tradition of Natalie and Nat King Cole, I'd like to sing a duet with a beautiful young man who's been such a huge inspiration to me. - Yeah! - Ing! - Yeah! - Bird! - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! Mockingbird now - Everybody, have you heard? - Have you heard? - He's going to buy me a mockingbird - Mockingbird - And if that mockingbird don't sing - It doesn't sing - He's going to buy me a diamond ring - Diamond ring There isn't a drink maximum, is there? - Now everybody have you heard? - Have you heard? Littl-l-l-le lamb. Thank you. Now comes the part of the show I like to call, "And how are you doing?" So how are you all doing? Ooh, quiet crowd. No, we're just bored. Been there. Done that. Got the T-shirt. - So where are you from, sir? - Um, New Hampshire. Ahh, the Windy City. - And what do you do there? - Well, I live here now. So. So. What? You live here in the club? You stink! Ha ha. Takes one to know one. Takes one. Takes one. Takes one. Jack, do another song or something. - Shh, this is going to work. - No, it isn't. Yes, it is. - You're dying out here. - Would you just stick to what you do best, trolling the park for greasy souvlaki vendors? He did, you know. Yeah, the guy didn't speak a word of English, but fortunately, Will's fluent in skank. Yeah, skank. Jack? Stop. But hey, let's talk about Will's last significant relationship, huh? Which took place about-- oh, it's 10:00-- 3 years ago! Yeah, you want to know how little Willie tried to win him back? - Yeah, I want to know! - Jack, don't. Don't do this. By standing outside his bedroom window singing a medley of Peter, Paul, and Mary songs. Too bad Michael rowed his boat ashore to another guy. He's pretty funny, isn't he? The reviews are in and the critics agree, the show's a smash. Listen to this e-mail Rory just gave me. "The show's a smash. I'm really into Asians now." But, uh, listen, it's really taking off for me, Will. Listen, do me a favor. If you see me acting like a big star, just keep me real. I don't believe you. I told you that story in confidence. - Well how was I supposed to know that? - Because I used the words: "I'm telling you this in confidence." Well, let's not split hairs. Especially yours, since you're thinning on top. Ooh, that's good. Open with the "thinning on top" bit. Jack! You are not allowed to take my personal life and put it on stage just for a few laughs. A few laughs? Were you there? When I did the look on your face when Michael told you he was moving out I got a rolling laugh that went on for like-- A minute and a half. Jack! You hurt my feelings. Get over yourself. I am an artist. It is my responsibility to draw from my life and the lives of others to get laughs and to sell cocktails. Just like Picasso. Right, but the key difference between you and Picasso is that he is one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, and you are a raging pinhead. I am never telling you anything again. Fine! I don't need you. You-- Enemy of art! Hey You guys have fun tonight? Oh, you missed a great show. Yeah, Jack decided to entertain the crowd with a few embarrassing tidbits from my personal life. Oh, sweetie, that's horrible. He didn't tell them about that time you stood up at model U.N. with the pee-pee track in your khakis, did he? It was Sprite. Maybe going in. Just let it die! I--I'm never telling Jack anything again. Good! You shouldn't. That's the only way he'll learn. You stick to your guns. - How'd your breakup with Ben go? - I slept with him. What?! I know, I know, I know. I went over there to make sure he really knew that we were broken up. One thing led to another, and we ended having breakup sex. Twice. Ok! 3 times. Let's see. Once, twice, three times I don't think that makes you a lady. You just doubled your pleasure! Now you double my fun! Sing out, Louise! Jack, this is the most amazing story, and you are never going to believe it Mainly because you're never going to hear it. What? Remember, Jack, we don't do that anymore, 'cause you can't be trusted. Pffft! Now. It's a documented scientific fact that one twin is always gay. Which one is it? The cute one or the cute one? I ca-- Oh, no. Look. Luis forgot his javelin. They came with props?! Speak! I'm sorry, Jack, that's the price you pay for being an artist. Or as the twins say-- oh, I can't tell you. You, are no friend of mine! I feel the earth, yawn, move, pfft, under my feet. I feel the sky tumblin' down, tumblin' down, tumblin'-- back in an hour. I hope you don't mind that I'm going to Jack's show tonight. I just figure if I break up with Ben in a public place, there's a better chance I won't end up sleeping with him. Grace, you gotta be tough about this. - You got to tell him what you really want. - Oh, I will. See, that's good. Now you sure you want to do this? - Why? You think I'm making a mistake? - See. That's bad. Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Honey, I don't yell. Where the hell am I? Is this student housing, and are bowling shoes back? Ok. I'm changing. Hey. Hey, Wilma. Come on. You got to come with me down to Jack's club. He's bombing. Come on. Beep, beep, beep, let's go. Of course he's bombing, because he doesn't have me to make fun of. Forget get it. I'm not going to put myself into a position to be laughed at again. It's the same reason I don't throw a ball in front of people. Lord, you're sick. He's bombing because he's miserable. And he's miserable because you're still mad at him. Yeah, he's sullen. He's morose. He's humorless. He's-- oh, my god. He's you. Ahem. You know, if Hell ever needs an ambassador-- God! Why do I always have to be the adult? Because you are the adult, Will. Come on. Let him off the hook. Show a little kindness. Honey, not those. Oh, God. I can't stand it any longer. You're chewing like a big cow. Hand it over! I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous. I'm breaking up with Ben, tonight. What's the problem, Grace? He's not gay? No, he's--great. He's just not right. Of course he's not white. Sheesh - Right. He's not right. - Listen, Ben is a catch. And for some reason, he's crazy about you. What is your problem? Amazing how one little cardboard tree can make so little difference. Look, Karen, the bottom line is I'm just not in love with him. Yeah, well, all I know is ever since you two got together, I've never seen you happier. How do you know that's not love? You flash in the pan. You one-hit wonder. You Vanilla Ice. You know what? You're right. He is better than any guy I've ever gone out with. Am I sabotaging what could be the best thing that's ever happened to me? That is my M.O. I mean, this is a man who refused to break up with me. That's love. He loves me. If I weren't so picky, maybe I would love him, too. Maybe I do. Maybe this is what love feels like. I should just say it. I love him. I said it. That wasn't so hard. I love him. - I love him! - Hey, baby. Hey, you! - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing here? Supporting the arts. I mean, after all, I spent years supporting the artist. So what are you saying? I'm saying Use it all. The souvlaki guy, Michael leaving, the Sprite on my khakis in front of the Security Council. Ooh, the pee-pee story? Hey, hey. What about those twins? Oh, well, you know. We met in the park. Tossed the javelin. I got a groin pull. They carried me home. It was humiliating. But ask me out there. The crowd'll eat it up. - My gosh, Will. Thank you so much. - You're welcome, artist Formerly known as princess. Hey, I just want to say something. I am so glad we are back together. Oh, yeah. About that. I've been giving it some thought. I think it would be best for me if we stopped seeing each other. - Wait. What are you talking about? - Aw, come on, Grace. I mean, we're not in love, so I'm ending this. No, but you-- Oh! All right. I get it. I see what's going on here. Ok. Ok. Well, guess what? I don't accept it. Well, that's immaterial, because I am breaking up with you. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. No, you're not! Look! I've been pushed around enough about this. I know what I want, and I want you, and we're staying together. There's nothing you could say to change my mind. - Grace? - Oh, you're right. - Just for the record, I broke up with you. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. Hey, everybody! Welcome back. Now comes the part of the show that I like to call, "And how are you all doing?" Let's look out into the audience, shall we? Ooh! I see somebody I know. Mr. Will Truman. Want to hear a little something about Will? Yeah. He's-- There's a, um-- He's a friend of mine. Hey, where you from? - Montana. - Only two things I know come from Montana-- Steers and queers. Everybody, welcome. What is wrong with me? It's like I can be talking to anything. Ooh. Don't say that when you're giving me a back rub. Yeah, you do look tight. Any requests? Just play something that'll make me feel better. Ben, the two of us need look no more Nice. We both found what we were looking for With a friend to call my own. You'll never be alone-- You know what? I forget the rest of it.   
                




                    			Yeah, you're a wicked little schoolboy to be talking to me like this in the middle of a work day. I'll make you stay after school and bang the erasers. Ok, ok, yeah. Yeah, you like it rough. Don't you, you dirty little monkey? Yeah. Next time I see you, I'm gonna bend you over my knee-- Oh, crap, I gotta go. Mom and mom are home. Now we know how she's making that extra $2.95 per minute. You know, you talk a lot of trash about that husband of yours, but when you get right down to it, you two still have the hots for each other. Yeah Yeah, we do. But that wasn't Stan. That was your boyfriend, Nicholas something. Nicholas? Nicholas is an ex-boyfriend. Honey, with you, I thought the "ex" was implied. He flew into town this weekend. He can't wait to see you. Which I guess would make you his layover. "Grace Adler is now ready for boarding. Buckle up. There's bound to be some turbulence." What are you, 10? - So who is this sexy exie, anyway? - He's a cellist with the Boston Symphony. We went out for a little while a couple of years ago. It was, uh, interesting. Grace is just being modest. It was terrible. - For six weeks, all you guys did was fight like cats. - Yeah, but we made up like dogs. Oh, I can't wait to see him. Grace Adler Designs. Hey there, big daddy. - What are you up to, you little dirty dirty? - Ok, hang up, hang up. Hey, sexy. Oh, hi, Dad. Will & Grace Saison 3 - Episode 6 Love Plus One synchro: kingo Ok, I say yes on the pants, yes on the sweater, and definitely yes with the other decision you're struggling with, ok? Hey. Hey. Psst, Jack. - Oh, hey, Karen-- - Ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka! I'm Anastasia Beaverhausen! Why are you using your alias? Because I passed a couple of bad checks here. You know, for sport? Mrs. Beaverhausen, can you believe it? Me, a Banana Republic sales associate. And my guidance counselor said I'd never amount to anything. Honey, I'm so proud of you. Come on. Let's go to Barney's. There's a new salesgirl there, and we gotta get her fired. She has a gray tooth. Come on. I can't. I can't. I'm working. Hello? Well, yeah, and I'm ovulating, but nothing's gonna come of that, either. You don't understand. I have responsibilities. Look, a headset. You know This isn't working. This is gonna interfere with our friendship. I work a 40-hour month for what's-her-name, - and I always make time for us. Come on. - Karen-- I can't, all right? But I promise. Nothing's gonna change between us. Hey, I'll come over later, and we'll short-sheet Rosario's bed. Ok. Maybe we can take a big bubble bath together. Nothing would give me more pleasure than to sponge-clean the Beaverhausen. - Wilma. - Anastasia. Uh, hey. I just received a message saying you have a new job and you're going to buy me dinner. There's, like, 18 things wrong with that sentence. Will, The Banana has changed my life. It's all about The Banana. Hasn't it always been? Hey, save that smut for Loehman's. You're in The Republic now. Hey, Grace. Nicholas. Hi. - It's been a long time. - Yeah, it has. Even longer, since you were supposed to be here 20 minutes ago. What are you talking about? You said "1:20." - I said 1:00. Who says "meet at 1:20?" - Here we go. I've been waiting here a half hour. I was so bored, I almost started to read. Listen Don't blame me because you're unclear--as usual. I was totally clear. You just hear whatever you want to hear. - You look hot. - So do you. - So, how's Boston? - Do you really care? No. Just making conversation till we get to the good stuff. - How about that? I'm fresh out of conversation. - How about that? There you are. - Oh, hey, love. - Hey, baby. You must be Grace. So nice to meet you. Thank you You I'm not late, am I? You told me to be here at 1:35. Oh, my God. I've been looking for this book. It's the perfect size to replace that little foot that broke off my hamper. - I'll be right back. - Ok. So, uh Your sister seems nice? No, she-- She's not my sister. She's my girlfriend. She joined the Symphony last year. She plays the flute. Nicholas, I'm so embarrassed. I mean, if I had known that kiss before was just a "hello" kiss, I would have used a lot less tongue. See, when you called, I thought you wanted to get together to do what we get together to do. That's right. - But you have a girlfriend now. - That's right. Ok, I guess I'm a little dense, 'cause, I mean, you can't have sex with me and your girlfriend at the same time. That's wrong. What? But Oh. Oh, but-- Oh! - Oh, my God. There he is. He's back. - Who? The man I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with. Look at him, Will. He's perfection. So loverly. - He makes me want to be a bigger man. - You mean "a better man." Yeah, that, too. - How do you know he's gay? - He beeped. - He's a cutie. Why don't you go talk to him? - I can't. You "can't?" What woulYou're not shy around men. You'd hit on the Pope if he drove a better car. Come on. You're get it, you're Jack. Get in there. - I'm Jack. - You're Jack. - I'm Jack. - Jack. - I'm Jack. - You're Jack. I'm Jack. I'm Jack. I'm Jack. I'm Jack. I'm Jack. I'm Jack. I'm Jack-- Does this shirt come in anything besides cranberry? Because I just don't think it will go with my gooseberry pants. So, what fruit will go with this pants? Uh, gandaberry, lingonberry, Halle Berry? Ok, thanks. Me! I'm the fruit that would go with those pants. Nice try. Tell me. Does this come in a boot? Can you imagine me in a 3-way? Honey, I can barely imagine you in 2-way. Hey, come on. I mean, it's not outside the realm of possibility. Grace, I can see me in a 3-way. I can see Karen in a 3-way. Oh, honey, every night with Stan is a 3-way-- Me, him, and Johnnie Walker Black. Just the three of us. But you're just not that girl. No way, no how. Hey, I have been known to get a little crazy in the boudoir. Some might even call mekinky. Hey! Sweetheart. People who are truly kinky never use the word kinky. And who the hell says "boudoir"?! "Hey, hey. Look at me. I'm kinky, and I'm in the boudoir." Ok. Ok, ok. So maybe I haven't had sex with more than one person at a time, but I've done a lot of crazy things. I once had sex in the kitchen. Ooh. What are you-- A rock star? All right. No. You're done. I have clients coming. Get out. If I don't, are you gonna spank me, kinko? - Get out! - Whoa! If I hear anything like that in the boudoir, watch out! I don't care what either of you say, I am not a prude. Oh, honey. Come on. Come on. I love you like the mother I had committed against her will. But you are Prudence McPrude, the Mayoress of Prudie Town. Karen, you are wrong. Quack, quack. No, I'm not. - Yes, you are! - Quack. Look, you know what? Not only am I the kind of person who would do a 3-way, I'm the kind of person who's going to do a 3-way. So say good-bye to Prudence McPrude, and say hello to Slutly Slutenstein. Excuse me. I'm looking for Jack. Jack, you have a visitor, and he's cute. If I didn't have a girlfriend, I'd be so into him. He'll be right here. Hey, hey. What's with this page? "Baby bear needs mama bear." You- You're only supposed to use that in a gay emergency. It is an emergency. He's back. His pants Are ready. Have lovelier words ever been uttered? Say it soft, and it's almost like praying. I need your help, Will. I figured out what it is about him that scares me. He's a smarty. I heard him on his cell phone using big words like "particular" and "delicatessen." I need you to make me smart. All right. I'll--I'll need a mad scientist, two electric switching helmets, and a willing monkey. There's not enough time. Oh, my God. There he is. - Please, Will, help me. - I still don't understand what you want me to do. It's not like I can talk for you. Oh, my God. You're a girl genius. That's exactly what you can do. Scott, call home. Your girlfriend's pregnant. - What? How? - Just go. No, no, no. No, Jack. This is ridiculous. No. I've never felt this way about anyone. Please. All right. What could possibly go wrong with this plan? Testing, testing. Sibilant. Rhubarb. My dog has fleas. Yeah, I hear you, Jack. Approaching target. Approaching target. Oh, my. Look how flat target's stomach is. Ok, I'm in. Give me a line a smarty would open with. Hello? Hello. - Hi. - Oh, my God. It's working. I just bought She's Come Undone, but I was disappointed when I got home and I realized it wasn't a biography of J. Edgar Hoover. So what are you reading these days? Oh, good question. What am I reading? What am I reading? What am I reading? Actually, I'm re-reading an old favorite, Rabbit Run. Actually, I'm re-reading an old favorite, Rabid Nun. - Rabbit Run, you idiot. - Rabbit Run, you idiot. Rabbit Run. No! - You're the idiot! - No, you're the idiot! I mean-- I mean, I'm the idiot. I'm c-c-crazy. - Why did you let me do that? - Hey! A ventriloquist is only as good as his dummy. - So listen, Matthew-- - So listen, Matthew-- --if you like She's Come Undone, you know what else you might like? --if you like She's Come Undone, you know what else you might like? If I tore off my clothes and gave you a lap dance on the V-neck sweaters. If I tore-- If I-- If I tore over here and invited you to caress the insole of our brand-new seamed Oxford. Ooh, seems a little fast. I like to get to know a shoe before I put my foot in it. Take it to dinner, buy it a sock. So, what is it you do? So, what is it you do? - I work in television. - Oh, my God. I love TV. Buffy is my life. I'm so into Willow being a lez. Did you have anything to do with that? No, I'm a sports writer. I write news, sports, you know, like that. Sports? I got nothing. The last sporting event I watched was "Circus of the Stars." - Hey, do you have this in a size 8? - I don't work here. - So, back to Buffy. Is it really-- - Forget Buffy, you boob. - Ask him what he does for fun. - What do you do for fun? Oh, I don't know. Let's see, uh Oh. Well, tonight, I'm going to an opening at the Spielman Gallery, where I'll probably get shamed into buying some art. - Oh, my god. I got-- - Oh, my God. I got shamed at that gallery, too. That little skinny woman with the big hands and the blue veins who wouldn't take no for an answer. I know her. She did a number on me. She made me buy this 4x6 canvas of a foot. Fortunately, I got out of there before she made me buy this hideous sculpture they had out front. - Japanese Man With Fish? - Japanese Man With Fish? - Japanese Man With Fish. - I bought it. - I bought it. - You didn't. - I did. - Hey, can we talk about something I'm interested in?! Jack, Jack. Don't bail. This is working. - Look, Matthew. Let me ask you something. - Matthew, let me ask you something. And don't take this the wrong way. Get out of here, you silly woman! Get out of here, you silly woman! You, you silly woman. Out! Now, where were we? I think I should get going. All right, look. Obviously, you have some stuff you need to work out up here, ok? Um, and I don't know if I'm invested enough to start couples counseling. Maybe it's just as well, Jack, because I think I'm interested in somebody else. Yeah. Whatever you need to tell yourself, ok. Just promise me you'll allow yourself some time to grieve. Maybe I can start the grieving process while you get my pants. Good idea. Will, you're fired. Hey, listen, lady. I told-- Oh, sorry. Call me. It was nice talking to you. Me? Well, the-- Well, you and Jerry Lewis need to work on your act. I don't know what happened. W-we killed at The Gap. The-the first one's my home number. - I'm Will, by the way. - I'm Matt. Matt, I know. Nice meeting you. You, too. You think Jack's gonna be ok? I just need to measure your inseam. - But I just want socks. - Yeah. Yeah, I think the healing process has already begun. Ok, I'm here. What's first? Who's first? How do we do this? First, we slow down. Come on in. Let me take your coat. You're not nervous, are you? Nervous? No. What gave you that idea? Two coats. Look at that. Well, the first coat's really just a primer. It won't get in the way of anything we're doing here. - So where's Paula? - I'm here. Hi, Grace. Hey, hey, Paula. Let me take your coat. Oh, thank you. Oh. Ok, go. Come on. Relax, Grace. It's gonna be fun. We're just gonna-- - Nicholas? - What? Why did you put my flute on the window? You know it can't get wet. - I'm sorry. - Geez. I'm sorry. Look, it's no big deal-- Hey! You want me to sit between the two of you. Ok. Isn't it funny how this is the universal symbol for take a seat? I mean, it's the same to everybody-- Kids, dogs, sluts. Come on, Grace. Don't say that. Do you remember when I - Remember? - Yeah. It could be just like that. Ok? Well, it's just-- this time I'd have to wait my turn, but-- Ok. There you go. Ok Yeah, that feels better. Hmm Ok, I'm gonna have to work my way up to you, but nice robe. Oh. Oh, that feels nice. Strong hands. Oh! More strong hands. They're popping up everywhere. Just like Starbucks franchises, only sexy. She has beautiful hair, doesn't she, Paula? What? You're still on the flute? - Well, you put it there on purpose, didn't you? - Give me a break, please? Oh, gosh. Oh, that's nice. I really had a knot there. Because if I put your cello there under the window, the wrath that would rain down on me-- The only purpose of a flute is to make people cry during Irish movies. You know what? I am done. Next time you want to do a 3-way, why don't you do it with your cello and your ego? Well, at least my cello makes noise when I touch it. - Guys? - I hate you, Nicholas! I am so tired of you, Paula. Hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute. Do you know how much soul-searching I had to do to come up with the courage to-- Oh, damn it. I am burning up! Look This is not me, ok? I'm a good girl from Schenectady. I went to Sunday school for 10 years. I was 16 before I let Bobby Kay go to second. So for me to come and participate in this is a big deal. So you two kiss and make up, because the three of us are gonna GET IT ON! - Baby, you are so hot! - Let's do this right now. Wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no. What is it? W-w-what, what? This isn't me, ok? I'm a good girl from Schenectady. I went to Sunday school for 10 years. I was 16 before I let Bobby Kay go to second, so for me to come here and participate, this is a big deal. Too big a deal. So I'm sorry, but I'm-- I'm-- I'm gonna have to back out of this. And I just want to make this as smooth an exit as possible, so I'm just gonna take my sweater and my sweatshirt and my jacket and my other jacket. Gosh, I feel like I'm leaving you high and dry. Do you want me to get the concierge? She--she looked pretty cute. Ok. I guess I always thought of myself as a little kinky. Come on, Grace. It's ok. I've never been in a 3-way. Yeah, but you're gay. You have the kinky built in. Oh, sure. That's why I joined. So, come on. How was your sexcapade, honey? Were you the ham in a philharmonic sandwich? Did you roll over for Beethoven? - You want me to tell her? - No, that's ok. I'm not ashamed. It was fantastic. There were so many arms and legs everywhere, Hindus were praying to us. Oh You sleazy skank. What? Karen-- I gotta take the rest of the day off. The air in this room is ripe with filth. For God's sake, Grace. I'm a mother. Oh!

And she gave me a similar hand gesture, but with a different finger. - Maybe we should do this another night. - Nooooo. Sweetie, we talked about that sound. But we're all leaving tomorrow. I want us to have dinner together before Thanksgiving. You mean tonight isn't thanksgiving? Oh, crap. Now I have to spend all day tomorrow, watching Stan gorge himself on thighs and breasts and turkey. Well, if we have to wait, um, why don't I get a bottle of champagne? That's a nice idea. What would you guys like? Can I have another one of those, only bigger? Oh, tears, booze I love the holidays, too. Do you think that men can't be trusted? Honey, I've always said, if your genitals are on the outside, you're hiding something on the inside. I should warn you. Further conversation with her will only lead to more tears. - Are you ok? - I'm fine. Grace, leave her alone. She obviously doesn't want to talk. It's my boyfriend, Tom. I mean, I don't know what happened. You know, just when things started to get kinda serious, he starts to pull away. Which is so weird because we have so much in common, like, we're both dance majors We both know all the songs from "The Wiz"-- And we both collect Victorian dolls. What's your name, dear? - Pam. - Pam. Hi, I'm Jack McFarland, of course. Come, join our little circle of love and dysfunction. This is Karen Walker. This is Will Truman right here. And this is your sorry ass future, if you don't dump that boyfriend of yours. Jack! I-- Will, defend me. Come on, man. Yeah, guys, our little Pammy's in pickle. And, uh, shouldn't we help her find her way back to a place called hope? Honey, she's wearing synthetic plaid. It's a 4-day drive and a boat trip to a place called hope. What are you talking about? Well, I think you need to hear a little story about when these two were dating. Or as I like to call it, "When Mary Met Sally." - Jack - No. No. You are not telling that story. It was an incredibly difficult time in my life, and this is not the time or the place. The year was 1985. My freshman year in college So, uh, this is the big weekend, huh? - You going to her house for Thanksgiving? - Oh, yeah. It is a scientific fact that college girls love getting it on in their folks' house. You have nailed her, haven't you? Oh, please! Huh. I've not only nailed her, I--I've sanded, buffed, stained and spackled her. Ok, what do you mean you and Will have never done it? Well, he wants to take it slow, and I see his point. I mean, we're soul mates, so there's no rush. Yeah, I taught her a few things. Let me tell you my friend, she's an excellent student. Like he taught me how to scrunch my hair to keep the curl. You know me, nothing I love more than sex. Wi-wi-with a woman. And he's so handsome. He reminds me of those old Hollywood movie stars, like Rock Hudson or Montgomery Clift. Ok, fine. Do what you want. Just afraid you're gonna miss your window. Oh, please. Don't be insane. What window? Ok, you know my psych professor, Dr. Bonami, he says if you don't do it with a guy right away, you just end up as friends. - Did he really say that? - Yeah. Do you-- Do you really think if you're-- Friends I would die if that happened. I mean, - who wants a guy as a friend? - Uh, thank you. If I want to take this relationship to the next level, we have to make love soon. Like this weekend. Don't say, "make love". It sounds, like, totally gay. Yo, beer's gone. Bye, sweetie. I'm gonna pack. Bye. That's ok, I'll clean up. Hi. - What are you doing in the closet? - I could ask the same of you. What?! Who are you? Oh, how quickly they forget. We met at Matt Stokes' party. My card. "Jack McFarland. Since 1969." What are you even doing here? Aren't you in high school? Well, I prefer the college parties 'cause the fellas tend to be less uptight about their homosesuality. Oh, yeah, now I remember you. You were the one going around telling everybody you were in Duran Duran. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah. Oh, a-and you think everybody's gay. No, not everybody, just me And you and a dog named Boo. Hey, hey. Heh. I'm not gay. Well, this well-worn copy of the "Dreamgirls" soundtrack begs to differ. Anyway, what does this have to do with Tom and me? Let me shorthand it for you, honey. The Sultan of Boran? - What does that have to do w-- - Your story was boring. Anyway, after my little talk with Ellen, I decided that it had to be that weekend. So, we took a train up to my parent's house in Schenectady, where Will learned the answer to that age-old question, "What ever did happen to Baby Jane?" Gloria, Gloria. I think they got your number, Gloria. I think I got your alias, Gloria and you been living under, ahaaaaa-- Mom! - Hi, mom. Hi, Julius. - Honey, you're home. Grace, I always forget how beautiful you are. Mom giveth. Why do you have to cock it up with that hair? And Mom taketh away. You must be Will. Lovely to meet you. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Adler. You have a beautiful home. - Your interior decorator did a great job. - Oh, no no no no. I did it myself. No! It looks so professional. Oh, aren't you a darling? Your mom's good. No, you're good. Say hello to Julius, my arranger. - Hi. - Hell-ooh. So, Julius, what do we think about Will? I think where there's a Will, there's a way. Isn't he clever? Why some woman has never snatched him up is beyond me. - Where's daddy? - Uh, he's in Connecticut. Grandma Rose threatened to die. Joyce, your sister's here! Big whup! You get down here or I'll knock you till Tuesday! - Would you like a little juice? - I'm fine, thanks. Hi, Joyce. Don't you be all nice just 'cause your boyfriend's here. I know that you stole my poncho, you skank. Uh, Joyce, hi. I-I'm Will. Grace showed me that drawing of a unicorn you did at, uh, Camp Yes-I-Can. Yeah, it was beautiful. I wish I could draw like that. It's no big deal. - You've an older sister don't you? Janet? - No. Why don't you two go on upstairs and put your things down. Joyce, you'll stay down here. Will, you'll stay in Joyce's room. Grace, you'll stay in your room. What? No, Will's gonna sleep in my bedroom with me. - No, no, no, he isn't. - Grace, it--it's fine. Nooooo! Nooooo! Mom, you can't do that. This is so unfair. Well, so's my cottage cheese ass, but Why is that always your answer for everything? Will and I are adults. We've been going out for nearly three months now, - and I think that we should have-- - Grace! we only have two rules in this house. Number one: boys and girls don't sleep in the same bedroom, unless they're married. And Will, always light matches in the bathroom after poopie-doos. So, then, we have dinner, and we look at a zillion pictures of a nude 2-year-old Grace riding the family dog. Oh, you like that do ya? Well, maybe you'd like a little of this, huh? Yeah, you do, don't ya? Huh, huh? Karen, what are you do-- Are you-- Are you flashing that woman?! She started it. She's nursing. Hmm. That explains the little bald man. Anyway, later that night, I'm getting ready for bed, I figure, now I'm safe. Aahh! What--what Shh. Shh. Relax. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. Wha--you shouldn't be here, you know. We're gonna get in trouble. Not if we're quiet. But if you play your cards right, I might not be. What are you suggesting? Well, you, me A bed I thought that we might Don't make me say it. Grace, I don't know. - Mmm. Come on. What are we waiting for? - Well, I'm just-- I'm kind of tired. All that turkey Made me sleepy. Really? 'Cause it made me horny. - J-J-Just a sec. - But I said I was horny. Just a minute, I--I think those new potatoes weren't so new. Oh, poor baby. The matches are under the macramé turtle. Thank you. Mom, phone! Mom! Su-su-sussudio. Hi, Jack, it's-- it's Will Truman. Oh, right, from Queens College? No, I go to Columbia. Missy, anywhere you go is Queens College. Yeah, oh-- You know what? That-- That's why I called. You know, what you said really bugged me. I am not gay. Mom! There's chicken on the rug! I was saying That you--you know nothing about me, because if you did know me, you would know that I'm not gay. Oh, yeah. Now I get it. Ahem. You're in stage 3-- You've bought the short shorts, but you're afraid to put 'em on. Yeah, put 'em on, Will. Come on. Put 'em on. Stop saying that. Ok? I am not-- You're gay, Will! Ok? You're gayer than the day is long. You're Marvin Gaye. And let me tell you somethin'-- Ain't no closet big enough. This-- this is ludicrous. We spent all of four minutes together. Yeah, and in the first four seconds, I could tell that you were carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders And about 20 extra pounds on your hips. And why wouldn't you? It's a drag pretending to be something you're not. Yeah, if I'm pretending, then how come I can't wait to get back in there and have sex with my girlfriend? Well, if you can't wait to get back in there and make muskrat love to your girlfriend, then why are you on the phone with me? Yeah, that's what I thought. You're my new best friend. Call me every five minutes. Crap. Why today? Hi, I was starting to get worried about-- What-- What-- What's with you? Let's have some sex. Feel the heat. Pushing you to decide-- - Enough already! - Shut up! You were losin' her. I had to do somethin'. But you know, for a sultan, dude knew how to party. Later we did Jell-O shots with one of the guys from Hall and Oates. Hall? Oates. Back to my story. Honey, I've got some bad news. As much as I would love to be Mrs. Habibi Shoshani Padush Al-Kabir, I'm afraid I can't marry you. I'm just not in love with you. I'm in love with another man. Sure, he hasn't got your money, but I really think that with my help, we can make it work. Just come back to my house in Fort Lee and make love with me one more time. Sorry, sultan. I'm a little emotionally drained. I think I'm just gonna go home and cry myself to sleep. Karen, where have you been? I've been lookin' all over for you, baby. Oh, Clayton, I got some bad news. I can't marry you. I'm in love with another man. But does he have my moxie? Can he make love to you all night long? Well, the way he does it, he makes it feel like it's all night long, but I really think with my help, we can make it work. Karen, I don't know what to say. I'll never meet another woman like you. Oh That's so true. Listen, honey. I'm emotionally drained. I think I'm just gonna go home and cry myself to sleep. Oh, Martina. Karen, where have you been? I've missed you. Oh, honey, listen. I've got some bad news. I can't marry you. I'm in love with someone else. But, Karen, I was straight before I met you. Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles, Marti. Well, then who? And can she give you what I give you? You mean companionship, vitality, a sneaky drop shot? No, no. No, he's a doughy thing with squat little legs and a bad case of recurring psoriasis, but I love him, and with my help Oh! Who am I kidding? I just love him. Who knows why? I love Stanley Walker! Now that's a story! Ha ha! So Will comes back from the bathroom Right. So, Will comes out of the bathroom. We start getting into it. I take the lead, because you know, I've done it 3 1/2 times. - You're on my hair. - Oh, sorry. Mmm, you feel so-- - You're on my hair. - Sorry. Sorry. - You just elbowed me in the eye. - I'm sorry. Sorry. Ok. Just let me Oh! Ok, that's it. We're done with foreplay. Come here. Yeah. Aah! Stop! Stop! What? Are you ok? Yeah. I---I think we should wait. Noooo! Why? Are we ready? This is a really big step, and I just-- I don't want to-- I want it to be right. I don't want to rush into it. Oh, my God. Are you-- You are. What? I mean, I sort of suspected it. I mean, it certainly would explain a lot of-- - Oh, no, no! Oh, no! - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's ok. You don't have to feel bad. My dad was one all through the army. He-- What? You're a virgin. Virgin, yes. No! Oh, no! No, no, no, no. I'm definitely not a virgin. In fact, uh I've been known to be something of a lady man--Ladies man! Ladies man. Ha. A man! You know. Yeah. - Wellwell, then why are we waiting? - Because. But why? Because I love you. Oh, my God. You are so sweet. That's so like you to say it first. I love you, too. - Ok, I have to have you right now. - Whoa! No! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hold--hold--hold! - Didn't you hear me? I--I--I love you. - Yeah, yeah. Love you, too. Let's go. - Grace, Grace! - What? just-- God! I think we really, really should wait. Oh, but why? I mean, what are we doing? - Are we waiting till we're married? - Yes! - Let's get married! - What? Let's get married and let's wait till we get married. You want to get married? Oh, my god! Will. Yes, I will marry you, Will Truman. Well, great!   
                




                    			- Are you ok? - I'm fine. Grace, leave her alone. She obviously doesn't want to talk. It's my boyfriend, Tom. I mean, I don't know what happened. You know, just when things started to get kinda serious, he starts to pull away. Which is so weird because we have so much in common, like, we're both dance majors This is Karen Walker. This is Will Truman right here. And this is your sorry ass future, if you don't dump that boyfriend of yours. Oh, a-and you think everybody's gay. No, not everybody, just me And you and a dog named Boo. Hey, hey. Heh. I'm not gay. Well, this well-worn copy of the "Dreamgirls" soundtrack begs to differ. - What? - We really, really should wait. Oh, but why? I mean, what are we doing? - Are we waiting till we're married? - Yes! - Let's get married! - What? Let's get married and let's wait till we get married. Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 7 Lows in the Mid-Eighties part2 synchro: kingo You asked Grace to marry you? I panicked. It was either that or have sex with her. I mean, God! Put yourself in my-- Ok. Will, you know what I think your problem was? I think you were afraid of loving yourself. Where the hell did that come from? Can you see me? Anyway, the moment I said yes, he turned two shades of green and ran into the bathroom, which I found incredibly romantic, because my father did the exact same thing after he proposed to my mom. So I'm in there for, like, 20 minutes. So I come up with a perfect plan. Grace, I've been-- I've been-- Grace? I'm getting married in the morning ding dong, the bells are gonna chime, pull out the stopper, we'll have a whopper and get me to the shul on time. - Will! - Oh, there he is! Congratulations! Welcome to the family, son. I want her knocked up by spring. - Grace, we, uh, we need to talk. - Congratulation. - Thank you. - I've been engaged twice. Yeah. - Grace - Will, come on, come on. Meet everybody. Meet the mishpokhe. This is Aunt Ida, diabetic; Uncle Coppy, gambler. Aunt Reba and Uncle Joe-- colitis, colitis. If I could have one moment. Oh, moment shmoment. Give your new mother a big kiss right on the lips. Wh-- yeah. That was uncomfortable. Now give your new sister a kiss right on the lips. Here. Hold this. Oh, no, no, no, no! Stop. Stop. Everybody stop. - We need champagne. More champagne. - Yes. I'll go. Let me get that. In fact We'll get that. We'll get that. When we get married, I'm not only gonna take your name, I'm gonna take your family, too. I can't believe we're actually gonna do this. Yeah. Look, um I don't really know how to tell you this, so I'm just-- I'm just gonna tell you. Um, you know before when I said I loved you? I really, really meant that. I do love you. You're the best. I can't imagine my life without you. Well, now you never have to worry about that. Yeah, well, actually, I I'm feeling a little lightheaded. Um, see, there's this one teensy little complication Actually, not so teensy. I-- - I'm gay. - Are you hungry? - What? - What? - I'm gay! - Are you hungry?! - What?! - What?! - I'm g-- - Are you-- I'm gay. Grace? Hey, now. Not exactly the reaction I was expecting. You kill me. Oh, my God. Grace, I Oh, my God. - Grace, I can-- - Oh, my God! Grace When did you We're getting married. Yeah, you know, I don't think I can go through with that, either. I can't-- I don't even know-- How long have you known this? I--I think on some level I've always known. You know, I mean, the guy toweling himself off in the Zest commercial always did a little too much for me. Oh, great. Great. - The Zest guy knew before me. - No, no, no, no. Listen. That's not what I'm saying. I don't think I really knew for sure until we were in bed together. You know? And I took one look at you in your sexy underwear, and I just went "Whoa. I am gay." You know? I mean, do you know what I mean? - Yeah. Yeah, I think I do. - Yeah? Just--just one thing. Ow! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? You bastard! I'm in love with you, and you're treating me like some sort of test drive?! You take me out for a spin, and you go, "Hmm, I don't really like the feel of this one. I think I'd rather have a stick." But Don't you see what a compliment that is? I mean, I mean, I love you, so if I can't make it work with you, then it'll never work with any woman, because you're perfect for me. That is not a compliment. A compliment is "You're sexy, you turn me on," not "One look at you proves I'm a queer." Look, I understand that you're upset, but I mean, this is-- this is a very big step for me, you know? How about a little support here? Well, you probably would've gotten a lot more support from me if you hadn't asked me to marry you first. Ok. In hindsight, not a good move. Oh. Hindsight? Is that, like, one of your gay words? What? Look, I never meant to hurt you, but it's not like I planned to be gay. I heard yelling. Is everything ok? What's going on? - Nothing. - Will's gay. Oh, sweetie, oh. - Julius, I owe you 20 bucks. - Oh my God. What's going on? Nothing. Will's gay. Grace, you ruin everything! Get out. What? I want you to get your things, and I want you to leave. You know, I always knew this would be hard. I--I guess I just hoped that because it was you, it wouldn't be the worst moment of my life. Ok, so she threw you out? Then what happened? Well, then mother and I went to the DQ for some Brazier burgers and a Dilly Bar. High fat? High fun. Not you, Dairy Queen. She means us. Yeah, what happened? - Then, um - Then we didn't talk for a year. Good times. A whole year? You didn't talk for a year? What were you doing all that time? I was instrumental in bringing Cats over from London. Oh, not the musical. Ethan Katz, a Jewish hottie from Piccadilly. Oh, it's not me again? Grace didn't really want to deal with me, and I had a lot of my own stuff to deal with, you know, like telling everyone in my life who I really was. So, uh, have you been gay this whole time? Pretty much. Were you gay when you put that Coppertone on me in Fort Lauderdale? Yeah. Rob, I know what you're thinking, but I don't want you to worry. You know, last night when you passed out And I made love to you, I was totally straight. Then of course, I had to tell my mom and dad. And then I had to tell everyone in my life. How could I not have known? He was Boy George for Halloween. He has a diffuser on his blow-dryer. And he's prettier than me. Oh, baby. This must be so hard for you. It is. I knew you'd understand. For a guy to do that to you. It's humiliating. I would die. I would just die. You must not feel sexual Or pretty. Then there's that gnawing question. God, did I turn him gay? - I mean, am I so gross that-- - Ok. I get that you get it. - Think you'll ever talk to Will again? - Oh, no way. People already think I'm weird 'cause of my haircut. You add a gay friend to that, I might as well be a drama major. Man, I was so pissed at you. Pissed? Honey, you don't know the meaning of the word. If you'll remember, the last time we left the interesting story I had 3 different people dying to marry me, including a 9-time Wimbledon singles champion. And I left them all behind to be with the man I love, and then it turns out The bastard's married. Stan is married. Can you believe that? I had three different people dying to marry me, including a 6-time Wimbledon singles champion. Oh, shut your trap, barfly. What?! Who the hell are you? Listen, Boozo the clown You're bringing us down. If it was meant to be with this man, it was meant to be. Huh? Who asked you to pop your head out of your conch shell? If I want advice, I'm not gonna ask for it from a cigarette-slinging, tray-carrying, mint wrangler. - Listen, lady. If there wasn't so many, I'd bang your head - You better watch your mouth or I'll make one phone call - and crack your head like a walnut. - and get you on the next long boat to La Via de Los Tostadas. - I like you. Why don't you come work for me? - Ok. And although it was ten years before Stan and I officially hooked up, Rosario and I have been together ever since. Damn it! My story sucks, too. Anyway A year goes by, Thanksgiving rolls around again, and then one night at D'Agostinos Should we do sweet potatoes or mashed? Mashed, and I'm in love with you. What? Will, why are we pretending? We spend every second together. We call each other a hundred times a night. I saw the way you were lookin' at me the other day when we were at that place shoppin' for shoes. Look, Jack. I owe you everything, you know? I mean, this past year, coming out. You've been like my sherpard through the Himalayas of Of him-a-laying. But I just don't feel that way about you, you know? I love you the way you love a cherished family pet. That you never want to have sex with. We're meant to be girlfriends, not boyfriends, you know? It's better that way. Brava. You've passed the test. I was worried your feelings might get in the way of our friendship, but I'm glad we've cleared that up. I really had you goin' there with the "I'm in love with you thing," didn't I? Yeah, you did. Me, in love with you. Me, in love with you? Ha! Craziness. If you'll excuse me, I'll be in the frozen foods section. It thought it'd be nice if we started Thanksgiving with some Jeno's eggrolls. Will. Grace, hi. Hi. How have you been? Good. Great. I've been great. You? Great. Great, uh, haven't seen you in months. It's been a year. I moved off campus. Why'd you do that? People kept writing "Grace plus Liberace" on my memo board. You still mad at me? I'm not mad at you. I mean on some level I knew. - You did? - Yeah. I mean, girls know. I knew. Well, if you knew, why didn't you tell me? We could've saved ourselves a hell of a lot of-- I didn't really know. I just swore that when I ran into you, I would say that. You know, I left about a dozen messages. And I wrote you a letter. Did you get the letter? - Wait a minute. What was that? - What? That woman that you were hiding from. What was that all about? Well, the last thing he wanted to do was run into Diane. Heh. Yeah. So, uh, then we, um We made up, and we have been best friends ever since. Right, sweetie? - Right. - Well, you're all boring and I'm fun. I better get back to the kids. Smell you later. Who's Diane? You know, the girl Will slept with after you two broke up. What? You know, the kids will be fine. I cracked a window in the limo. You knew that. You've told her. You didn't know that? You didn't tell her? What-- What is he talking about? Nothing. It was this-- This girl-- Listen, it was nothing. Anyway, best friends! Huh? Don't. Will, don't--don't. Grace. Grace! When I get home, I'm gonna rip your heart out through your foot. Oh. We should do this every year. Are they coming back, because I still don't understand what this story has to do with me and Tom. Oh, cripes. Honey, let me give it to you in a nutshell. Your boyfriend's a big flaming feather-wearing, man-kissing, disco-dancing Vermont-living, Christina Aguilera-loving, Mikanos-going-- Honey, take it on home. - Tom's queer, dear. - Merry Christmas! Would you hang on, please? Gracie! - How come you didn't tell me? - Because I thought it would upset you. - Well, it did. - Well, that's why I didn't tell you. You're unbelievable. 15 years later, and you're still lying to me. - Need a cab, miss? - No. - I was gonna get around to telling you. - When? - Right after you found out. - That's not even funny. - Why is this such a big deal? - Because I thought that I was the one - that helped you come out. - You were! - I thought that I was the one that changed your life. - You did! I thought it was my naked body that did nothing for you! It didn't! It still doesn't! - Don't try to make me feel better. - Grace, come inside. I don't want to come inside! - Taxi? - No! After what happened with us, I--I was little percent hanging over me, so I I met this woman at a party, we got stinking drunk, went back to her room-- it was awful. So it could have been awful with me. Why didn't you make it awful with me? Because I love you. I cared about you. I--I--I-- I didn't want to put you through that. I needed to try it with someone I didn't love. It was awful, huh? Beyond awful. Remember that nature special with the elephant seals flopping all over the place? I needed to picture the cute guy that hosted that show just to make it through. Ok, is this it? Or are there any other sordid heterosexual stories I should know about? I swear, like walking through the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant-- something I only needed to try once. - Cab, lady? - No! God, it's amazing. When you need one, you can never get one, - and then when you don't-- - Actually, you know, Grace, um it's raining and we're 40 blocks from home. We--we did need one. Taxi? Come on. So we ok? We will be. Are we ok? We will be.   
                




                    			- Hey, how was your date last night? - Don't wanna talk about it. - That bad? - That good. I don't get that. I'm not jinxing it this time. Every time I have a good first date, the second one sucks, and there is no third. So, the only logical thing to do is not talk about it. Very logical, Mr. Spock. Date well and prosper. - You're crazy. - Fine. Call me superstitious. - Let's talk about your date. - What? And jinx it? No thank you. - We can mention their names, right? - Absolutely not. - Mark. - Paul-- but that's it. Fine. Give any more details We're doomed. But if you guessed-- But how could I possibly? - Minty. - Fresh breath? Ding. Huge. - You said "first date"? - Right. - Vocabulary. - Ding! - Broad - Way? No, not Broadway, you homo. Broad shoulders. Met mine at that party with Jack last week. Ditto on the shoulders, and my larynx didn't shut down from his cologne, which is all I care about. - So we didn't jinx anything, right? - Course not. Oh, boy. Ok, gotta hurry. I've got a dermatology appointment. Are you gonna get a little botox, a little collagen? No. Just going for my regular mole patrol. Why? Do you think I need that? No. Morning, biscuits. No time for host chat. I got a hot date tonight. Told him I was an ombudsman. I only have 12 hours to figure out what the hell that is. Grace, I came by to return your electric toothbrush. You used my toothbrush? Relax. I didn't use it on my teeth. Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 9 Three's a Crowd, Six is a Freak Show synchro: kingo This video game makes a nice birthday gift. Do you think your stepson would like that? I don't know, honey. Can he eat it or rub up against it? Let's come at this a different way. What are his interests? Ham. - Why don't I just let you browse awhile? - Yeah. Thanks. Ooh, and, uh, do you think there's anything you could do about all these kids in here? - Ma'am, it's a toy store. - Yeah. See what you can do. Move it, shorty. Hi, Karen. Um I can't help you shop today. I've gotta go. Honey, what's going on? What's happening? What's with the geisha hand? Nothing. I just had something zapped at the dermatologist's, and it looks kinda funky, and I just don't want anyone to see it right now. Grace, I'm sure it's not nearly as bad as you think it is. It's probably nothing, a little dot. Come on. Show mama. Shhhhh! Karen, Will you calm down? How do you expect me to calm down when I can see its heart beating right in front of me?! Alright. Alright, I'm sorry. So how long have you had the herpes? It's not herpes. It's not even herpes adjacent. Oh, yeah? Well, it's close enough to be invited to the herpes family picnic. It was a weird freckle, and the doctor wanted to freeze it, and then he told me that it was going to take 10 days to heal. I mean, what made him assume that I could look awful for 10 days? Respond to that, and I will rub it all over your Prada. What are you lookin' at, prego? Haven't you ever seen herpes before? Jeez. Fat people are so insensitive. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Would you look at it in this little toy mirror? It's gottenbigger. It's like Barbie's dream zit. Thank God I canceled my date with Mark. Yeah, 'cause that thing looks like it needs orange cones and police tape around it. Come on. Let's get outta here-- And there's Mark! I can't believe it! One cheeseburger at Yom Kippur! You'd think you could let it go already. Hey, he's lookin' at baseball gloves. What do you know, Grace? You bagged a straight one. Karen-- Karen, just don't move. Just don't move. Grace I told you, I only did this once in college, and it was just so I could borrow her Halston skirt. Paul? - Hi. - Will, hi. What are you doing here? I live here. What do you mean, what am I-- Aren't you here to see-- - No, I was here to see-- - Paul, you forgot your Look, uh, this is kinda awkward, but, uh, at that party I asked for both of your phone numbers. I hope that's not a problem, because it's not a problem for me. No. Ok, Will, I'll see you Monday at the Plaza, and, Jack, I'll see you Tuesday at Shakey's. All-you-can-eat. Don't shake your head at me! I called dibs on him at that party! Jack, how am I supposed to keep track? You call dibs on every guy you see. Last week you called dibs on Kevin Bacon. Le Bacon and I had a moment. Some say "moment." Some say "security incident." - Anyway, Paul is into me. - Oh, please! He is so much more into me. We had an 8-hour date, which I know is hard for you to understand, seeing as you have 8 dates an hour. Yeah? Well, date shmate. We have a song. What song? You wouldn't know it. Sing it. Hee bop dee-bop bop, I love you. Paul loves me, and not you. Catchy little ditty. Who does that song, the lady who pushes her shopping cart around the airport? Actually, it's a new band called "Will is Fat." It's from their new album, Will's Losing His Hair. Do you? I have it in my Jack Do you think when you insult me that you could try to be a little more artful, hmm? You bucktoothed fairy? - You know what?! I don't need that from you! - Jack, jack, jack! Let's not do this, ok? I mean, we're both adults. You're the adult. Look, for the sake of our friendship, can we both just back off and not see Paul again? But I love him. You do not. Maybe I'm just in love with love. Maybe you're just an idiot. Maybe - Can we agree we're not gonna see him again? - Oh, all right. But this is not gonna be easy for me, Will. I mean, Paul is my world. I can't stop thinking about him. - Have you seen the latest Men's Health? - Hello, Mrs. McFarland. Grace? Grace, where are you? Is he gone? Is he gone? Oh, honey, no! Children have been in there. You're in a pit full of pinkeye. This is ridiculous. I mean, what's the worst thing that can happen? He breaks up with me. Well, if he's that superficial, then don't want to be with him anyway, right? Well, I'm gonna go. He's right over there. I'm just gonna get the kid the same thing I got him last year: a diamond tennis bracelet. It's pretty, isn't it? Mark? Hey. Hey, Grace. Uh, I was just picking up a Nerf hoop for my nephew, and by nephew, I mean me. I thought you were out of town. I lied to you. I'm not taking a dozen underprivileged kids on a canoe trip. I canceled because I was afraid to see you because I had this freckle frozen and it looks awful and I was afraid that if you saw it, you wouldn't like me anymore. Well, that would make me pretty shallow, wouldn't it? Grace, I had a great time with you. I really like you. Really? 'Cause I really like you. Yeah, and besides, we all have little things on our bodies, right? Right. I mean, you probably have What? A patch of dry skin somewhere A rogue belly hair I have six toes. Beg your pardon? You're breaking up with Mark already? What are you talking about? Few days ago, you were gaga over him. You know how it is. Sometimes you get bowled over by somebody--- Don't say "gaga"-- And then you get to know them, and you realize that maybe you don't like them so much. Hey, Wilma. Grace tell you she's dating a circus freak? - What?! - Karen. Yeah. He's got six toes. Wait! What do you mean, like, total? - Like three and three? - No. Five on one, half a dozen on the other. Ok. Hey, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay! - Cut it out! - That's what he should do. Ah! I'm sorry. I can't--I can't help it. I'm totally creeped out by it in the same way that I'm creeped out by anything that ends in mini-teeth or mini-hair. - Here comes the tumor thing. - On the Discovery Channel, they found a tumor in this guy, and it had mini-teeth and mini-hair. And when they poked it, the tumor went "Ow." - It did not say, "Ow." - Well, if it'd had mini-lips, it would've. It moved. That thing had emotions. It had emotions, Will, and this toe thing is in that same category. Aren't you being a little shallow? I mean, you like this guy. Look, when you first got that barnacle on your face, you wanted Mark to accept you, right? Now shouldn't you do the same thing now that the shoe's on the other hideously deformed foot? I'm serious. You should go out with him again. He is sweet. Anyway, it could be worse. You could be going out with the same guy as Jack. Paul? With the huge Vocabulary? Yeah. But it's over already. We both decided to back off. Which is very frustrating because he's called me, like, 10 times. Well, then what are you doing? - Backing off. - Why? - Because I owe it to Jack to-- - All you owe Jack is the truth. He's your friend. He wants you to be happy. He'll totally understand. You know what? You're a piece of work, mister! - I didn't wanna lie to you. - Why not? I wouldn't have done the same thing to you! I mean time and time again-- Jack, please. Please. I know you're angry, but I beg of you. Take it out of the head voice. You're waking up every dog in the neighborhood. How could you betray me like this? We had a deal, and you stabbed me in the back. Judas. You're Judas. This is exactly what he did! Mmm Don't know that the big problem there was a gay love triangle. Don't change the subject. I can't believe you called him after we agreed to back off. Actually, Jack, he-- He called me. - I don't believe you! - Eh, Jack! Think of the dogs. You know what? You're a real piece of work, mister. I can only imagine what kind of tricks you had to pull out of your man purse to convince Paul to date you. What? What? What? What did you tell him, you were a lawyer? - I am a lawyer. - Hey! I'm not attracted to you, so that line's not gonna work on me. You so don't care about my feelings, ever. Jack, he called. He said he rather go out with me. I said, "Yes." I'm sorry. You know, it just doesn't make any sense, Will. It's none-sense. Why would he settle for a big bland piece of government cheese when he could take a bite out of a tasty smoked gouda with a trick jaw? Maybe because I read novels rather than Tiger Beat Maybe because I can finish a sentence without the use of jazz hands Maybe because my frame of reference extends beyond boy bands and butt-robics, or maybe, just perhaps, it's because he sees a good long-term prospect with me rather than a good hour and a half with you. - So what would you like to drink? - Well, what have you got? - Everything. - Surprise me. My dad's the Pope. Surprised? Ok, I'm charming. I finally got to use that Pope joke. This is going well. I'm not so shallow. Ooh, Grace, would it be ok if I caught the last few minutes of the Knicks/Celtics game? Are you kidding? I love basketball. I read all of Dennis Rodman's books. What are you doing? Do you mind if I take off my shoes? The right one always gets a little tight. Not at all. Make yourself comfortable. And there's the toe. There's now just a thin layer of argyle between it and me. - Ow! Ow! Ow, my foot is cramping. - Well, if you have to go home, I understand. Actually, I was wondering if you could just Rub it? Rub your tumor? Sure. What?! That is not a 3-pointer. His toe is clearly over the line. One toe over the line, sweet Jesus. So for the whole flight, this annoying guy has been like, "When are we gonna get the muffins, huh? Where's my muffin?" So the stewardess finally brings the muffins, and the guy is so excited, he starts doing the Snoopy dance. So he gets up to wash his hands, and I don't know what made me do it, but, um, I stole his muffin. I thought his-- I thought his head was gonna explode. "My muffin!" Great story. I can't see you anymore. Ow! Ow! Ow! My cramp's still there. I'm gonna take my sock off. Ok, brace yourself. Here it comes. Just stay calm. You like this guy. You're not shallow. A little thing like this doesn't matter. It's just an extra toe. What you thinkin'? That we need more drinks. Excuse me. Ok, you did it. You saw it. You lived through it. Everything's fine. Then why do I feel so cold and clammy? Oh, right. The fridge is still open. See? It's sitting there in your lap, and you're fine. You're not superficial. You're not a hypocrite. Good for you, Grace. Good for you. Yes! Ye-es! The Celts win. - What? You're a Celtics fan? - Huge. Get out. What? Look, I can put up with a lot of things from people, but not that! What? Grace, are you kidding me? I will not have a 6-toed Celtics fan in my house! - A what? - You heard me! I will not have a Celtics fan in my house! Please leave! Oh, Grace, this isn't about the basketball game. We know what this is about. How shallow can you be? Ok, fine. I'm shallow. But if you knew how much I liked you, you would know how much it is killing me to throw you out of here just because you have a toe where no toe should ever be. How about a little sympathy for me? Are you kidding me? You want me to feel sorry for you? No. I want you to put your sock back on. Ok, fine. Oh, and, by the way, here's your freckle. I almost tripped over it on my way to the elevator. Good night. Oh, yay. I can wear lipstick again. - Hey. - Hi. I've been calling you for two hours. Why didn't you pick up? - Um, look-- - I know. I know. You're still mad at me. You'll be happy to know that Paul and I are no longer seeing each other. I mean, the thing is, you know, I'm on this date, and he's funny, and he's charming, and I'm miserable because I can't stand that I hurt you. So you see, I do care about how you feel. That's sweet. Thank you. You know, I'm sorry we fought, too, and, hey, let's make a deal never to fight over a guy again. - Deal. - Ok. Alright. Good night. Good night. Oh, hey, uh, Will Uh, you know I--I was bad, too And, Oh, boy, this is really hard for me to say. I'll just I borrowed your stockpot-- - Who's out there? - Nobody, Paul-- And I think I broke it. - Is that Paul in there?! - Yeah. - Jack? - One sec, sugar! Anyway I mean, you're probably better off without it. You only used it to make cream-based soups, right? Night. You know what? You're a piece of work, mister! You know why this happened, don't you? We jinxed it. You're right. We can never again talk about guys we like. Never. - I saw a cute guy takin' out the trash. - There were some hotties at the restaurant. - But we're not talking about it. - No, we're not.   
                




                    			Hang on! Hang on. Will, when you came out of the closet, you weren't supposed to take all of your clothes with you. Help me! What are you dressed for? Open-heart surgery? Will, admit it. If you were straight, you'd be all over me. Grace, if I was straight, you'd be getting the dry cleaning. - So, your, uhtotal comes to 41 bucks. - Oh, thanks. I'll get ya next time. - You said that last time. - But I didn't mean it last time. I mean it this time. Funny, I believed you last time. I don't believe you this time. Oh--oh, ok, we're supposed to meet Joe and Larry in 15 minutes. We should boogie. Don't dance. Don't say boogie. Can you believe it? They're getting married in four days. I love weddings. Well, it's not strictly a wedding; it's a same-sex civil union, which affords many of the same rights as a marriage. Right. Where are they going on their honeymoon? Well, it's not strictly a honeymoon; it's a same-sex vacation with a lot of the same events as a honeymoon. Hey, friends, lovers, mothers, and other strangers. You're never going to believe what happened to me. Oh, my gosh! Did you see that? I almost did the half nelson. I almost bruised my delicates, my delicates, my domo arigato Mr. Tomatoes. Huge news! I have met-- Are you ready for this? Mr. Right. Well, Mr. Right-Now, anyway. Ba-da-bum! Good night, folks, I'm here all week. Jack 2000! He works over at the Jumpin' Java. You know that coffee shop on 72nd? And his name is Paul. He is cute with a capital "Q"! And the busier it gets, the hotter he gets. And the hotter he gets, the sweatier he gets. And the sweatier he gets-- I forgot where I'm going with this, but the point is Me likey he, and he likey me. And the best part is--Shazam-- he gives me free iced coffee every time I go in, which is every hour on the hour. Thank you very much! And occasionally on the half hour! Bah-da-da-da-da! Blblblbt! Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 10 Coffee & Commitment synchro: kingo So I know we've shown you a thousand pictures of our baby, but how cute is Hannah with a pacifier in her mouth? Oh, wow! I actually took a similar photo of Jack But the--the photo place wouldn't develop it. Will, switch with me. - W-well, we got the same dessert. - I know, but it's our thing. - We always switch halfway through. - But you're all the way through! Just switch. You guys are so cute together. Are we? Yeah, very! Well, he's freaking out a little. In four days, he's not allowed to look at another man. Listen, we wanted to ask you guys if you would consider doing a reading together at our ceremony. Oh, my god! Oh! Oh, I've got the perfect thing. We did this bit at my parents' 40th anniversary w-with puppets and a boom box. See, they were puppets who rapped. It killed! Do you remember? It killed! But--but a reading's good. Well, we want to include everyone, and all our closest friends and family are doing one. - Even your bitter sister. - Larry! Well, of course we'll do it. We'd love to. "Yo, yo, yo, this anniversary's phat!" Remember? It--I'm telling you, it--it-- Well, whatever you want. - Uh-uh. Our treat. - Grace-- No, come on, come on, let us do this. Really, I mean, this is a special occasion. If we can't take our dear friends out for dinner-- Really, it would mean so much to us. - Thank you, guys. - Our pleasure. - Put it on your Visa. - Wh--? - My Visa? - Yeah, we could use the miles. Oh, and I'm taking some cash for the coats. I didn't get to the ATM. Oh, and leave a big tip. He was really sweet. He's the only guy at this table who looked at my chest. Hey, Jackie Brown. Why isn't there any coffee?! Same reason you don't have a wife and three kids. It's the way God wants it. Damn it, this is an office! There should be coffee! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Why don't you save your anger for the bedroom, where it belongs? Why don't you go see your little coffee cutie, huh? Your latte lover. Mr. Jock-full-of-nuts. He quit, all right? What is this? The freaking inquisition? Can't a guy have a nice, hot cup of coffee when he wants, or do we all live in "Tea Land" where it's a capital crime to even say the word "coffee"? Ok, jitterbug, get a hold of yourself. Don't tell me to get a hold of myself. I'm fine! Ok, you may wanna take a look in the mirror because you got a little crazy on your face. Ok? Oh, my God. Karen, what's happening to me? Well, I'm no expert, but I think you have a little addiction problem. No tears on the damask. Addiction? Oh, no. No, no! I don't have an addiction, thank you very much. - Ok, ok. - I'm fine, I'm fine. Now, listen to me. The first thing you have to do is admit that you have a problem. Because if you can't even recognize the signs Then you are really in sorry shape. Why are you so good to me? Karen, I can't do it. I'm hooked on the junk. Well, honey, if it'll help you, I'll do it with you, ok? I'll kick coffee, too. Yeah! It won't be easy, but every morning when I wake up, I'll just have to get used to drinking my Bailey's straight. It'll still be the best part of waking up. Ok, Karen. Ok. Together we can do this. Let me just have one last cup. - No. - Half a cup. - No. - How about you drink a cup and I'll lick your tongue? - Tempting, but no. Ok, come here. Right here. Oh, Karen, when will the lambs stop screaming? Hey! Oh! Is this our gift for Joe and Larry? - It's a gift, yes. - What is it? It's a crystal decanter. But I couldn't find any paper, so I wrapped it in a kayak. It's a kayak. Oh, that is so perfect! Ok, where's the card? I'll sign it. - I already signed the card. - Oh, you didn't sign for me, did you? Your handwriting has a serial killer's slant. I didn't sign your name at all, Grace, because it's from me. I don't get it. I'm tired of being the one who pays. What? You always assume I'm gonna take care of everything, and then you take all the credit, I mean, not to mention the Advantage miles. You know, blowing 20,000 points on a first class to Schenectady. W-what is that anyway? Y-you sit on the pilot's lap? Jeez, sorry. I thought you liked paying. Oh, that's right! I do like paying. Yeah, that's why I do the cancan every time I read the gas bill. Ok, you've made your point. How much was the kayak? I'll write you a check for half. - $400. - Can I write you a check for a third? You see, this is what I'm talking about. And it's not just the kayak. It's the dinners, and the dry cleaning, and on more than one occasion, your bikini wax. Had a fun time explaining that one to my accountant. I cannot believe you are springing this on me an hour before we have to go. How am I supposed to find a gift? Hey, it's your own fault for assuming that I would take care of everything. And by the way, you only have five minutes. Fine! You know what? I'm resourceful. I'll make a gift. - You'll what? - Yes, that's right. You've left me absolutely no time, but I once threw togethera dinner party for eight with nothing in the fridge but mustard and a roll of film. Yeah, and all we have to remember that evening is double prints of eight angry people getting sick eating mustard soup. Never mind. I'll take care of my own gift, and it'll be totally separate from yours. In fact, why stop at the gift? Why don't we make everything separate? Why not? That pint of mocha almond fudge, you still have it? The what? Hello, dark roast, my old friend. Drop that spoon, Billie Holiday! I've kept you caffeine-free for two hours. You're not folding now! Get away from me, you lamé and ermine-wearing monster! - I'll drop it, I swear. - No, you won't. You don't have the guts! You know me too well. Out of my way! I've got a monkey on my back named Juan Valdez! Don't worry, kids. On the ride up to Vermont, I'll have him in a dog carrier with a chew toy. By the way, what's going on here? I'm sensing a mood. - He thinks I'm taking advantage of-- - Yeah, save it, honey. We'll crack it open later when we're desperate. It's so cold. So very, very cold. Yeah, it is kind of nippy in here. Hey, pops, why don't you crank up the heat? The girls are in full salute back here. It's up as high as it will go. God, any hotter and my calves'll be brisket. Jack never has a second cup at home. Somebody fill me to the rim with brim. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. How much for one mint? - Oh, Grace, just take it. - No, no, no, we agreed to split everything, so that's what we're gonna do. These are your mints so tell me-- - Fine. $100. - Ok. Hey, careful! You almost broke my present for Joe and Larry. Where did you get that anyway? The Blair Witch gift shop? It's an imprint of my hand in cement surrounded by a nest of twigs. I made it when I was 12 at Camp Rema. It's real, it's unique, and it's from the heart. Aw, can I see that, honey? - Thanks. - Karen! No! What, you think my gift is funny? I think it's funny you call it a gift. We're here at New York's finest restaurant, and we've replaced Jack's coffee with nothing! Oh, look at that. Two miles to the next toll. That means I owe you $1.62. Ok, well, look, hey, if we're gonna do that, let's go all the way. Uh, I bought a full tank of gas, you used three of my Kleenexes and two applications of my Carmex. That means you owe me roughly $22.57. Do you take a check or should I pay you in pettiness, Mr. Petty? Tom Petty? Petticoat petty? Peppermint petty? Bite me! Ohh, just climb on top of each other and get it over with already! Lord. Honey, look, what is that? Oh, it's a beaver. Sweet! Didn't think we'd be seeing any of those at a gay wedding. - So how you holding up, sweetie? - Pretty good, pretty good. I--I think the last couple hours in the car really got me over the hump. - Good for you. - Thanks. Hey, bow tie. Bring me a cup of vodka. And none of that tax-free swill. I want the good stuff. - Uh, ma'am, there is no alcohol. - Sure there is. Uh, no, there isn't. This is a dry weeding at the groom's request, but there is a full coffee bar with a variety of coffee drinks and coffee-flavored treats. Enjoy. Would you look at this? What a shame. A table full of hollow gestures. I mean, why would Joe and Larry want a $400 place setting of Italian dinnerware? - Yeah - Oh, my God! That's genius! A gag gift! They're gonna totally crack up. What did you really get them? A $400 kayak. Put my name on that card or I'll kick your ass. - No. You have your gift. - I can't give them this stupid twig plate. It smells like mouse poop. - Damn it, Will-- Hi! - Hi guys! - You look so good! We're so happy for you. - How's the blushing bride? Oh, pretty good, you know, considering we don't know which one of us is the bride. Hey, everyone, how are you? Hi. - Hey, did you give them the thing? - It's right-- Because we have to be out of here by 11:00 on the dot. And it's getting late and if we don't start soon-- Larry, baby, we're fine. Just breathe. It's our day. You're right. I'm sorry. I am telling you, if I didn't have this one Do you still wanna marry me? Over and over and over. He's definitely the bride. Here's the reading, and it's pretty self-explanatory, but you might wanna go over it before we start, which is now. Ok, that's what nervous feels like. Come on, Grace, we better get our-- Grace! - Come on, what's the big deal? - Well, for one thing I don't think that "Joel and Shirley Goodman" are gonna be so keen on having your name on their card. Second of all, I said no. - Why are you being such a freak about this? - I already told you. - I told you that I would pay. - Tough! - Why? - Because I don't want a wife! What are you talking about? Wife? And don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you! Honey, we gotta bust out of here! Maybe I can get Stan to land the heli by the gazebo and airlift us to the Dewar's plant. - Karen, we have to at least stay for the ceremony. - The hell we do! I'm gonna kill Rosario! The one morning she forgets to strap on my boot flask. - Would you take it easy? - Don't tell me to take it easy! I'm looking at a room full of outlet clothing and Fantastic Sam's haircuts! I can't breathe, I tell you, I can't breathe! Would you get a hold of yourself? Would either of you care for a cup coffee? - Yes! - No! I'm your wife? That is possibly the most vicious thing you have ever said to me. And I'm including the time I got a root perm and you called me pubic head. - Get a grip on yourself! - You get a grip on yourself! Look, the only way we're gonna get through this is if we support each other, all right? Maybe you're right. I guess we can get our minds off of things by touching each other inappropriately. Good idea. You might as well be my wife. What? "Marcus Welby's my wife"? No! You might as well be my wife, deaf-o. I can't hear anything over that farkhakhte harp. What a wonderful day, and what a wonderful couple. It's always "Will and Grace." Will and Grace buy the present. Will and Grace do the speech. "We cordially invite Will and Grace." why don't they ever say "Will and guest"? - Well, who did you want to bring? - I don't know! One of the Gap dancers, Aquaman, anyone! - Well, who's stopping you? - You are! Because you're so content to play Mrs. Will Truman. I want a husband. I want someone who loves me, a-and a family. I want this, not this! I do not know where you got the idea that I am your wife, but let me tell you something, if that's true, we've got big martial problems because Mrs. Truman's getting a lot of action on the side. And now I' like to call upon your friends here who have some words they'd like to share with you. Jack? Hi, I'm Jack, and I'm addicted to full-flavored iced coffee drinks. Whew! It does feel better to get it out. No, zippy, read your thing! Joe, Larry, I did a little rewrite. I hope you don't mind. Ahem. Joe, Larry, what's love S'got to do, s'got to do with it? - What's love-- - Thank you. Now we'll hear from Joe's sister Jean. I am so happy for my brother. Everyone thought I'd be the first to find a man, but, no, that didn't happen. But he has found true-- Heh! Just give me a second. I don't have to explain this to you, ok? I just know this is not working. Ok, got it. You've made yourself passive-aggressively clear. Call in the lawyers. We're getting a divorce. - Which I'm sure I'll pay for. - Let it go! Guys? When I'm feeling like there's no love coming to me And I have no love to give When I'm feeling separated from the world And cut off from myself When I'm feeling annoyed by every little thing Because I'm not getting what I want I'll remember that there is an infinite amount of love available to me. And I'll see it in you. I'll remember that I am complete within myself So I'll never have to look to you to complete me. And most of all, I'll remember that everything I really need I already have, and whatever I don't have will come to me when I'm ready to receive it. Oh, my God. I am so sorry. Me, too. - I love you. You know that, right? - I know. - Don't you? - I do. - And you know I love you, right? - I do. Thanks for coming! Guys? Hey, guys! Guys! We're not really done here. Oh, they're beautiful. Thank you, Maggie. What do you think of the cake? Are you kidding? It's got nine layers of chocolate and a Snickers bar in the middle. I may move into it. So are we-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. It's just Chalk it up to my pre-mid-life crisis. Does that mean another one's on the way? And is it going to be worse? I guess weddings just bring out the worst in me. I mean, I see them so happy and in love and it just Makes me bitter. Is that an awful thing to say? I wouldn't put it in your toast later. You know that someday you are gonna make someone a beautiful bride or husband. Or brusband. Whatever. - Promise you'll give me away? - Gladly. "To Joe and Larry, love, Will and Grace." Thank you! I knew you'd love it! I mean, he's my younger brother. I should be the one wearing white today. Or at the very least deodorant. Guess what? Rule number one at a wedding-- Find a sad sister, you found the booze. I myself am proud to say that I'm not going to indulge. - You know, I've finally kicked my coffee habit. - Really? Yeah, I mean, I got hooked on the stuff because of some guy. Now I know I'm not going to let any man lead me down that dirty road again. - Excuse me, do you have a light? - Uh, yes, I do. - Thanks. You smoke? - Yes, I do.   
                




                    			Well, hello, Miss Crept-in-at-3:00-A.M.-slept-in-her-dress. Somebody obviously ended the evening with a bang. No, just a little French kissing. Oh, what? With that guy who kept going around the party saying, "it's all good." No. He bugged the crap out of me. He kept asking me why I wouldn't smile I finally had to tell him it was because I was born without smiling muscles like that kid in Wisconsin. That's good. I once told someone I couldn't have sex with them because cause Jupiter was in my rising house. I know It was me. You lie a lot, you know that? You are a very big liar, Grace Adler. I am not. I never lie. Could you sign my doctor's name on this? I'm trying to get out of jury duty. Come on. Come on, sign it. He gave me some stationery and told me I could write whatever I want on it. "Borderline personality disorder"? "High-risk for psychotic break, particularly in a stressful situation." You left out your tendency to not flush if it's just pee. You are a disgrace, Margaret Truman! A disgrace. Don't think that we didn't see you and your big forehead sneaking out of that party last night. Please. It was boring, and then some three-foot-tall guy kept following me around begging me to come back to his apartment to show me his Lion King memorabilia. When's the last time some guy offered to show you his Pumbaa? You can't exactly afford to be choosy. Even Grace was smooching that loser all night who kept saying, "it's all good." - I thought you said - I lied. I am telling you, you're gonna blink and you'll be 80 and alone in a caftan with a lap full of catnip saying "Here, kitty, kitty, kitty." It's time to put the "sex" back in "homosexual," Will! So get a freakin' boyfriend! P.S., I ruined your new shirt, let's see a movie later! - Don't listen to him. - Why not? He's right. I have no one in my life, and why? Because there's no one I'm interested in. Oh, now, that's a lie. You're the liar, Will, not me. Oh, God, that's what hurts. What about that cutie that you met at Banana Republic? The guy whose card you've been dating for the last two months? What are you What card? Matt's card. No, I don't think it's gonna work out, anyway. He's kinda square. You get it? He's kinda No wonder I'm alone. - Call him. - I can't. - Give me one good reason. - Because he's a sportswriter. He writes about sports. - That is a good reason. - Thank you. Wait a minute What are you What are you saying? That I couldn't go out with a sports guy? God, no. Better you stick to dating his card. In fact, I just got a new Texaco card. Maybe we could double. - I'm gonna call him. - I think it's a bad idea. - Well, I'm doing it. - I wouldn't. You just totally manipulated me into that, didn't you? It's all good. Grace, we have a favor to ask you. As you know, I recently acquired a prime piece of real estate in the greater Manhattan area. - I gave you my apartment. - Whatever. Anyway, my fair-bosom friend here has generously offered to foot the bill to redecorate my little pomme de terre. I see where this is going. We were hoping you would. And since this is your area of expertise And we really need a good designer We were hoping God, this is kind of hard to ask. Do you know any? Why isn't she speaking? She's thinking. Quick, grab a pencil. Be ready to write down whatever she says. She's not saying nothing. That's because she's hypnotized by her own dress. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why don't we ask Grace to do it? Is she any good? Boris, Natasha, I'm right here. Excuse me. We're having a private conversation. Nosy parker. Speaking of which, I'd love to park my nosey in that scarf of yours. Do it quick. So, will you do it? I wouldn't do it if you paid me twice my fee. - How about if I pay you twice your fee? - I'll do it. So, what took you so long to call me? That's sort of my style. I like to wait, you know until the guy has lost all interest in or memory of me, and then I strike. Well, it worked for me. Look, they're showing last year's all-star game. Pedro Martinez is the best pitcher in baseball, don't you think? Don't tell me you're a Johnson fan? I'm a big Johnson fan. You want another beer? Yeah, two more, please. Sorry. I love sports. I always wanted to be a sportscaster. When I was a kid I used to hold my mother's curling iron and pretend I was Howard Cosell. That's funny. You know, when I was a kid I used to hold my mother's curling iron and pretend I was Eartha Kitt. But, you know, you should pursue it. You'd be great. Well, actually, I've got a meeting next week for an on-air position at Channel 9. That's great. Yeah. I just love that you're into this. The last guy I dated hated sports. You know, since you're a baseball fan, you should join my buddies and me. We get a game going every Saturday in the park. You interested? Absolutely. I-I-I-- You know, I miss playing. - What's your position? - I'm for it. Now, since we're dealing with limited space I thought we would play off that and go big, overstuff it but not excessively, smartly. I like it. Let's go exactly the opposite. So you want to understuff it stupidly? See God in everyone. I've taken the liberty to pull some pictures from magazines to give you an idea of what I'm looking for. These are pictures from an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog of men lying around with their underwear half off their asses. Can you do that? Jack, do I have to explain the difference between a decorator and a pimp again? There you are. I just got the estimate for the job, and let me tell you something no one takes advantage of Karen Walker Except Stan Walker, and at least he has the courtesy to kiss me and buy me jewelry before he gives me the low, soft one. You said that money was no object. Honey, that's just a saying, like, "Ooh, that sounds like fun" or, "I love you." Listen Listen, Stan got wind of this, and he's taking the money out of my shoe allowance so I was hoping you could do the whole thing for, say, under $300 dollars. Are you insane? Jack's got expensive taste The musical bidet alone is over 400. Well, that's your problem, not mine. Just strip it down to the bare essentials Rubber walls, a baby-oil dispenser and a coatrack. Paprika! I've got it! A skylight. Jack, we have already gone over this. You cannot put a skylight on the ninth floor of a 12-story building. Karen, I can't work like this! You can't work like this? You know, I'm the one Oh! God! Honey, look. She left her datebook. - Let's look through it. - And change things. What is this? It's a letter from her therapist. I feel bad reading it. I know. It's terrible. Move your hand. I can't see. "Personality disorder." "Job-related stress." "Prone to aggressive outbursts." She's a psycho! - What are you doing? - Watching the Knicks game. Why? Did they get new cute boy cheerleaders? I'm allowed to watch sports, ok? Cause I'm a guy. That's what guys do. Now get me a beer. Who am I kidding? I want a spritzer. I'll never pull this off. What is happening to you? I told Matt that I'm sports nut that I love watching sports, that I particularly love playing baseball and that I'm really good at it. How quick can you get out of town? What should I do? I mean, do you think I can fake my way through this? I'd say no. Where is my paper? Mr. Zamir. Mr. Zamir! I didn't take your paper. How did you know that's what I was gonna ask you about? Every day, I tell you I didn't take your paper. And every day, you take it. You got me there. I want my paper! Now throw that garbage away. - God, the flies are just everywhere. - Those are not my flies. I always knew Grace was a little But I never knew she was My mother's crazy. That's why I had her committed. Well She's not crazy so much as she just bugged me. She's a bitch. I'm telling you, Karen, I'm worried. I was watching "Justice Files" last night And they said that 90% of assaults are committed by someone you know. Would you? - Maybe. - Me, too. But Grace? I mean, come on. She doesn't even have one personality, let alone six or seven. Give me my frickin' paper, you hairy little thief! You think you're gonna get away with this, but you're not. I'm onto you! You're history! It's over! Oh, God! Get away from me! Guys? What is wrong with you? All right, let me ask you. You said that you wanted mirrored floors. I'm not sure I can make that work. But when I'm doing jumping jacks, I like to look at my Yeah, mirrors-- Mirrors are bad. Bad. I'll just look at my reflection in a steak knife. If I had one, which I don't. There are no knives in here. What's going on? Gee, honey, you look real pretty today. Maybe sometime I could borrow your little kitty shirt? you guys are creeping me out, so I'm just gonna Damn it! Get! Quit! All right, I'm just gonna go and work on my sketches, and then I'm gonna There's my datebook. I thought that Will took it to work with him. I was gonna kill him. But you have it now, so no one has to die, right? I love it. That's perfect. Act crazy, they'll let you decorate any way you want. You know, it's so diabolical, you know, which makes everything better. You know the question is what kind of crazy should you be? You know, you could You could be like Barbra Streisand in Nuts. But No Crazy people never have French tips or $600 highlights. Or Sybil was very effective. You know, "The people. The people. The people." But I think you want to be more like Francis. Hit the freakin' ball, you damn sissy! Excuse me, Grace, that's not exactly helpful. You know, in fact, I think I've improved quite a bit today. No, you haven't. You suck! Your bat hasn't even connected with the ball once! Yeah, but since you told me not to stand on the plate, the ball hasn't hit me once. If you want to make Matt think you're some kind of ball player you gotta focus, be tough, attack the ball. Here, let me show you. Come on. Weight on the back leg Feet shoulder-width apart Elbow up Eye on the ball I think I got it. Let me try now. No, trust me. You don't have it yet. Why don't you run off and get me a little corn dog and some nachos. See that? A blister from the batting cage. You're looking at my very first sports injury. Not counting the time that I got a groin pull reaching for a pair of sneaker clogs at Foot Locker. I am so proud of you. I know you were embarrassed when we had to move to the kiddie area but you felt like a man when the ball hit the clown, didn't you? He went down. I've got to get to Jack's. I've got this bit where I kiss the wall and hum. It freaks them out, and I love it. Do you ever not look gorgeous? God Ten years ago, I would have wasted so much time liking you. Guess what? - You got the Channel 9 job. - I got it! I got the job! - I'm so happy for you! -  I'm a sportscaster, Will. Next week, I'm gonna start doing sideline reporting. I'll be like a Jeremy Schaap or a Sal Palantonio. You know what I like to do when something good happens to me? Something athletic. Like Why don't we go to the batting cages, hit a few? Oh, better idea. Let's play some basketball. Here it is. What do you think? Oh, my God! I've changed my mind. My dream home is no longer Jeannie's bottle. It's this. Here's the check for what I owe you, and just FYI from now on at work, I'm gonna bring a nurse with enough Thorazine to stop a charging elephant, ok? Do you know why I'm laughing? Someone in your head said something funny? 'Cause I tricked you. That letter from my shrink I wrote it To get out of jury duty. And once I knew that you knew I knew that I could use it to get what I wanted. - Oh, aren't you something? - A smarty So you see, I'm not really crazy. Actually, I'm kinda brilliant. Yeah, anything you say, honey. Damn it! Why did I waste all that mace on Rosario? Didn't you hear what I said? I'm not crazy. - It was just an act. - Oh, my God! She's got an ax! Act! It was an act! I am not crazy. I'm not crazy! God! How many That was pretty good. - I was a little rusty at first - But then you warmed up and you just plain sucked. Hey! That's not fair. I beat that one guy. - He was four. - He was seven if he was a day. Why are you doing this? You hated every minute of it. Are you kidding me? I mean, the the balls and the dribbling and the the beautiful hardwood floors. Ok, basketball's not my game. I kind of suspected that when I suggested a game of Horse and you got down on all fours. I knew that sounded too good to be true. You don't have to pretend to like sports for me. Yes, I do. It's why you broke up with your last boyfriend, isn't it? Do you really think I'm that shallow? I broke up with him because he was poor. I'm kidding! I'm kidding. We were just different. I like foreign movies. He liked foreign men. God, I wish you'd told me that sooner. I spent eight hours in the batting cage when I could have been home watching the All-American Cheerleader finals. - Penn State won. Of course they did. They have Gigi Vandecourt and Cami Sewell. So, no more lies? - We'll be honest with each other? - Deal. Head's up. Here comes the kid you beat. Try not to rub it in Thanks for letting me win. You know, I might have won on my own. Yeah, in your dreams. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~

                    			I don't understand this. I mean, what's going on right now? What exactly are we watching? This would be called a basketball game. And where is this all taking place? That's Madison Square Garden. That's a sports auditorium now? It's the world's most famous sports arena. But I can see how that fact may have eluded you given that your entire knowledge of sports consists of giggling every time you hear the word "balls." - Gets me every time. - I know. Oh, sorry I'm late. There was this homeless guy who wanted money, but I thought he's just gonna spend it on booze, so I took him to the Korean market and told him, "Ok, you can get up to, like two pounds of salad," but then I thought, "Who am I to tell him he shouldn't have booze?" So I took him to the liquor store and got him two pounds of malt liquor. - Was that true? - Saks had a shoe sale. See, Grace, not only do your lies have too much detail, they're also socially irresponsible. Look Buckles. Grace, check it out. This is amazing. Tall, muscular lovelies in nothing but short-shorts and matching tank tops. Why would straight guys watch this? If I knew why straight guy did anything, do you think I'd be hanging out with you two homos. - Have you seen Matt yet? - Yeah, he's right there. Right on the sidelines. About four clicks west of Spike Lee. Just right beside that little girl and her grandpa. Uh, that's Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas. - Matt looks good on TV. - Doesn't he? That's my man My squeeze My steady fella. No wonder I was alone for so long. Ring. Hello? What's that? I'm bored? Yeah, thanks for calling. Bye-bye.

You know, and I mean-- Wow! - You were just jumping so high. - I'm the towel boy. Well, you--you look dry. And in spite of tonight's loss, there's still a good chance this team will make the playoffs, providing all the other teams in the league get swallowed by a giant fish. It's Matt Moshea reporting live from the visitors' locker room. Great, thanks. Thanks a lot. - Hey, TV person. - Hey, you. I thought I'd come down to surprise you. Congratulations. You did -- and you looked -- great. I don't care about that. How great? Really great. So what do you think of my office? What's not to like? You're surrounded by naked men with an average shoe size of 17. It'spretty good. - How about a little-- a little dinner? - Mmm, I'd love that. - Hey, Matt! - Harry, hey! What are you doing here? Checking out the naked guys in the locker room. I saw the feed. I wanted to let you know you did ok. Uh, oh, about the fish joke at the end-- - Ha ha! Yeah? - Lose it. - People want to laugh, let 'em watch the weather. - Ok, no fish humor. - I'm Will. - Oh, God. I'm so sorry. - This is Harry Zalen, station manager-- my boss. - Oh. Hi. - Who are you? - I'm, uh, Matt's.. Brother. Will's my brother. Karen, I've had an awakening. There are certain things in this world that desperately need changing, and I am committing every fiber of my being to changing them. As we speak, there is a gun-control rally going on in Times Square, and I say let's join our brothers and sisters in fighting the good fight. - Nah. - All right. Let's go to lunch. Can't, honey. I'm busy. What you doing? Oh, just doing a little last-minute shopping for the step-kiddies. Honey Do you think Mason will like this? I don't know. Does he need steak knives? Oh, honey, if you'd ever seen him work his way through a porterhouse, you wouldn't be asking that question. So what's the gift for, anyway? What do you mean, Jack? Christmas? Hello?! Deck the halls with boughs of money, fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la Karen, Christmas was months ago. Don't you remember? That was the day you let Rosario call her kids. God, I mean, when's the last time you checked your calendar? Well, I don't need a calendar. When my pills run out, I just go back to Pharmacist. - But did I miss anything good? - No, not too much. New Year's Martin Luther King Day "Pick Stan up from the hospital." Oh, that's where he is. And that brings us back to today. Oh! Kare! The Black-and-White Ball's this weekend. Balls. Is it time for that again already? Oh, I hate these formal affairs, honey. Everybody's gonna be there. Mr. And Mrs. Marlo Thomas, Mr. And Mrs. Connie Chung, Mr. And Mrs. Hilary Clinton. Looks like you're gonna have to call out the big guns. Yeah. Bang! Bang! You're supposed to let me blow. Ok, honey. Get ready. Bang! Bang! Ooh, listen. How about you come with me tomorrow morning to the safe deposit box and help me pick out my jewels, ok? I'll bring the truffles and the chardonnay, and you bring that tight little butt of yours! I love it! Ok, Karen, we've got a crazy work day ahead. I've got back-to-back clients coming in, an installation at 2:00, and there's a ton of Xeroxing and faxing that has to happen, so in order to get any of that done I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. You're the boss. I am so upset right now, I--I can't even speak! Yeah, well, if I had those crazy little chicken arms, I'd be-- Look out! She's gonna blow! I'm sorry. I can't have lunch today. You know, I'm walking over here, and with every step, I'm getting madder and madder. I mean, he called me his brother! I know. I told you last night. Break up with him. Lying like that right in front of me! And see, I swear, it's--it's the second most humiliating thing that's ever happened to me in a locker room. - You should break up with him. - And what does he expect me to do, go back in the closet?! Hey, it's a little late. I just bought my first pair of man-clogs, ok? - You should break up with him. - I--I don't know what to do! - Break up with him. - Actually, you know what? I-I'm breaking up with him. How about that?! You got man-clogs? So tell me what happened with Matt. You won't believe it. He asked me to try and understand. Ugh! I hate it when men ask you to understand. Why don't they just be honest and tell you to shut up? Then he went on and on about how he works in sports, and he's on the air now, so he can't be as open as he'd like to be. What a load! All right, what did we say to him? I just said, "Hey, I'm an out and proud gay man. I'm not about to go back in the closet for the sake of a relationship." Oh, that is so good! That is so right! We're here. We're queer, and he better get used to it! As far as I'm concerned it's over, and there's nothing he could say to change my mind. I hope he cried. What did he say? He said he likes me. Oh, that pig! What kind of idiot does he take us for?! It's open! Hey, Will, sorry I'm early. Hey, Grace. I got a cab downstairs. We should get going. Did I mention that he said he likes me? Honey, put my necklaces away. You have your own jewels to play with. Thank you! And I promise As this year's Miss Pregnant Teen America To represent all pregnant teens Whether they be man, woman, black or white. Thank you so much! Knock it off, Miss Fire Island. I'm reminiscing. Look at all of these. Stan has been so good to me, honey. Oh, and all of the sweet memories they bring back. Hmm. On my knees in Belize. Oh! On my back in Iraq. Oh! Oh! And then there was that time in Nantucket! Good times. Well, good jewels, anyway. Oh, look, Kare. Stan's will. Do you have a will? Honey, why do I need a will? I'm gonna live forever. That is the deal, isn't it, Red? Wait a minute. I haven't seen that version. You gonna open it? That is a private legal document. That would be a betrayal of everything that's sacred in our marriage. - Can I open it? - That'll work. - There. - Give me that. Come on, Come on. Let's just see where everything's going. Ooh. Stan's mother isn't getting anything. She's gonna hate that. "And a third of my money goes to charity." - Charities?! - "Girl's Club of Greater New York" Women's shelters Sally Struthers Public television?! What is this crap?! Looks like Stan's got a big heart to go with his enlarged prostate. Oh, balls! Stan pays deaf immigrants He is a misanthropic money whore. That's why I love him. No! No, no, no, no, no. This is not his handiwork. This is the work of our limp-wristed lawyer, Will Truman! Morning. Any of that Chinese food left? I only had two bites when I found a hair in the mushu. So I called the restaurant and they said, "Well, how do we know it's not your hair?" And I said, "Well, I know how my hair tastes." It made me sound crazy, so I hung up. Anyway, I was so disgusted, I threw it all out. - You ate all of it, didn't you? - Yes, I did. And I over-soyed, and now I'm swollen. You gonna ask me about last night? Ok. Fine. Good. You know, 'cause I certainly don't owe you any explanation about my relationship with Matt. - Nope, you don't. - Oh, would you stop hounding me?! Look, he thinks I'm handsome. He thinks I'm smart. He thinks I'm funny. He's basically everything I'm looking for in a man. Not to mention the fact that we wear the same size, so I'm basically doubling my wardrobe. I just don't understand how you could be in a relationship where you can't be you. Yeah, well, being me hasn't gotten me a whole lot of action lately. Or maybe you haven't been following my story line on "No Sex in the City." What do you want from me? All I'm asking for is a little support. Will, what you are doing is wildly hypocritical and against everything you believe in. You deserve so much better. But, hey if you want my support, you've got it. - I want your support. - You don't got it. - Mornin, kittles! - Jack, back me up on this. You know Will's boyfriend? Ever since he got this on-air job, he's gone back in the closet, and Will wants to go on dating him. Thank you! I know the perfect place to take him. - What?! - Yeah, there's this fish restaurant in Queens. It's where all the gay guys take their closet boyfriends. You know, it's like a casual, sawdust-on-the-floor, hand-down-my-pants kind of place. - Jack, he introduced Will as his brother. - Grace, just have dinner with us. Ok? I mean, Matt's a good guy, and I know you'd like him if you just got to know him. - Absolutely not. - They make those killer deep-fried onion blossoms. One dinner. - What did you order? - I just told the chef to surprise me. Think that was a mistake in a place that's located next to a pet hospital? Grace, hi. You gonna-- Grace? Hang on. What-- What are you doing? You gonna join us? No. I thought about it, and I cannot, in good conscience, have dinner with you two. - I-I'm not gonna be a party to your lie. - So, what, you're just here to judge me? Will, believe it or not, I have better things to do with my life. I'm here for the onion blossom. So don't worry. As soon as they call number 39, I'm out of here. - Number 38! - Yes! I'm starving. Number 40! - I'm going back to my date. - Good. Don't want to keep your brother waiting. Might give you a wedgie. - Isn't Grace gonna join us? - Uh, no, we had a bit A fight back at home. - It's a long story. - What's the short version? We fought at home. Ok. Fair enough. So, I've never been here before. Interesting choice. - Great, isn't it? - Yeah. How'd you find it? Jack told me about it. Said it was the perfect place for-- For a guy like you. - Presbyterian? - Exactly. Hey, what are you doing on the weekend? 'Cause I was thinking, you know, we could, uh-- We could-- uh - We could what? - We could drive to the coast. There's this great little bed and-- Would you just Hold on for one sec. - Would you cut it out! - What? You're looking at me all disapproving, rolling your eyes. I was debating whether or not I should add clam strips to my order. You were not! I know that look. It's the same look you give me when I do a British accent. - I never.. - Oh, don't you love? Aha, there it is! Look, if you are feeling guilty because you're compromising everything you believe in, that's your thing. Don't put that on me. I'm just standing here thinking about clam strips, which is moot, because they're all out Out and proud. - Number 39? - Yes! Just Stop looking at me. I'm sorry. That won't happen again. Nothing is going to keep us from enjoying our evening. Hey, Matt! Harry, hey, what are you doing here? Bringing some dinner home for my wife. She loves this place. Her hairdresser recommended it. - Why don't you join us, Harry? - Don't mind if I do. - Will, Matt's brother, right? - That's right. That's me. - So, Will, you a big jock like Matt? - Oh, yeah. Hell, I'm wearing a cup right now. - Damn, Matt, I spent some time defending you today. - Oh, really? Why? Couple of guys at your old job said there's rumor going around That you might be gay. Me? Gay? Me, gay? - Did you hear that, Will? - Yeah. You gay. - So are you? - Oh, please, no. Harry, you don't have to worry about me. I mean I mean, just the idea of two guys together it just I mean, just the idea of two guys together it just just Creeps me out, you know? I think two guys together is hot. W-what? Matt, there's something I have to tell you. I'm gay. Mom is gonna freak. You don't seem gay. Well, that's probably because my party dress is at the cleaners. But make no mistake about it, Harry. I am a gay man. I sleep with men. I have no desire to sleep with women Not now, not ever. You screwed me, Will Truman! What? Oh, don't you play dumb with me. Oh, you stuck it to me but good. - Karen.. - And he is just so comfortable giving it away, aren't ya? Wow. Single mothers. Homeless women. Sally Struthers?! You make me sick! I got news for you people, I'm gonna get him in a room, and I am gonna work that little will until I'm satisfied. Goodbye. Grace, that blouse hurts like a hangover. You know what? Maybe this isn't the best time to talk about this. Maybe it isn't, but I've got to say this. I can't go on lying. I know I said that I would, and I'm sorry, but I can't. The only way I know how to be in a relationship with you brother is if we are open and honest. Those are the terms. Can you accept that? I wish I could but I can't. - Well, then I can't, either. - Good for you! Who the hell are you? Just a single woman in a fish place, applauding a courageous man. Come on, Grace. Let's go home. Oh, but my onion-- Matt, I-- I know how hard this must be for you. A gay guy in your own family. I can't imagine what you're feeling right now. - Matt? - Jack? - Justin? - Dad? Number 39! Coming through. Coming through. Grace, you've been whittling away at that onion blossom for three hours now. Say good-bye. But I just discovered they're good with sugar. Ok. Don't! No, no, no, no. Thank you Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			Ignore it. We're screening. Here's the story of a lovely lady. That's me Who was living with a very lovely girl. That's me! Leave a message. I hate us so hard right now. New rule. No more making phone machine messages after a pitcher of "margateenies." Mail's here, and he is hot! We also got some letters. An advertisement for teeth bleaching Oh, this must be yours. And for moi A postcard from Mama. She's still on that cruise? Yep. Sailin' the Caribbean with boatload of desperate, saggy singles. I gave her the toll-free number. Oh, my God. Listen to this. I don't need my teeth bleached. They're fine. Excuse me. Girl, interrupted. "Jack, I know this may come as a shock to you but your father is a black boy. Gotta run. It's coconut shrimp night. Kisses, Mommy." She said your father's a black boy? And they have an entire night dedicated to coconut shrimp? What is that toll-free number? Oh my God I'm black. I'm black, and my mother says "black boy." I'm black, and my mother's a racist. Actually, Grace, I totally see it. What? Jack's black. I don't know why I have never noticed this before. I salute you, my proud, black brother. Thank you, Will. It's nice to have your support. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go find out what it means to be black like me. Oh, man They're raising the rent on my storage space again? Don't start. I don't get it. Throwing away good money to store a car you never even use. It's my Uncle Jerry's car. Uncle Jerry is dead. For four years now, Uncle Jerry has been dead. And that car is the only thing I have to remember him by. - It has sentimental value. - It's a Chevy Citation With no A/C and old man stink. It's family. You wouldn't understand that, because you're tiny-hearted. Did you just call me Tonya Harding? Don't flatter yourself. You've got a weird thing about family. Everyone thinks so. Lose the car. You never use it. What if we did use it? We could zip off to the Hamptons whenever we wanted to. Wouldn't that be fun? Here we go. That's weird. What do you think's wrong? She just asked a fairy an engine question. Oh, my God. We're all gonna die in this car. Karen, you're not gonna die. It'd take a silver bullet and a wooden stake to do that. Come on. Let's look. All right, but you pop the hood. I just got a mani. You know, honey, I'm happy for you And I'm happy for me, I've always wanted a black friend. I finally found my roots, Kar. It's like my whole life, I've been waiting to exhale. I wish they would hurry up. I've got to get home for a playdate. That pasty, pretentious eunuch Beverley Leslie is coming over to play pool. So, cancel. Honey, no! He's my dearest friend. I thought I was your dearest friend. He's my dearest white friend. I think that fixed it. What did you guys do? I opened the hood and jiggled the bendy thing. I scratched my head and readjusted myself. You know, uncle Jerry used to take me to ballet class in this very car. Then, after, we'd go to Friendly's for a fribble and a fish-a-ma-jig, and I think there's something wrong with your car. What are you talking about? It's purring like a kitten. Yeah. A kitten who smokes God, this is like a Cheech and Chong movie. Dear I can't seem to set up this shot. My big, new diamond ring keeps throwing off my balance. Good for you, Bev. That must have cost your wife a pretty penny. You wouldn't believe the disgusting sexual perversions I had to perform to get that. Oh, I think I would. Meet the twins. Yes, ma'am! Lord, the things we do for love. And money. - Here you go. - Where the hell have you been? Riding a llama in Neverland. Where do you think I was? I was cleaning. Mr. Beverley Leslie, here's your B-52 with one ice cube. Thank you, sweetie. I thought your drink was a blackberry julep with a baby aspirin chaser. I switched. Wait a minute. How do you know that? - Because - Come on, come on Because I'm good at my job. Quit busting my hump, lady. What? Nothing, honey. I was just lookin' at your balls. You're stripes, right? Here we go. Here's all the stuff from inside the car, and here's your $350. Did you find a good home for him? Yeah, honey, I did. I sold him to a family with a farm. There's lots of room for him to roam and lots of other cars for him to play with. Poor Uncle Jerry. You work hard, you live a good life, and this is all it comes down to. You will not believe the day I've had! Something must be done. Look, it's Notorious F.A.G. I just stood in the freezing cold for 40 minutes, trying to get a cab. I finally had to walk halfway across town. Why couldn't you get a cab? Why do you think? Because I'm black. Maybe you should go down to Boy Bar and try and get a little affirmative action. You guys better climb out of your ivory tower and smell the coffee because it's here, it's hot, and it's black! That was kind worth it. Oh, my gosh. Where - Where did this come from? - That was in the tape deck. It says, "For Grace." How could I have never found this? -  Hello, Mini.  - Oh, my God! That's what he called me Mini. Hi, Uncle Jerry. Mini, you know how much you mean to me.  You're my family, and this Chevy Citation represents my deep, deep affection for you As long as you have this car, I'll always be with you. And you sold my Uncle Jerry for $350. How you must feel! Actually, I sold it for $400, and kept 50 as a finder's fee. Not a time to laugh, though. Well, well, well El pollo's come home to roost. How's Beverley? - Miss Karen, I was just -  Don't insult me with your lies. I know where you were Scrubbing floors for Beverley Leslie. I can smell his generic cleaning products all over you. It's not what you think. Oh, really Is that a new Members Only jacket you're wearing? So, what if it is? A lady likes nice things. I see Tell me Is he good to you? He lets me wear jeans to work. Disgusting! I don't wanna know all the filthy details. - What does he feed you? - Subway. The 12-inch. Oh, how could you? I was your world. Are you really gonna throw all that away for a casual 12-inch sub? You steal from him, too? Oh, my God. It's serious. Oh, my God. It's serious. This isn't a farm! This is Queens. I don't know what happened. Last time I swear, there were cows here. Look, we'll give back the $350 $400, Mr. Finder's fee. Right, and then that'll be the end of it. Here she comes. You sold my Uncle Jerry to a nun? I'm Sister Louise. What can I do you for? I'm Grace Adler. I think it is so wonderful that you're married to God. Me, I'm still looking. Anyway We want to give you your money back. Great! So we can get our car back. It's a family thing. I'm sure you understand. My family sent me to a convent when I was three. Actually, they told me I was going to the zoo. I was all excited. They got me dressed up, gave me a lollipop, I ended up here. All I wanted to do was see the penguins. Ironic, isn't it? What's sex with a man like? - It's good, actually - I've loved it - If you find the right guy - Ever since the first time - It's nothing really - It's no big deal - You just lie there. - You're not really missing anything. Maybe we should get back to the car. I've got your money here and I'm gonna throw in an extra $50 for your trouble. No, thanks. No, I need the car to deliver my cheesecakes. Little business I got going on the side. Well, can't you get another car? I need this car. It's my Uncle Jerry's car. I might have an Uncle Jerry, who knows? I was sent to a convent when I was 3. I thought I was going to the zoo. Have I told you the story? Yeah, you have. ell, then the answer to the car question No. What do you mean, no? I'm talking about my Uncle Jerry here. Talk to the beads. What? I can't believe that you're Listen, listen. I'm really sorry about the whole zoo thing but nobody messes with my family. What do you need with a car anyway? Can't you fly? Well, let's see The Bible does teach the value of charity and helping your fellow man. Yes. It does. But God's no fool. I want $3,000 in traveler's checks. What? Are you kidding? You paid $400. Look, you two work it out, I got to go. "What a Friend We Have in Cheesecake" doesn't run itself. What? No! No, I'm not spending $3,000 on this piece of junk. - Just let it go! - Fine. but I hope that you never have to feel what I'm feeling right now. - Me, too. - And when you do, I hope it hurts. Let me just say goodbye. Bye, Uncle Jerry. I'm sorry. I'll never forget you Bird poop. You came between one of the most sacred relationships there is A woman and her housekeeper. What can I say? She just prefers being around masculine energy. Let's leave your wife out of this. I want you to stay away from Rosario! What Rosario does on her own time is Rosario's business! You do not own her, my dear. She's a person! I know damn well what he is. You don't have to tell me my own maid is a person. Of course she's a person! - I'll play you for her. - All right, you're on. Damn it! I'm really going to enjoy having Rosario around the villa. She even alphabetized my imposter fragrances. Special lady. - She sure is special. - Eightball. Side pocket. I would have made that shot! Tell it to the Marines if you already haven't. I'm up! Eightball. Side pocket. Oops. You scratched, I won. Rosario's mine. The hell she is! Now back off, you Keebler elf. Don't you you take that tone with me, mister! I'm not afraid to hit you, you little cup-size capote. How about that? - Well, bring it on, big cheater! - Maid stealer! Get off me, Tattoo. Get off of me! You bitch! You bitch! I won fair and square. Rosario's mine. Stop it. You won me in a game of pool? - It was her idea - What am I, your prize bull?! It was her idea, Rosario. I called you a person. Shut up, lucky charms! Don't you listen to him. I'm not listening to anyone. I don't want to see either one of you again. - What ya doing? - Cleaning house. You know, this whole car thing made me realize I hold onto stuff way longer that I need to. Your Nancy Drew, Girl Detective membership card? Aren't you going to need that in case something mysterious happens down at Old Man Winsley's place? The creepy caretaker did it. Anyway, I don't need it. Just like I don't need this "remember me always" bracelet I got from what's-her-name. Or this piece of the Berlin Wall I got as a gift with purchase at the Lancôme counter at Bloomingdale's. How about these clown shoes? Those are my ballet slippers from fourth grade. I went from a 4 to an 8 in a month. Anyway, you were right, I just have to let all this stuff go. - Want to put those in there? - What's that? The keys to your Uncle Jerry's car. Oh, my God! I can't Wait - What made you change your mind? - I don't know. I guess I just thought about you kissing that bird poop and It just made me feel a little sick at first then sad and then sick again when I realized that we'd shared a spoon at the yogurt shop later that day. I don't know what to say. I just Wait a minute. You paid You paid $3,000 for that junky car? Well, not exactly but, you know, with a little creative thinking I was able to come up with a solution that's going to work for everybody. Come on. Let's move it! We got a trunk full of cheesecakes to deliver, and they're probably starting to sweat. Hurry up! You promised to get me to the zoo by 4:00. - That's right. -  We're going to the zoo.  We're going to the Who's going to the zoo? I'm going to the zoo. I'm going It's a big day for me. I'm not wearing a bra. Hey, Kare. Hey, poodle. Who's your daddy? You are. I'm devastated. I talked to mother last night, and it turns out I'm not black. Honey, I won't believe it. I mean, look at you. I know. It's true. I'm not black. I'm a Black. She got knocked up by one of the Black boys, an Irish-Catholic family from her hometown. At least you're one step closer to finding your real dad. Don't try to console me. Once you've been black you can never go back. If it makes you feel any better - I'm devastated, too. - It does. I mean, oh, why? My Rosie is gone and she's never coming back! Oh, no! You loved her Didn't you? I don't know. It's more I've grown accustomed to her face. She almost makes the day begin. I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon. Her smiles her frowns Her ups her downs. Is cook making noodle pudding? Miss Karen Rosie - Are you back? - I'm back. Where the hell are my slippers? Have you looked up your ass, you drunken fool?

                    			You know, a baboon has a more subtle mating ritual than you do. Yeah, well, baboons can afford to be subtle. They got those bright red behinds to work with. - Oh, God. - Good lord! Honey How can you drink straight orange juice first thing in the morning? Excuse me. Can you stop hitting on me? I'm sitting with my boyfriend. Oh, I am so sorry. I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression. I wasn't hitting on you. I was hitting on your boyfriend. - You're unbelievable. - I know. Tell him that. And I thought you were crude when you told the waiter that your baloney had a first name. Good morning, ladies. And Karen. - You look fantastic. - I have no extra cash. Your teeth are yellow. Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to have a breath mint, would you? Actually, I do. It's in my purse. Well, pop it! It's not doing you any good in there! How offensive! Honey, it's your breath, not mine. Forgive her She has a heart condition She doesn't have one. I just got off the phone with my dad. He's coming to town on business for a few days. So I thought we could all have dinner Friday night. I'm busy Friday. - How's Friday? - It's good. Grace, keep Sunday and Monday open. - Okey-dokey, artie-chokey. - And never say that again. My dad would really like to meet you. It would mean so much to me if you'd join us. Honey, that is so sweet. No. Works every time. Here's your Taboo card, I've got the Taboo buzzer, let's play Taboo. And Go! - It's a device - Alarm clock! Ironing board! Bull whip! Whipped cream! Celine Dion! Dionne Warwick! Damn it, will you let me give a clue, woman? It's a device which cooks - What? - Can't say "cooks." Cooks is on the Taboo card. It is therefore taboo. Damn it! It's impossible to guess this word without using any of these clues. - You use mine to dry your gym socks. - Microwave! The problem with you, Grace, is you're using only the left side of your brain. Can't you be more like Jack and use neither side? Thank you. Dad! Come on it's our turn! Congratulate me, will ya? I just got off the scale. I lost 7 pounds. Were you using Grace's scale? Then you've actually gained two pounds. Well, if I'm already going down What happened to the last slice of pizza? I thought everyone was done, so I threw it down my throat. Isn't she something? She's better than a garbage disposal. And she doesn't make that awful sound when a fork gets stuck in her. I'll make you something, Dad. No, no, no. It's a hassle. Unless you got a nice semi-soft cheese? What happened to this guy Matt you keep talking about? He sounds like dynamite. Why isn't he here? - I meant to mention that, Dad. We broke up. - I never liked him. - You never met him. - I don't have to meet him. Any guy can't make it work with you, there's something wrong with him. My dad had never said anything that sweet to me. The last time I was home he turned around from his "Kojak" rerun and told me I looked like a hooker in that tube top. That's a good story I found out a year ago my miserable homophobic father is really my miserable homophobic stepfather, and I have no idea who my real dad is. Don't play the distant daddy game with me, girly. I'll kick your ass every time. Now, you know, I'm up on Jack's love life because of his internet mailing list. But what about you, Grace? Anybody new? Anything happening, you know? Well, we've only gone on two dates, but I've been seeing - Frankenstein. - Ian. His name is Ian. That's his last name. His first name is Frankensty. Put 'em together, you got Frankensty-ian. He does not look like Frankenstein. Right, Will? Well, he's very large, he has a square-shaped head Every time I've seen him he's being chased by torch-wielding villagers. God'll get you for that, Walter. Come on, Dad, it's our turn. Let's do that Taboo that we do so well. - Ok, I'm ready. - Okgo. - I give up. - Dad! I'm not in the mood. I'm really not in the mood. You know, I had a day, then I had a situation. I gotta go back to the hotel. Come on, I hardly ever get to see you. Tomorrow Make it Friday. Friday night we'll have dinner, ok? Right now I just I feel like gettin' back to my room, putting my feet up and ordering up that movie where Ashley Judd runs around scared in town. Well, beats going home watching mom run around scared of water stains on the Beidermeyer. Don't be so rough on your mother, ok? - You're right. I'm sorry. - I hate getting harsh with you. That's harsh? Whenever I call home, my father hands the phone to my mother and says "it's the middle disappointment." My mother had anonymous sex With one of 11 brothers now scattered across the country and nine months later I was born. You don't learn, do you? I've got your picture and résumé but I should tell ya, you're not exactly what we're looking for. Any notes? Well, since you asked I'd project more and lose your aversion to being fondled. Deal with it! Broadway's a very hands-on business. What's going on? What's happening? What's with all the man-candy in the hallway? They're actors who answered an ad I placed in Casting Call Weekly. - I'm auditioning. - For what? For fun. Do you mean to tell me you dragged these poor, struggling actors down here and got their hopes up just for your own amusement? I just wanted to get clear on your process. Next! "Elias Page." Paging Elias Page. Paging - I'm Elias. - Yes, you are. Right this way. Let's take a looky see at the old rez-umey. Right there. Whoops. Yes, thank you. Let's see. "Yale Drama A summer with the Royal School of Dramatic Arts." Very nice. "Currently at The Actors Studio." You know what all that fancy studying means to me, Elias? Blippity blah blay blue blah, touch me. - What? - Nothing So, Eli How do you feel about nudity? - I'm against it. - Not yours, mine. The ad said I should have a monologue prepared. Yes, you should. Very nice. Please stand. Now up on the ball your feet, spin around slowly, and flex for us. Very nice, very nice. And scene. - Oh boy! - Somebody's a natural. It says here that you do several different dialects. We're gonna have to measure you. What? You mean, like, for costumes? - Sure. - Whatever. - 32 98 - 73 84 And I think we have a wiener. I mean a winner! - You're the dirty bird! - Dirty bird! You flap your wings Feed me the worm Where the hell did he go? Oh, that is so unprofessional. Who cares? I didn't like him anyway. He was coming off a little gay when he should have been coming on a little gay. Listen We're gonna take a little break. We'll be back at 12:30 when we'll be casting the parts of "Naked Man with Massage Oil" and "Naked Man with Stoli." I love the theater. Take me to the salon. I want to get corn rows and change my name to Mo Derek. I can't, honey. I'm meeting Stanley. We have a standing lunch once a month so I remember what he looks like in the daylight. Hey, Rosie, how ya doing? Quit blabbering. It's only an expression. Go what myself? Well, if I could do that, I wouldn't need Mr. Walker, now would I? Speaking of which, put him on. Well, where the hell is he? We had a lunch date. He never cancels. Did he leave me a number, where I could reach him? Oh, and one other thing So what's your favorite part of the Seussical so far? Probably the look that row of shrunken old people gave you when you sat down in front of them. Well, that'll teach 'em to unwrap butterscotch during the overture. You want anything from the bar? Whatever they got. But nothing to drink. The line for the ladies room goes from here to Whoville. Oh, yeah, like in the play. Not smart. Doesn't need to be. What are you what are you What are you doing here? I love Dr. Seuss. Though my mom used to read that one story to me as "one fish, two fish, goy fish, Jew fish." Listen, with me This is kind of a last-minute kind of thing, you know? - The concierge at the hotel had tickets - Here you go, sweetheart. Thanks. to see a show, you now? I mean, that's the great thing about New York. You know, last year I saw - Death of - George, who is this with you? Tina. a Salesman, with Brian Dennehy. You know, you wouldn't think a guy that powerful - could play Willy Loman and make it work, but - Hi, Tina, I'm Grace. How do you two know each other? Tina's a colleague of mine. That's right we're colleagues. What kind of colleagues are you? Working. We're working colleagues. I catered his company's Christmas party. It must've been some party. It's February. You must be a meticulous cleaner-upper. Well, look we'd better get back to our seats. We gotta catch the second act of - What the hell are we seeing? - Seussical. I love rhyming. I cannot believe what I just saw. Married men having affairs. Is there anything worse? I should go. Oh, congratulations. I'm on my way over. Bye. I've got to go. The Fergusons are pregnant. So I've got to convert their S&M room into a nursery. At least I can keep the jolly jumper and the changing table. Before I go, can I run something by you? Honey, could you give me a minute? I'm kind of in the middle of a project. Cross that off the "to do" list. Well, that's good. Now I don't have to take my work home with me. Although knowing me, I probably will. You know I'm a workaholic. What can I do for ya? All right, how do I say this? If you see a person doing something wrong Something that could hurt another person, do you tell the person what the person was doing or do you protect the person by not telling the person what the person was doing? Oh, honey. Did you get knocked up again? What? No! I was out last night, and I saw someone who is very close to a friend of mine having an affair. I mean, I didn't actually see 'em going at it. Cause you know, that would be creepy, but I saw him on a date with a woman who was obviously his mistress. Really. So, do I tell my friend about it? I mean, do you think they need to know? Absolutely not. Thank you. That's all I needed to hear. Stanley Walker, you cheating piece of old man flap! You're a dead man! Look. Jack in a box. Kar, take me to lunch. I'm in a lobster bisque-y, crème brule-y cruisy-waitery kind of mode. Honey, brace yourself. Stan's having an affair. I don't believe it! It's impossible He's so fat! Grace caught him red-handed. He was by himself? Oh, I should've known. Lately he's been wearing his good toupée and his fancy compression garment. Come on, let's go. I'm gonna catch that rotund Romeo in the act! Shouldn't you lock up? Somebody might steal something. Oh, my God, honey, you're right. That's terrible. Remind me never go get a free chiropractic exam from a guy set up in front of a deli. All he did was adjust my boob. I guess the gloves with no fingers should have tipped me off. What's cookin', good lookin'? Whenever my dad goes to a restaurant he always says the same thing. "God, I can make a meal just from the appetizers." So, that's what I'm making him: a meal of appetizers. Good, good. Mom never lets him eat this stuff at home. Why shouldn't he? - Why not? - He's a great guy. - He is. - He should have a little fun. - He's having an affair. - He's what? I wasn't gonna say anything, but Karen told me not to, so I knew I had to. The other night, when I was at Seussical the Musical I saw your dad with another woman. Wait minute, wait a minute. You went to Seussical the Musical? For once in your life can you skip over the show tunes and listen to what I'm saying? I know all about Tina. It's his colleague. I don't think so. During "Green Eggs and Ham" his hands were here, his hands were there, his hands were almost everywhere. Let it go, ok? She's a colleague. She is not a colleague. Do you grab your colleague's ass when they give you a box of Goobers at intermission? Was it a jumbo box? I'm gonna say this just once. My family is not like your family. There's certain things that we don't talk about So, if my dad says that she's a colleague, that's what she is. So you're just gonna deny the truth to avoid suffering? That is so not Jewish. That's right. Consider this one of the gentiles' three gifts to the world. One: we make a great martini. Two: we keep retail stores alive. End three: we don't talk about things that we don't want to know about. - So, you admit there's a problem. - No, I don't. See how that works? See, your problem is you're too suspicious. You know, I mean, for one thing if my dad was in town to see his girlfriend why would he be spending his last night with us? - Hi, I can't stay. - What? This business thing just came up and sort of ballooned into Give me a hug. I gotta run. Well, no, Dad, I just made dinner. I got won tons and crab cakes and chicken drumettes. God, I could make a whole meal out of that. - Tina, what are you doing here? - I'm sorry, I gotta pee. I couldn't wait. It was all that champagne in the limo. It goes right through her.

                    			 Last time on Will and Grace I was out last night, and I saw someone who is very close to a friend of mine having an affair. I saw him on a date with a woman who was obviously his mistress. Stanley Walker, you cheating piece of old man flap! What happened to this guy Matt you keep talking about? He sounds like dynamite. Why isn't he here? - I meant to mention that, Dad. We broke up. - I never liked him. - You never met him. - I don't have to meet him.

"God, I can make a meal just from the appetizers." So, that's what I'm making him: a meal of appetizers. Good, good. Mom never lets him eat this stuff at home.

God, I could make a whole meal out of that. - What are you doing here? - I'm sorry, I gotta pee. I couldn't wait. It was all that champagne in the limo. Bathroom? It's the room on the right. The one with the toilet in it. That makes sense. Oh, I'm sorry, my turn. I'm gonna call the restaurant and tell 'em we'll be a little late. I'll be right back. Oh, Will, what you must be feeling. We're just talking about it, and then there it is! "There it is?" What am I supposed to say? "Who let the dogs out?" She's a colleague. Ohcomeon. I mean, it's one thing when it's just this abstract notion floating out in the universe, but it's another thing when it's peeing in your toilet. Let it go this is not a problem. Do you really expect me to believe that you're ok with this? I do. In fact, I'll show you how ok I am. I'm gonna invite them both to dinner. Oh, right. Yeah, the four of us are gonna eat together. That's a dysfunctional dinner I'd like to see. Crab cakes are dynamite. And what do you think of the chicken drumettes, Pop? You know, I used a little marmalade the glaze. I call the recipe "Chicken Lady Marmalade." You know, one of these days, I'm gonna have to figure out the difference between marmalade and jam. Maybe I could find it online. You know, there's something we haven't talked about I'm really kind of surprised nobody's ever brought it up. Oh, finally. Is this not the coldest winter we have ever had? Any sign of the chubby cheater? No. He's been in that podiatrist office for, like, two hours. Getting his hammer toes fixed up nice and shiny for his new slut! That garbage man is hot. Grind that garbage, trash man. Yeah, you're so dirty Over there, honey. Over there. Stan's in his car. He's probably heading off to his love nest. Drive, drive! - Your skin looks good, Jack. - I've been washing my makeup off before I go to bed. Where is he going? He's going at that hore house. That's not a hore house. That's Burger King. What? Stop the car! What happened? What's going on? What is he doing? He's going straight to the window. What? Did he call the order in? No, they know his car. When they see him coming, they grab five whoppers, a couple of pies throw them to the window and try not to get the fingers near his mouth. Not this time It looks like they're handing him a. a salad. That's all the proof I need. First he gets his toes in shape Now he's eating sensitive . My god, has the men no shame? I know what you're going through. I once found out Marco planned on cheating on me with someone he met threw a personal ad. - How did ou catch him? - It was my ad. I could have screamed and yelled but instead I took the high road and had an affair with my very own but my point is Don't get mad. Get a new rich husband Exactly Drive! I just can't get used to the cold. - I mean, I'm an Arizona girl. - Tempe? About 110 in the summer. Me, I don't mind the cold. I never have. Too cold is Is not good. I like it just, you know cold enough. You know, you get a sweater, you get a hot drink. You know what I'm talking about? No, I don't mind the cold. - But I also like it hot. - Some like it hot. Get it? So, Grace What do you like? What Are we really still talking about the weather? Tina, come on. I want to show you their view. They've got a hell of a balcony. Not so much a balcony as a dead plant museum. We'll bring a t-shirt from the gift shop. My - God! - What? What the hell was that? I know. Next time I'm gonna label the whipped peas. Everybody always thinks it's guacamole, and then it's just a letdown. That dinner was unbelievable! The level of denial You people should be studied! - Give me a break. - No! I am serious! I feel like a Jewish Jane Goodall, and you're "goyim in the mist!" Aren't you upset by this? He's not even my dad, and I'm upset by this. Why don't you call him on this? Why? I'll tell you why! Because I'm not gonna be the one to drop a bomb like this on my family! I did it once before one Christmas, and it ripped us apart! When you told your mother you hated her fruitcake? No! When I told my mother I was a fruitcake! Will, that is totally different. What you were doing wasn't wrong. Look, it just doesn't matter! Let someone else confront him on this. In the meantime, we're not gonna talk about this, and that includes you. But I You I It's a little chile con carne out there, you guys. - It's cold, actually. - Not too cold to snow. You know, the other day it was too cold to snow, the proof? It didn't snow. Remember that, Grace? Yeah. I remember. We thought it was gonna snow But it didn't. But it'sit's never too hot to rain. I remember this one summer day The weather was perfect. Or at least we thought it was perfect. But then this hot front came in from the west. This hot skinny front And it made it rain. And we couldn't ride our bicycles And nothing was ever good ever again! That really is bad weather! I'm so confused! I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone. And all the other people are pigs And I'm the pretty one, but everyone thinks I'm ugly because they're all pigs and they think pigs are pretty! I like the one with Burgess Meredith when he broke his glasses. He was The Penguin, too. And you know where penguins live, it's really cold. I cannot do this anymore! I am sorry! There is a problem in this room that nobody's talking about! I'll say it. You've got a boob coming out. I have got to get out of this room Right now. - Sorry, I'd better - No, no. Let me. Sometimes a woman needs to speak to another woman. And besides, I need a cigarette. Well. I don't know what to say. I'm disappointed in you, Will. You're disappointed in me? Tina shows up here, and I think, "My God, this is my worst nightmare. This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me." Why don't I just handle my mid-life crisis with hair plugs and a Ferrari like any other normal person? - You bought the Ferrari. - How do you think I met Tina? Instead, you invite us to sit down here and have dinner, and I think, "Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe this is good. Maybe somebody will finally drag this out in the open." Instead, what do we do? We sit down, we talk about the difference between a tsunami and a monsoon like a bunch of Micronesian hut people! Say what's on your mind! Come on Dad! We're Trumans. We don't do that, remember? We don't, but you do. You're the brave one. Look at your life! You came out. You told the truth. I rely on you to say what's what! I know you're having an affair. And I think it sucks! Good. Good. This is good. But you're my dad, you know? You're my hero! And you keep doing this stuff and expecting me to look the other way and I can't keep doing it! I need this, you see? I need this. Come on! And it hurts me. And it makes me angry, and I can't pretend it doesn't. You shouldn't! You shouldn't! Don't! I need to say this. - You do! You do! - And you need to hear this! - I do. - And so does mom. Let's take it easy. I'll I'll talk to mom. Good. Well, we're I will be in a 100% honest. There is one more thing I've got to tell you. It was the worst guacamole I've ever eaten. What are you looking at, Driver? Keep you eyes on you own coktail. Here it is Your new husband catalog. - A.k.a - "Hot Jocks". Oh my dog, it's so embarrassing. It's totally my husband catalog. The 400 richest people in America Let's find you something a husband. Oh my god Yes. Bernard Hellman. Oh yeah. Bernie is our men. Karen Delaney Saint Croix Poppy Walker Hellman. It's gonna ring good. God Driver! Get us to the Santon Place and step on it. Step on it. Yes mister In just a few short minutes, I'll be on my way to to be What the hell am I doing? Hello Mrs McFarland Jack, I can't do this. Stan is everything to me I've go to take the moral high ball - Don't you mean the high ground? - It'll come right after the high ball. Just because Stan is having an affair it doesn't mean that I should get rid of him. But I'm not gonna take this lying down. So let's go find the woman who is. Jesus Christ. I don't know why I fell for him, Grace. Because all the good ones are married or gay. And you got the gay one. Would you mind putting that down. It's really bothering me. I'm sorry It's such a disgusting habits. That's why I paid 2 ground to a hypnotist in Boston to help me quit. Money well spent. I don't know why I took this all so personally. I guess it's because I've always thought George is the perfect dad My dad has always been so emotionally unavailable. He once missed my field hockey finals because Rosey Grier was signing autographs at the local Ford dealership. My dad went to prison when I was four. The only contact we've ever had is through a sheet of bulletproof glass. I never win this game. There you are. You played it pretty cool the other day but I wanna know who he's having the affair with, and I wanna know right now! Well, that would be her. I'm Tina. Don't give me the How dare you come between a man and his wife! What you're doing is morally wrong! I have kids with that man! His ex-wife's body is ruined as a result! But he's all I've got. You think that you're coming between me and Stanley Walker, you're not gonna get him without a fight. That's right, lady, put 'em up! Who's Stanley Walker? She's having an affair with Will's dad. Good for you, honey! He's a good catch, keep up the good work, you got a nice ass! Hey Mister Men Never looked better. Well Maybe once but I doubt it. Karen, you're back. I've been worried sick. Did you find anything else? The best news ever! I heard shewing. I'm so relieved. It was all a mistake. Grace told Will's dad was having an affair. Wait Stan was having an affair with Will's dad? It's two men but I'm strangely astonished No fruit of the loon They saw Will's dad with another women Stan's clean, isn't it great? Wait a minute If Will's dad was having the affair then why was Stan getting his toes polished in eating salad? Oh my god, you're right. That adultery bastard. He has been making some other woman uncomfortable for three minutes. Three minutes? That vitamine has been working. I'll kill him! Lady, your dumber than the lint I cleaned out of your trap. What are you doing, talking? I thought I had your job wired shut. I'm gonna put biz in your pillow tonight. You know, all these stuff Mr Stan is doing for you getting more cleaned up and skinny He was worried that he disgusted you in bed. How did he get an idea like that? Maybe from that certified letter you send him? Don't aske me why but the man loves you. In fact, he's upstairs right now waiting for you. My Stanley loves me There is no one else, I'm the only one. That's right. I'm so lucky. My little sugar cube is up there waiting for me right now. Ready to spend me like the pilar on the Black Cook. Come on, Jack. Let's get out of here. Lady! All right. You can come too. You know, you were incredibly inappropriate tonight. I asked you to stay away from my family's buisiness and you stuck your nose in it anyway. You acted like a total loon in the process. I know. - Thanks, I owe you a big time. - I know. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			I'm kinda in a playful mood. Let's go to the batting cages tonight. As much as I'd love to play a rousing game of "guess who's wearing a cup," I can't. I'm busy. I gotta break it off with Paul. You two are still dating each other? God, you both have such bad taste. He's so needy and desperate He's always telling me how gorgeous I am. Just brought up a little Eggo there. Last night, at the restaurant, he tried to say "I love you" in sign language. The candle caught his sleeve on fire. I had to throw my margarita on him. - To put out the fire. - No, 'cause he said "I love you" in sign language. So why are you still going out with him anyway? He a chubby chaser? I'm almost embarrassed to say. It's so ridiculous. He has this amazing dog. His dog I got ya I stayed with many a guy because he had a nice, big dog. - It's so well trained. - I'm sure it is. - Totally kissable. - Aren't they all? - You do realize I'm talking about an actual dog, don't you? - I do now. - Good morning. - Morning. Really, I'm not going to ask you again. Stay out of my underwear drawer. Nothing fits me anymore. How did Paul handle the big shove-off? I couldn't do it. The dog gave me that look and then he started wagging his little tail. You are such a sucker for a little tail. I just wish there was some way I could keep the dog and lose the guy. Don't say that. It's bad karma. I mean, I know you love to play with his dog and pet it - and talk baby-talk to it - Wait, wait. Let me stop you before you embarrass yourself, ok? He's talking about an actual dog, stupid. Very good. I'll make sure that she gets the message. Is it me, or are you hot in here? Oh, God, I hate myself No, that's all right. I thought it was very sweet. Thanks. No, really, who the hell are you? Sorry about that! There were no towels in the ladies room, so I had to wait till someone came in with a long coat. So I see you two have met. Actually, yes So, listen, Summy Stan and I Will pick you up around 7:00 and we'll head on over to Le Chardonnay They have a lamb shank that Stan likes. Although we could probably pour some cream sauce over a boot, and he'd be happy. All right. See you then. Grace, it was really nice meeting you. It was nice You, too. That man is so good-looking, he put a hitch in my giddy-up. - How do you know him? - Oh, he's my nephew. Your nephew? You're an aunt? You know, I do have a family. I know. I just always imagined they lived in pods somewhere in your boiler room And they only came out at night to race from village to village stealing people's essences. Oh, honey I don't have a boiler room. Wherever that nephew came from, I want him to come back. We really had some heat. We clicked. We sparked. You know what the best part is? The best part is that I know that this one is not gay. Please tell me that I'm right. - Yes, you are. - He's not gay. You see? You see all those years of dating losers and closeted gay guys and that drag queen and that one masculine-looking girl is not for nothing. I have honed my instincts. And my instincts are telling me that - your nephew is one quality prospect. - He's married. Really? He seems gay. Hi, Paul. - You look gorgeous. - Paul you don't have to keep saying, "you look gorgeous, you look gorgeous." All right. Hello, sexy. Gorgeous is fine. We need to talk and Hewwo, face! How is my little Pepper? Oh, I missed you so much. Yes, I did. Anyway, the reason I came over here was to Did somebody have a bath? Because somebody smells dericious! Yes, it's you. It's you. I took a bath, too. But I'm already sweating. I'm nervous because I have this hot supermodel in my apartment. Oh, yeah, right. Back to this. Paul, the reason I came What are you doing? Are you trying to use me? - Is that what you want me to do? - You're so good with him. You guys really have a connection. - Yeah, Paul, what I'm trying to say - Wait. I just had a great idea. You know how I'm going to that medical supply convention this weekend? Great! I mean, ohh. I mean Go on. I was going to board Pepper, but now I'm thinking why don't you just take him for the weekend? Really? That would be great. So, what is it you want to tell me? Nothing So you want to come home with me? Anyone who wants to come home with me, give me a big kiss. If you're looking for your Aunt Karen, she's not here. She doesn't work on days that end with "day." Actually, no, I came to see you. I thought you might like to have lunch. I'm just-- I'm just going to stop you right there, 'cause I don't I don't date married men. Well At least not once I now they're married. Wait a second. What are you talking about? I'm not married. Yeah. Right. You probably keep your wedding band in your pocket. Well, no, I don't. You want to check? Kinda. Karen totally lied to me. Why would she tell me that you were married What's goin' on here? Sumner I thought we agreed to meet at the hotel. Aunt Karen, why did you tell Grace I was married? You know, there's one little thing you need to know about Grace. She has only a passing acquaintance with the truth but she's just like this with the polyblends. I'm not the liar here. You're the liar. She once gave me a breath mint, and I woke up four days later with my clothes on backwards and a sticker of Baltimore on my forehead. Honey, go on down to the limo. Uncle Stan wants to take you out and buy you a souvenir of Manhattan. How do you feel about 12-story buildings? - But Aunt Karen - Oh, go on, you little pisher! Excuse me, Karen, we're not done with this. Why did you tell me that Sumner was married? He's a con artist, Grace. He meets attractive, single women, charms his way into their lives makes them think they have a future with him, and then, six months later he's gone, and so is their savings. He even went to jail for it once. Oh, my God! That's awful. Are we talking a full six months? No. No, no Mom, can I call you back tomorrow? Well, I'm cooking dinner for somebody. Well, actually, it's not really for him. I'm doing it for his dog. No, mother, an actual dog! Will, where are you? You would not believe what Karen Wow, what smells so good? - This is great! - You just ate that? Yeah! How come you never make this for me? Because it's dog food. Needs a little salt. So what were you yelling about? First, Karen tells me that I can't go out with her nephew because he's married. Lie Then she tells me he's an ex-con. Then he calls me, and I end up asking him whether or not the guys in the joint are as hot as they are "Oz." Are they? I don't know. He's not an ex-con. That was another lie. So I asked him why is Karen doing this? And he says, "It's because she doesn't want me going out with you." She doesn't think I'm good enough for him. - He told you that? - Why else would she stop me from dating him? I mean, can you believe her? How dare she think that I'm not good enough or classy enough for her family. You know, I gotta be honest. That is damn good dog food. Now, I'm gonna track her down and I'm gonna rip her a new Hold on a second. You are sautéing dog food in my best skillet. Yeah, well, mine doesn't heat as evenly. I want you to say that again And listen to yourself very carefully. Mine doesn't heat as evenly. - For the purpose of - Making a farewell dinner. - For - A dog. Ok, I get it. Paul's coming home tonight, and this whole thing is going to be over. - By the way, where is the dog? - Jack took him out for a walk. Why? So you could surprise him with this romantic dinner? And a movie. I'm gonna track down Karen. I'm gonna use those little bottles of airline booze as chum. We're back! We had a delightful time. Anyway, gotta run. Tater tot. Wait! Whoa - Who's this? - That's Pepper. Your lover's dog. His tag said dry clean only, but I washed him in warm. - It wasn't my fault! - Oh, no, you lost the dog? What can I say? We were playing fetch, and when I brought back the stick, he was gone. Pepper is out there alone? This Paul is gonna freak! Relax. He'll get over it. Would you get over it if somebody lost your needlepoint pillow with the "Party of Five" cast? Dear God, what have I done? The important thing is not to panic. We still have plenty of time to figure something out before Paul gets here. - Maybe it's not Paul. - Will, it's Paul! - Maybe it's another Paul. - Paul Budnik. - Maybe he forgot about the dog. - I'm here to pick up the dog. - Maybe he's over you. - I missed you. Well, my work here's done. Hold on there, girly girl! You lost that dog, and you are gonna tell him you lost that dog. Shift it back. If you tell him you lost the dog he's gonna be so angry with you, he'll dump you. You're guilt-free. No muss, no fuss. You are a despicable person. Forget it! You lost the dog. You're gonna tell him so. - Hello, gorgeous. - Paul, I lost your dog. What? - Pepper's gone? - Gone, gone, gone! And it's all my fault. So just Whatever you wanna say to me, whatever you wanna do, let 'er rip, because I deserve it. I want you to hold me till the pain goes away. No, I know you've got a lot of dogs. But this one's special. He answers to the name of Pepper And if you put your nose to his belly, it smells like corn chips. Hello? - Any luck? - No. I looked everywhere. I really tried to put myself in a dog's position. Why should today be any different? This is what I get. I only stayed with Paul because he had that great dog and now the dog is gone I'm stuck with Paul the rest of my life. Grace was right. She said this would come back to bite me in the ass, and it did I don't understand why you just don't break up with him. He'll understand. He's not hot. No. No. I made my bed. Now I'm gonna lie in it. Ssince your next date is the fourth date, you'll be lying in it with Paul. On the other hand Do I really owe him anything? I mean, terrible things happen every day Dogs run away, people get sick. Isn't it worse to continue dating Paul? Doesn't that just compound the offense? You know, I'm thinking about veneers. I'm breaking it off. For his own good. And for my own good. And the good of all Americans. I love being a lawyer. I can convince myself of anything. Paul? Hi, it's Will. Listen, I Good. We're on the same page. Thank you. We're going away for the weekend. Honey, be a love and move that filthy goat pelt off my husband's seat. Thank you. It's nice to see you two. The lazy eye is getting better. Mrs. Walker, you're awful. Oh, Lois, you have no idea. - Ma'am, I'm gonna need to see your ticket. - I don't have a ticket. - Well, then, you can't go in. - Look, it's no problem. Just two minutes. Miss, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to leave. Excuse me. Would you just take your hands off me? It's an opera. How about a little decorum? We need to talk. - How'd you know I was here? - Rosario. I waved a Hostess berry pie in front of her face, and she sang like bird. That's it! Tomorrow she loses a finger. Look, I talked to Sumner. He's not a scam artist, and he's never been in jail. So can you please tell me why you are doing everything possible to What is Stan doing on the floor? He had a turkey in the limo. He's sleeping it off. Oh, come on, it's Madame Butterfly. You know how it ends. Look, I put up with a lot of crap from you Telling me my chest is on backwards That my hair is such a disaster the Red Cross won't give it coffee. What? I never said that. But I might use it. Red Cross! I like it! This is different. This hurts. You tell me the truth. You tell me why I can't see Sumner. All right, you wanna know why? I will tell you! He's a hired assassin. He'd just as soon kill ya as look at ya. - No, he is not. - Ok, he's a woman. - A robot? - Stop it! Stop lying and admit it: You don't think I'm good enough for him. What?! Your thong's on too tight! Then why won't you let him see me? - I have my reasons! - Well, then, tell me! - Just drop it! - Why, because you think I only sleep with homos? If you answer her, maybe she'll leave. - Tell me. - All right. The reason I don't want you to go out with Sumner is because Because he's not good enough for you. What? Honey, you're special, and Sumner He's just not. Now, don't get me wrong. He's my nephew, and I love him like a son of a bitch. And I mean that literally. Stan's sister's a bitch. But, you know, there is just no way that he is going to appreciate what a wonderful woman you are. I mean You're quirky, you're kind. You've got a heart as big as your feet. So come on, let's just drop it and watch the movie. What? Nothing. You just - You think I'm special. - I do not. - You said it. - I take it back. You can't take it back. You already said it, and it's out there, and it's never gonna go away. Well, don't let it go to your head. Your hair's already such a disaster that the Red Cross wouldn't give it coffee! Thanks for going away with me. I just don't think I can stay in the city over the weekend with all these memories of Pepper. I want us to make our own memories, Will. Fantastic. I found this under my couch. Pepper's "Gaily Growl." He loved this. "All the news that's fit to woof." What was that? Mold spores. It'll get better in the country. Let's go. Ok, let's go! Pepper, you're back! You must've climbed up the fire escape and pried open the bedroom window. Oh, my God! How did you get him back? Doggie LoJack. There's a chip in his neck. He's trained to run away. I can't believe it. Do you have any idea the hell I went through trying to find this dog? And now you're telling me you were totally scamming me? Hey, I'm a realist. Pepper gets me a lot of play. He's a hot dog. Enjoy your hot dog 'Cause you'll be gettin' none of mine. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			Last cards. Down and dirty. - Pair of queens starts. - That would be us! That was funny the first 15 times you did it, but now you're just slowing down the game. Sounds like we've got a bitter straight at the table. So tell me, Rob How was the traffic coming over here? Not too bad. You just gave away your hand, my friend. - I'm all in. Oh, you are in trouble. - I call. - Me, too. - Wait a minute. Wait. You don't get it. See, I'm all in, which would indicate that I have an unbeatable hand. - I still call. -  No, see That's just stupid. So I'm gonna give you the opportunity to take your bets back. You don't know this, but you have a "tell" when you're bluffing. - No, I don't. - Yeah, you do. You tell everybody you're not bluffing. - Show 'em. - Heh? Oh-ho yes! I gots the money. Oh, I gots the mo-nay. Damn it, now I have to go back to the ATM machine again. All right, I want you guys to wait. I don't want any pokey goin' on around here! - Be careful! - Hurry back! - I can't play with her anymore. - I want her out! - She makes me violent! - What? Why? She sucks. That's as polite as I can put it. She's obnoxious, she's aggressive, you know, she goes like this when she's thinking Call me old-fashioned, but I think poker is like cooking or gardening. Women should just stay out of it! I admit she's got some annoying habits, but this is Grace! You can't just ask her to leave the game. - No, but you can. - She's your wife. Oh, honey, lemme save you the trouble. Karen, love. It's your voice I heard. I thought someone was strangling an old macaw. Candy! I can't believe you're up and around. I guess even a mad scientist has to hit a wall at some point. So, how they hangin', honey? Well, thanks to Dr. kipper, three inches higher. Listen. As much as I'd love to stay here sweatin' with the oldies I'm getting a little woozy from the booze-y seeping from your enlarged pores. Oh, honey, they're not enlarged. They're just in shock over that hair color. Sweet gal. Hi, Kare. Sorry I'm late. I was getting rolled in the mud by a large Greek man. I didn't know the spa offered that. It doesn't. - Why do I smell plastic burning? - Oh, it's Candy Pruitt. That girl does love her cosmetic surgery. She's gone to Mexico for face-lifts so many times I'll bet if you whacked her head with a stick, prizes would fall out. I mean, honestly Why can't people just be happy the way they are? - Oh, I agree. - I'm thinking of getting some work done myself. Fantastic! what? My shoulders. Oh, honey They're so 1990 and which is really just the forties with coke. I would get some surgery, but I'm practically unapproachable as it is. Honey, look. Come on. It's the latest thing Permanent shoulder implants. This guy, Dr. Donald Dixon has perfected a brand new technique. He uses bunny cartilage. Not really. That's just what I told the kids. Oh, I don't know, Kare, I'd be careful. I once knew this guy who went in for a nose job And couldn't stop, couldn't stop, couldn't stop Came back a woman. You're right. I should see it on someone else first. I need a guinea pig. Oh, Karen. F.Y.I. Sasha in electrolysis just got a power mower So she ought to be able to tackle those legs of yours. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I feel good. Been in a bit of a slump lately, but not anymore. I've got my lucky hat on Finally horked up that thing that's been caught in my throat all day. Why some guy hasn't snapped you up is beyond me. Listen, Grace You ever wonder what it would be like if everybody wanted you out of the poker game? Well This is what it's like. You're out. What? No one can stand playing with you. You're bad You get taco sauce all over the cards And at this point you're down so much, you're paying people in turquoise jewelry. And except for Larry, none of us want it. Where is this coming from? You're telling me this five minutes before they get here? I tried to tell you all week, but I What? I'm afraid of you. Physically. You have oddly powerful upper body strength. - This is so unfair! - Ow! See! See! That's what I'm talking about! You think these little girl hits are cute, but they hurt. Before I met you I could get my arm a lot higher than this. Come on, just give me one more chance. I really want to win my money back. You won't win it back, Grace, because you're bad. Tonight I'm gonna be better. I know it. I've been playing with myself and I feel much more confident. Funny, it just makes me feel sleepy. - Come on. please? - It's not gonna work this time. I promised the guys  ok! if you'll excuse me, I am going to go put on my lucky poker bra. Or at least a bra. Joe gave me this shirt. I hate it. I have been looking forward to this game all week. Finally we get to play a poker game without that annoying - Ready to play, guys? - Onion dip. Well, well. Candy Pruitt, as I live and drink. You know, honey, you've still got your looks. Where are you keeping them? Oh, Karen, love, I just had the most marvelous salt scrub. Good for you. There's a question that I've been meaning to ask you that only you can answer. Is 60 sexy? Of course. Don't you remember? Don't you mind me. I'm just waiting for my very, very favorite shoulder masseur. Good afternoon, ladies. Before you enjoy your facial I will be giving you a little massage. How about if I begin with you, stranger? Perfecto. Oh, my. My, my, my. What is it, doctor? Well, your shoulders! They're so big and broad. Is that good? Well, of course it is. Don't you know it's the year of the shoulder? Big shoulders are in and small shoulders are out, out, out! - Is that true? - Absolutely. Well, nothing for me left to do here, ma'am. It was an honor to touch your giant shoulders. Let me just get rid of these. Are you ready, Miss Pruitt? Yes, please. But I warn you If you begin touching me inappropriately, I may have to increase your tip. Ok, let's begin. Well. That's just - What the hell's going on back there? - Well, I'm sorry. It's just that Seems as if there's no shoulder. You go straight from neck to arm. Why, that's absurd. I have perfectly fine shoulders. Yeah, if you need to rescue children from wells. They might be a tad petite, but it's not as if I have a handicap. No, of course not. Tell me, is it true your other senses are heightened? Oh, my god! What am I going to do? Well, you could have the surgery. - It's experimental - Don't you do it, Candy! Don't you listen to that shoulder expert! God made you in his image, and I'm sure he doesn't regret it that much. I see what you're getting at. You want to keep me a laughingstock And of all times In the year of the shoulder. Damn it, Grace! Again? Don't feel bad. It's a game! You just as easily could have won that hand. I think I need a little air. I seem to have a headache from the apple-cinnamon candleor something! I'm feeling resentful, and it's coursing through me like poison! It's gonna be a fun ride home for me. All right. I gotta go call the sitter. You're doing very well. I know! Isn't it great? I can't believe how good you've gotten Smart bets, calling everybody's bluff. - I just can't imagine how you're doing it. - I'm cheating! - You're cheating? - Yeah! Isn't this great? Cheating is wrong! That's why they call it cheating. What, are you from Florida? I'm telling them. No, no, don't, don't, please! You don't understand. You know the jewelry I lost last week? I really have to get it back. You don't even like turquoise jewelry! No, I don't. But I like what it symbolizes What? Getting all dolled up for a Jimmy Buffett concert? All right, forget it. Forget it. - Forget what? - No, you're joking. Just forget it. Tell me. That jewelry was the last thing given to my grandmother by her best friend Ruth. They came over on the boat together from Russia. Whenever one would get up, the other one would save her seat. They were best friends. My grandmother flew to Chicago to see her, but she was in and out of consciousness. She hadn't spoken for days. When my grandmother was alone with Ruth She leaned in and she whispered "I love you, Ruth. Do you love me?" And Ruth opened her eyes and said "More than I ever imagined I could. Good-bye, my dear friend. I'll save you a seat." We gotta get that jewelry back. Isn't it exciting? Soon they'll be wheeling out a beautiful bouncing new pair of shoulders full of life and promise. It's like childbirth, except without the unpleasant child afterward. I don't want no scrubs, a scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me  hangin' out the passenger Oh, hey, come on, let me try! Gimme that! Gimme that! I love it! I love it! Hi, my name is Karen Walker. How do I sound? How do I sound?! Oh, my god, that voice is ridiculous! Hospitals are fun. Does it seem like this is taking an awfully long time? It has been a while. Once I saw on Dateline that this guy went in for a fungus under his fingernail and he came back with no limbs. Luckily, he was ugly, so it wasn't that sad. Oh, my God, Jack I just got a flash! Something bad has happened to Candace! - How do you know? - Honey, you know I'm a little psychic. Remember when I predicted that Driver was gonna lose his job, and then two days later I fired him? My God, you're right. And that time you predicted that Rosario was gonna fall and then you pushed her down the stairs. You're scaring me, Karen. It's like you have ESPN. What if something bad has happened to Candace? What if she's dead and it's all my fault? Sounds like somebody needs a back rub on her front. Deal's to me. Everyone ante. I'm outta cash. Does anyone know how much this turquoise earring was worth? More than you know, Larry. More than you know. Will, we really don't need to get into that right now. It's such an incredible story. If you guys knew where that jewelry came from Well, I do know. I was with Grace when she bought it off the transvestite dressed as June Carter Cash. What? He was selling it to raise money for his "grand ole opy-ration." Little different from the way I heard it. Grace, can I see you outside? Nope. I'm still playing. Everyone, the game's anaconda. You're gonna take three cards and you're gonna pass them to Will, come on, we're still playing! Well, I'm sure they'll save you a seat! I know you're upset. I should have told you that my grandmother was a transvestite. - You are unbelievable! - What's so unbelievable? I was cheating. Is it such a big leap to lying? Invoking the memory of your dead grandmother? You want to avoid the holdup in purgatory and take the express train to hell? You're upset. I understand. I've been taking your money, too. So I'll tell you what. We get back in there Throw ya a bone. I'm telling them. You do, and I'll tell them you're in on it! - You wouldn't! - Wouldn't I? What haven't I done tonight? Nurse, we were looking for Miss Pruitt. Oh, I'm sorry. She's gone. But don't worry. She's in a much better place now. Oh, my God! she's dead! And for what? Just so I could fill out the new Versace strapless. You know what would go great with that is the Jimmy Choo slingback. Already got 'em. Oh, God, I hate myself! Can the salesgirls at Barney's be right? Am I a bad person? I could answer that. Yes, you are. - You're ok! But I thought - You thought wrong. They had me in this room, but my new shoulders were too broad for the bed. - They are magnificent! - Aren't they? And they're the very last pair. - Whaddaya talkin'? - That's right, sugar. You're gonna have to settle for last year's shoulders. So the joke, it seems is on you. Sorry, guys, I just wanted to get rid of the nacho cheese breath. Cool ranch I bet 50. See your 50 - Raise ya 50. - 100, huh? I'm out. What's it gonna be, Rob? - Biggest pot of the night. You in? - Thinking. - I'm out. - Yesss! How does the song go, Rob? I got the mo-nay, I got the mo-nay. - So what'd you have? - I'm not gonna tell you. - Come on, man. What'd you have? - Forget it. A pair of 3s? What is this? It's called good card playing. You looked at my hand. I wouldn't look at your hand, Rob. I know where it's been. Yeah, you did. You been losing all night. Suddenly it's the biggest pot, and you win? You cheated. Excuse me. I don't cheat! Come on, guys. It's just a friendly poker game. What kinda person's gonna cheat? I don't know, Grace. I've never seen him bluff before. All right. Come on, Will. Let's just have a do-over. A do What is this, Montessori school? - I won this hand! - Yeah, by cheating. I'm taking my chips back. - Those are mine! Let go! - You're not. They're mine! - Gimme my chips! - You want the chips, Rob? Take 'em! What the hell's wrong with you?! Stop it! Stop it! It was me! It's me! I'm the cheater! I could see all your cards, and Will told me to stop but I couldn't, 'cause I have a real problem losing. I'll cheat and I'll lie. I don't know Maybe it's from spending three years wearing a scoliosis brace. That was a lie, too. I am so sorry. And I will never play poker with you guys ever again. Say whatever you want about me. I know I'm horrible. That was great! You were so convincing! Unbelievable! - The table was beautiful. - I don't know I just went with it! We're gonna get going. We'll see you next week. What You What? Grace, you should know better. In this house, a queen beats a straight every time. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			Jack, eat something. Come on. I bought you this yummy lavender cupcake. With rainbow sprinkles The color of our flag. Thanks, guys, but ever since Rocco dumped me, I can't eat a thing. It's like I'm becoming "manorexic." I know. Breakups are hard. Especially after all the time you and Rocco spent together. You know, both days? I'll never get over this. Gosh! Come on! That's not the Jackie I know. You take a lickin', and you keep on tickin' So you can keep on lickin'. Maybe I should eat a little bit of that cupcake. You really shouldn't use food to suppress your pain. Yeah. thanks for bein' so supportive, G. But right now I just kind of wanna be alone with my thought. I should probably help with the check. What sounds better at a party? "I just got back from Bora Bora," or "I just got back from the coast of Australia"? And before you answer, keep in mind that with Australia there's lots of opportunity for puns on the phrase "down under." What are you talking about? Joe and Larry and I are going on a scuba vacation. How fun! Are you gonna take anyone else? Hint, hint. You mean someone who'd spend a 13-hour plane flight going "What's that? What's that noise? What's that?!" Well, you know The sound of 50 packets of nuts being opened at the same time sounds a lot like a wing falling off. I gotta pee like a racehorse. I don't mean a lot. I just mean throwing my mane back and snorting. Oh, my God! I was just thinking about you. - No, you weren't. - No, I wasn't. God, it's been so long. How are you? How's charlie? Oh, you know, I don't know. We kind of drifted apart. He moved to San Francisco a couple years ago met a guy at a Pottery Barn had a glass of chardonnay and poof! Instant couple. What? You guys were best friends. You did everything together. Oh, gosh. I still remember that Halloween when he went as Cindy Crawford and you went as her mole. What happened? Nothing happened. You know, gay man, straight woman. It's not like we had anything holding us together You know, like a house or kids. You must've been through something like that with Will. We're still together. Roommates, havin' fun, doin' stuff. No offense, sweetie, but I know how to keep my gay man. Well, good for you. I guess you and Will are the exception. - I guess. - I have to go. - Definitely call me. - I will. - No, you won't. - No, I won't. Another cupcake. You just missed Heidi Dauro. - No way. - Yeah. You know, she doesn't talk to Charlie anymore. He just up and moved to San Francisco. Well, good for him. Why good for him? I don't know. What did he have keeping him here? - Good-bye. - Wait Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We haven't filled in the crossword puzzles with dirty answers yet. I know, but I want to be early for my scuba class. When I get there late, I get the bad wet suit. You put it on, it makes that "pbbbt" sound, and everybody giggles. Will, come on. Put the stuff down and come sit with me. - What? Say again. - I really need to talk to you. The creature from the hot lagoon. Make it quick. I'm sweaty in places I never even knew existed. The other day I was thinking that You and I have been friends for a long time All right. Enough. I want to talk to you. You know, these things make everything look bigger. Good. You can take it on your next date. I was thinking that you and I should invest in something together. Like what? Your debt? No. Something for the both of us. - Just tell me what you're thinking. - I'm not thinking of anything specific. - Where do you want the piano? - Over there. Any thoughts at all? Of course. The perfect investment. Matching guys in weight belts. Hey. Guys in rubber suits shouldn't throw stones. Thanks, guys. You bought a piano? No. I can't afford a piano. We bought a piano. Before you freak out Really, between the two of us, it's really not that expensive And I think it would be really great for us to own something together. The piano is perfect. In my family, no matter how far away we got from each other or how much we fought the piano always brought us back together again There was one time my family fought and got real far away from each other. We called it the Eighties. I don't know, Kar. I've never felt a pain quite like this. They tell you to stretch before love. I didn't listen But I have found that it helps to throw myself into my writing. You can write? You know I'm a writer. I completed three short novels by the time I was ten. In fact, my first one, "Forbidden Fort From Cushions" received critical acclaim from my nana. - Honey, are you wearing base? - A little bit. So, I've decided to write my relationship with Rocco the way it should have been. I'm turning my pain into art. "To Weep and To Willow, a Harlequeen Romance." - You want me to read you some? - You can read? A little bit. Here it goes. "Christian awoke with a start. There was Giovanni, looming large At least from the side view. His eyes, black as sin and burning with lust. Christian felt his man heat rise within his being. Suddenly, Giovanni seized his mouth, devouring his soul. Their tongues struggled to find each other in a wildly ravishing kiss that ripped through Christian like a bolt of lightning." Cheese and rice, that is so hot! There are places I re member all my life. Though some have change changed changed  Yeah! That is good! I can't believe what a good piano player you've become in just four or five days. I have you to thank for that video, "How to Become a Good Piano Player in Just Four or Five Days." This is so fun. - Gotta go. - What? Where are you going? We got plans. A bunch of us are gonna go see cute guys in their underpants. That's actually the name of the play. What's it about? I don't think we care. So, what? You're just gonna blow me off? Look I didn't say anything Thursday night when you made me skip going to the gym so we could work on our Elton John-Kiki Dee number and I didn't say anything last night when you kept me up till three a.m. learning the Mikado. By the way, do you have any idea how hard it is to get "three little maids from school are we" out of your head? But tonight, I just want to do something else. But the piano will miss you. I will miss you, Will Sometimes you think something's gonna be really cute and then it just turns out kind of creepy? I will see you later. Fine I don't know why we bought this thing if you weren't gonna play it. Grace, what is going Are you ok? Yeah. yeah, I'm fine. It's just a little case of "pianis interruptus." No, I'm fine. I'll see you later. Three little maids from school are we, filled with the br Damn it! "Giovanni's fingers tore wildly at the lacings" "of my seafoam green polar fleece." "Like some fantastic farm animal, he grunted and whispered" "Tonight, my love" "you will see the face of God." "Christian closed his eyes and received him hungrily." Lord, this is hot. Do you know if Joseph Aldi happened to call and say what he thought of my design for the breakfast nook? "He shuddered and screamed out, I am reborn!" I knew the marble countertop would be a big splash. Karen, can I ask you something? Oh, yeah. Give it to me. Will and I bought this piano together and for the first couple of days, it was great, but now - it seems like he's bored with it. - Ooh! ouch! Like last night He just up and walked out in the middle of our sing-along. Filthy beast! Well, that's a little strong. Give it right back to him. You know what? I will. You know, he doesn't understand how important this piano is. That's it! That's the stuff! If you're gonna bring something into your life, you have to invest some time into it. Yes. It's a commitment, and that means both people have to be committed to it - Right? - Yes! I'm not gonna let him just walk away from this. I'm gonna protect what's important in my life. Thanks for your support, Karen. I feel better. Grace, when did you get here? Honey, your words are rocking my world and my pants. Why aren't you typing, you big, merry sissy? I don't need to write anymore. Rocco and I are back together. No, Jack, I need these pages. I'm getting so many images from this stuff sex with Stan has gone from "I've got a headache" to "I've got to have it!" Sorry, Kar, no can do. But, honey, I've got to know what happens next. I'm addicted to these stories which is odd, because I don't have an addictive personality. Even if I wanted to write something, I couldn't, 'cause I'm happy now. Pain was the coal that fueled the choo-choo of my art. What are saying, honey? If you If you weren't with him, I'd have my stories? Probably, but I am with him. - But if you weren't - But I am. - But if you weren't - But I am. - But if you weren't - But I am. Three little maids from Damn it! Listen. About last night. Thanks for understanding. You know, I just needed to be around people. I know. I was just being selfish. Of course you should see your friends. I'm glad you feel that way, 'cause you know I'm going out again tonight. Oh, I know. You gotta have friends, right? - That's right. - Hit it! 'Cause you gotta have friends.  The feeling's oh, so strong. Surprise! Hi, friends, and Mr. Zamir. - What's going on? - What's going on? You don't have to go out because I brought your friends to you for an old-fashioned piano party. It's kind of like an old-fashioned bore except it has the words "piano" and "party" in it. Ladies and gentle-ladies I would like to dedicate a song to my Rocco The love theme from "A Man and a Woman" or as I like to call it, "Two Men." Why did you throw me a piano party when you knew I was going out? 'Cause it's so much more fun. This way you can bring your friends to the old-fashioned piano party, and, really - Will, everyone loves an old-fashioned piano party. - Please stop saying "old-fashioned piano party." There's no such thing as an old-fashioned piano party. Just because you keep saying "old-fashioned piano party" doesn't mean it exists! I have to tell you, this is a great old-fashioned piano party. Even better than the ones my mom used to throw. I'm laughing because I'm uncomfortable, and I don't know why. You know what we need to do? - Our Captain and Tennille number. - No. Not even if I get to be Tennille. What's the matter with you? You're acting like a nutball. My mistake An old-fashioned nutball. Honey, I'm desperate. What's it gonna take to get you to break up with Jack? Well, I really love him, so I guess my kids won't have their "pay off the bully" money tomorrow, but But that's ok, 'cause I'm the bully! Get out of here. Get out.  Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough That's enough! Time for root beer floats. That should get Will into the spirit of the old-fashioned piano party. Count me out, Grace. Joe's been very upset with my love-handles or as he calls them, "I don't want to touch you, Larry." Come on, Larry, let's go. It's margarita madness at Crisco Disco. - That sounds fun. - Larry, you and Will aren't going out, are you? - Fine. I'll go alone. - Everybody! Will really wants to play the piano, but he's a little shy. Maybe you can give him a little help, ok? I don't want to play the stupid piano. Come on, Will. Your wife went through a lot of trouble. Come on. Play. She's not Everybody, root beer floats. Come and get it. Will? No. I'm getting out of here. Where the hell are my keys? What is your problem? Why are you totally bailing out on this piano? I'm not! What, do I have to play it every second? Yes, you do. Now, sit your ass on the bench of the piano that we bought together, sip your root beer float, and have some friggin' fun! - What? - There they are. I was gonna say, "be careful." Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! - Should we go? Look what you did! You ruined it! You ruined everything! We should go. Grace, I'm sorry, but it's just a piano. No, it's not. It's more than that, but you just don't realize it, so just forget it! Just go! Just move to San Francisco and go scuba diving for cute guys in underpants 'cause obviously, there's just nothing keeping you here! Have you been gargling with bong water? We're drifting apart, Will. People do. It happened to Heidi and Charlie. They don't even talk anymore. Oh, my god! Is that what this is all about? Grace, we are always going to be in each other's lives. How do you know that? Things change. You're gonna get a boyfriend. - I'm gonna get a boyfriend. - Hopefully not the same boyfriend. We're not a couple. We're not married. We don't have kids. What do we have to keep us together? Love. - Love will keep us together. - Don't do that. You know, there are a million things that could pull us in a million different directions.  Think of me, babe, whenever.  - And then we'll end up talking less and less. -  Some sweet-talking  guy comes along -  singing a song - Don't do this. We're talking about our friendship here.  Don't mess around. You've just gotta be strong. You know what? Doing this stupid song is not gonna take away my concerns, ok? - Just stop.  - Stop! 'Cause I really love you. - Stop.  - Stop I've been thinking of you. Look in my heart and let love keep us together. Well, I must say, this is the best old-fashioned piano party I've ever been to. And, you know, this thing is going back tomorrow. First thing in the morning. Yeah. Still creepy. There you are. Penny for your thoughts. - I'm dumping you. - What? - It's just not working. - Why? I don't know. Karen didn't tell me why, but it's not. Good night, Jack. Honey, what's going on? What's happening? Are you ok? Karen, Rocco just dumped me. Oh, honey, that's terrible. My heart is cleft in twain. You must be devastated. Here. Why don't you try writing through your pain. When last we left him, Giovanni was staring at the stable boy and feeling a familiar tightening in his pants. Go. I know you made him dump me. What'd you do, pay him 50 bucks? Did he say that? Who are you gonna believe? Me or some street trash I paid 50 bucks to to dump ya? I will never forgive you for this And as for more writing Well, you just forget it. How about if I pay you 100 bucks? You know, that is so low. It hurts that you would try to bribe me. It causes me a lot of pain. I have no choice but to write through that pain. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			Oh, I forgot to tell you. Remember that ultra-hip club, the Atom Bar? I'm not revealing my sources but apparently it is re-opening this Friday. Hello, "Day-Old News?" Yeah, I'd like to cancel Will Truman's subscription. Yeah. he's going to be giving his business to "Behind the Times." Ok. Ok, ok. Ok. I love you, too. You knew Why wouldn't you tell me? Because you know how you are at these things. You stand in a corner, pretending to be waiting for somebody. "Where is my fake person? I told my fake person to be here at 9:00 sharp. You never have any fun. Come on, you're just like a little willflower. You're right. But that was the me of the past. The me of the future is totally different. Yeah? How? I'm gonna make my fake person Italian. Will, I need quarters. Well, I'm plumb out. But I imagine Boss Hog and the Hazard boys might have two bits. It's laundry day, ok? It was either this or a peach bridesmaid dress, and I've been wearing that all day. Oh, um, there's a roll of quarters in my top drawer right beside my eye cream and my pedicure kit. My dad would be so proud of me. Help me. Hide me. She's after me. What's the matter, does your stepdaughter want a hug? No, fruit loop. Stanley's mother's in town. You gotta let me hide out here. She'll never think to look for me in government-assisted housing. She just makes you want to give, doesn't she? Look at me. I got the shakes and for all the wrong reasons. Karen, I haven't seen you this freaked out since you turned 42. 1! 34-2-1! Pretty girl, pretty girl! Pretty girl. Karen, wouldn't it be better to just to learn to deal with her? Think about it. She's the mother of the man whose bank account you love. That relationship's not gonna go away. I see where you're going with this, Wilma but I can't have her whacked. Oh, God. Just knowing she's in town it just consumes me completely. I get I feel like I can't think about anything else. Hey, Kar. Look who put the ho in hoedown! Oh, thank you, honey. Your little costume sure brightened my day. What is this? Oh, my God! I cannot believe it. Someone took my wet laundry out of the dryer and put theirs in. That is like the rudest thing Did you do this? - No. - Well, then who did? I was thrown out of my country for informing on my neighbor. So you're not gonna tell me? Yes, I am. The guy in 12C. God bless America! Excuse me. Did you take someone's clothes out of the dryer and put yours in? Yes, I did. Those clothes were mine. Listen, I can't get into this right now. I'm in the middle of a project. Hey, buster, I'm in the middle of a project, too. It's called my life. You know what, I'm making a mix tape. And if this Alice Cooper song runs out the whole tape is ruined. Wait, that's your project? A mix tape? No, a mix tape is not a project. It's something you do between bong hits, and Excuse me, I'm talking to you. Hey, hey! Never do that! Never do that! This is my work! I wouldn't come into your dairy and unplug the milking machine. Ok, all right. You know what? What you did down in the laundry room is unacceptable. - Taking my clothes out - Hey, you're a girl. What is the most romantic Megadeath song? - What? - I had a big fight with my girlfriend. She says I'm aimless and don't have any ambition so I decided to make her this tape: "Heavy Metal Songs of Love and Devotion." Hey, good plan. Yeah, you know, I always thought that if Humphrey Bogart had just made Ingrid Bergman a mix tape she never would've gotten on that plane. What, you're gonna give me relationship advice? Yeah, that's what I need. Then maybe I could find some nice gay guy to live with for the rest of my adult life. You know what? I'm going to accept that as an apology for my laundry. I got your message. What do you need? Two tickets to the opening of the Atom Bar tonight. - Oh my god! Oh my god! - I'd love to! We're going! We're going! - Mr. D.J., put a record on - I wanna dance with my baby. Music makes the people come together! Jack, Jack. No, no, Jack, Jack. Jack. Jack. Don't do that part. Hello, boys. Got a little surprise for ya. Hide the crucifixes. Beelzebooze is here. Oh, honey. I got a fake laugh with your name all over it. Now I want you to meet my mother-in-law, Sylvia Walker. Haul it in here, Syl. Nice to meet you. May I sit down? Be my guest. That's the dragon lady? That little pocket person is the one who strikes fear in your in your heart facsimile? Well, I might have been exaggerating a little bit but, you know, I thought about it, and you're right. Getting along with people, like Madison Avenue is a two-way street. Madison Avenue is a one-way street. Oh! Well, that explains why those two cops had Driver in a choke hold last night. But you know what, the Goiter and I had a long talk and, she's not such a bad old bird after all. Right, Syl? What's that, dear? Oh, she's thinkin' about her friends in the Lollipop Guild. You know, she was a U.S.O. girl in the war between the states. Oh, Wilma, be a love and get a little snicky snack for Syl, ok? Just a little birdseed and some sugar water. You can put it anywhere. She'll find it. I just don't get it. I can't believe someone as big as Stan came out of that tiny little woman. Well, I'm no expert, but I read an article once in Skymiles magazine. Apparently, when they come out, they're much smaller. The whole thing's a horror. It's nice to see Karen, you know, put in a little effort. You know, I knew if she just reached out to her Karen? She took off. Well, what are we gonna do? We have to be at the club in less than an hour. And I still need time to soak and spritz before I can sizzle. Jack, relax. She's coming back. Karen might be evil but she's not gonna stick us with her mother-in-law for the rest of the night. - Could I get a kamikaze? - Rum and Coke, please? Hot tea, please. So, Syl, um, let me ask ya. Do you ever regret throwin' that big blue diamond in the bottom of the water where the Titanic went down? Karen's not answering. Did you try her garter phone? She has a garter ph What is she, one of the x-men? Hey, when clubbing, I put my phone in my underwear. Yeah, that's just so when it rings, you can say, "wanna grab that?" It is true. Here's the number, but you should know, it's only for real emergencies like if Sunny Von Bulow comes to and starts pointing fingers. I can see you. Karen Walker's panties. Karen, we're down at the Atom Bar. Get over here and pick up your mother-in-law. I will when you get over here and pick up your mother-in-law! - I don't have a mother-in-law. - Then the deal's off! You try. Hey, Kar. Yeah, listen. You got to come pick up the Goiter, ok? Well, see, we're at this huge party, and it's especially important to Will because he has the opportunity to have his very first gay experience. I know! I know. I know. Karen, I am not kidding around. Get your gin-soaked ass in your vodka-soaked limo and pick up your tea-soaked mother-in-law. All right, all right. Don't get your training bra in a twist. I'll be there in 20 minutes. Thank you. Sometimes you just have to be a little tough with her. - She's not coming, is she? - No. You know, something you said yesterday really stuck in my craw. What's a craw? I don't know. I think it's something like a claw. - Why didn't you just saw claw? - Can we move past this? Sure. "Crum" right in. We'll "crawk" about it. Ok, look. What you said about me and my roommate was totally off-base. I'll have you know that my relationship with Will is very healthy. We talk about everything. We spend every spare minute together. We don't date anyone that the other one doesn't approve of. That doesn't sound very healthy, but it's really more of a checkoff system. - Boy, I really got to you, didn't I? - No. I don't give a crap what you think. Then why are you up here? I could ask you the same question. Not really. I live here. You know what? I'm going to accept that as an apology for what you said about me and my roommate. You mind "crosing" the door? So, Sylvia, you having a good time? Oh, lean in, dear. There's a little something And the night's complete. It's official. We're dating. Which one? The one on the right or the one on the left? Yes. It's amazing. I'm a lawyer, I'm a nice guy, and I get no one. Jack eats Ho-Hos with chopsticks keeps a phone in his pants, he gets everyone. Why do I keep putting myself through this? It's the same old letdown every time. Of course it is, dear. How do you expect anything in your life to change if you don't change? Well, because You don't he gullet of a bird or insect. - What? - Craw. That's what a craw is. Well, now I can finish my Cheerios without wondering "why are we here?" - Look, I gotta go. - What, you got another project? As a matter of fact, I do. You know, I'm still trying to get Vicki back so I'm making her name out of pap-i-er-mâché. Out of what? You know, pap-i-er-mâché the French art of paper sculpture. It's "paper mâché," you pretentious boob. And do you really think that is going to win her back? Yep. Oh, God. Boy, do you have a lot to learn about women. I mean, tons. A lot. Much. Plenty to learn. Well, I know this much about women. When they hover in your doorway muttering tiny words they're waiting for you to ask for their advice. Wrong. - What's your advice? - Romance her. That's what women want. Do something that will take her breath away and I'm not talking about shoving her face in your hamper. - Another round. - Hey. Will Truman, right? Riverside Drive, Mastercard expires March 2003? I knew these pants were tight. I didn't think you could read the contents of my wallet through them. Scott. I'm the assistant manager at Gayle and Patty's Video. Hey. Hey, listen, so if you remind me the next time you come in, I'll give you a free microwave popcorn. I appreciate that. I really don't think I'm gonna come in and say, "Hey, remember me? You promised me a free package of Pop Secret." There's a Cassavetes double feature at the Film Forum one where Gena Rowlands is drunk and crazy the other where she's crazy and drunk. Do you want to go? Maybe get some dinner afterwards? - I don't know. - Why not? Well, for one thing, in the Eighties, when I was wearing safety pins to look cool, you were wearing them to stay dry. Give me a break. I'm 24 years old. What are you, 27? Yes, I am. But You're totally cute, but I just don't really see this You know, I usually go out with You know what? yes. Let's go out tomorrow night. Cool, so around 10:00? in bed for four hours. Ok, 9:00, we'll go out. You have your own Razor scooter, right - I'm kidding. - That was a good one. Sylvia? That's on me. I took your advice, and I have got a date tomorrow night. Oh Good for you, dear. I gotta be honest. You know, at first, I was furious with Karen that she stuck us with you but the truth is, if it weren't for you, I probably wouldn't have met that guy. - Guy? - Yeah. - Scott. - You're a fag? - What? - I helped a fairy get a date? Oh, I'm going to hell! it's over with those two, but I met my rebound couple, Bob and Chuck. - You're queer, too? - As Christmas in Bloomingdale's, girlfriend. Oh! Oh, help, police! Oh, I'm surrounded by homos! - Homos, homos, homos! - Just quiet down, Sylvia. Get away from me, you fruit! Oh, I'm a fag hag! Excuse me? Did you put your underwear in with my laundry? I needed to get you up here. Ever hear of a Post-It? Yeah, but then my underwear would still be dirty. Hi. Look at you. You've gone from pig to Pygmalion. - What do you want with me? - I just wanted to get your opinion. Yeah, Vicki always wanted to go to Venice, so I thought I can't believe it. It's amazing. - Yeah. - You can practically smell the canals. Well, that's probably just the sheets. Come, sit down. I want you to get the total experience. Just kidding. Here ya go. Would you care for some wine? ok. So Do you like this? Yeah. What are we doing? Well I just thought we'd have a nice little evening. But I thought that all of this was for Vicki. Well, she saw all this, it didn't work for her, she blew me off, I kicked her out. Anyway, here's to us. What? Are you out of your mind? Are you actually offering me a used night in Venice? Look, I'm sorry No, no, no, hey. Look, ever since You know, ever since you started yelling at me I can't stop thinking about you and besides, Vicki and I were never really right for each other. She doesn't get me. I need to be with someone who gets me. I don't get you. Yeah, but in a totally different way. I don't You are.. I I am horrified! How could you think that this would work? do you see what you're offering me? A sloppy second gondola a half-empty bottle of wine a calzone with the sauce licked off the top. Is this your idea of romance? You know nothing about women. I am so offended, I don't even know what to say. One date. - Who is it? - Tanqueray delivery. Oh, thank God.

                    			You know, you're only gonna make the Dirt Devil jealous. It's more vacuum action than you've gotten lately. Yeah, well, it's only 'cause you hide all the good attachments. Oh, look! your mom's monthly newsletter. Amazing. My mother's still afraid of call waiting but she can put together a monthly mailing with three colors and a Yiddish word jumble. Let's see what's on nutsy's mind this month. "My husband Martin had his yearly colonoscopy. Don't worry. Clean as a whistle." A whole thing here about Alice Robinson. Do you know her? God, I haven't heard that name in years. You know how every school has that one girl that all the kids make fun of? You know, bad at sports, a little overweight friends with the lunch ladies? I was that girl. Poor Alice. We did Model U.N. together and we were Madagascar and Alice had this speech impediment, so she said, "Madagathcar." The kids just tortured her. They called her "Mrs. Lazy Face". Not me. I was always very nice to her, but they were just awful. - "Hi, my name ith Alith Robinthon." - Grace "And I'm the ambathador from Madagathcar." Grace "But you can call me Mrs. Lathy Fathe." It was pretty funny. "Madagathcar." "Security counthel." She's dead. Ah, thit. Karen! finally you're here. Honey, this had better be important. I was home reading to my kids. Oh, can you imagine? So what's up, snicker poodle? My one man show, Jack 2001 has been nominated for Are you ready for this? A MAC award. A MAC Award, a MAC Award, did he say MAC Award? Yes, a MAC Award! - Oh, my god, a MAC Award? - Can you believe it? A MAC award! Oh, can you believe it? A MAC award! Honey, what the hell's a MAC Award? Only the most prestigious award in all of lower Manhattan non-transgender equity waiver gay cabaret. Well, Jack, that is fantastic. We should celebrate. - I know. I wish I had some champagne. - Yeah. Here you go, sweetie. - Fantastic. Now all we need is - Yeah. Listen, Karen, since this award means so much to me and since you had such a big part in the success of Jack 2001 I would be honored if you came as my escort. Oh, honey, that is so sweet. No. - Why? - No reason. Listen, why don't you take those twins you've been dating? We broke up. They were seeing somebody else. Besides, there might be press there and I don't want to be typecast as gay. My sessuality is my business. Honey, the award is for gay cabaret. Yeah. Still, you want to keep them guessing, you know. This is so tight. Now I know why Evita was such a bitch. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Farrah Fawcett-Majors, I've got it! The truly cool people never show up at the awards show at all. They just send a videotaped acceptance speech from some exotic location where they're making their next movie. That's what I'll do! Yeah. But where am I gonna get a video camera? Here you go, honey. - What the hell are you doing? - I'm trying to wake you up. With what, your breath? No, no. You know how I told you about Alice Robinson and her nickname "Mrs. Lazy Face"? - You gave her that nickname? - How did you know? I didn't. I'm just trying to move things along. How did it happen? Well You know how I'm really good at improv? Go on. It was the biggest event of the year the school's stand-up comedy contest. Where did you go to school, Don Rickles Junior High? Anyway, this was my big chance to get in with the cool kids. So, I'm on stage, and then, all of a sudden, this kid yells, "Do Alice!" And I knew she wasn't there, so I went "Hi, my name is Alith Robinthson but you can call me Mrs. Lathy Face." The crowd went wild. I mean, I killed. I mean, I totally killed. That is so wrong. They really thought you were funny? Will, I never said I'm sorry, and now it's too late. Which is why I'm gonna go to Schenectady to her funeral tomorrow and apologize to her dead body. Wanna come? Well, gee, that certainly sounds like a good time. - Please, please, please, Will - Grace, get real! There is no way that Alice was still carrying that around. You know, kids get teased, and they get over it. You're probably right. I mean, you got over the kids calling you "Harry Ass Truman". Wake me at 6:00. And Action! See it, settle sell it Hi. I'm Jack McFarland. I'd love to be at the MAC Awards this evening but I can't. You see, I'm on the set of my new movie Karen, maybe this was a bad idea. This doesn't even look like a movie set. Honey, come on. Just say what I told you. Fine. I'm on the set of my new movie "Poorly Decorated Crackhouse." Oh Directing is fun. Keep going. Keep going. I'd like to congratulate the other nominees. After all the You know what, Karen? This just isn't working for me. Just doesn't feel right. I wanna show them I'm sincere but I haven't gotten that far yet in my acting class. We're still on "Learning how to Listen" which I don't know how to do, so I just open my eyes really wide and nod. Well, I'm going next-door to get the champagne. I wish I'd brought something stronger, but I left it in my other coat. Hi. It's Jack. I'm out since 1985. Kisses! Hey, Jack, it's Ted from the MAC Awards. Listen, bad news. There's been a horrible mix-up. Unfortunately, Jack 2001 was not nominated. It's just that there were so many gay cabaret acts with the word "Jack" in them that we got confused. Anyway, our bad. Don't be crushed. Hey, let's get a juice sometime. Esca-lator! Welcome. I am so sorry for your loss. Thank you. I actually knew Alice years ago. There's so many things I wish I had the chance to say to her. Well, I'm sure she knew how you felt about her. Let's hope not. Oh, my God, there's Gabe. Well, hello, Gabe. I remember at school everyone used to say that Alice's best feature was her older brother Gabe. Oh, gosh, he looks so sad. Sad Oh, my God! He's wearing Prada shoes. He's gay. This is great! And sad. Very, very sad. Will, straight men wear Prada. Not in Schenectady. I have to go do this now, Mr. Sensitive. Hi, Alice. It's me, Grace Adler - Hi. - Hi. God, you know, my grandmother would be so touched if she saw how many people came out today. I am Alice Robinson. Nice to meet you. Oh, Grace - Come on. Let's get out of here. - Aren't you going to apologize to Alice? - I'll catch her at the next reunion. - I don't believe you! Will, I am not going to apologize to her now. She's alive. It could be really awkward. I can't What Grace! What happened to making amends? You owe this not only to Alice, but to yourself to do the right thing. I didn't realize you felt so strongly. Well, I do. I'm not gonna let you neglect this Hi profound moral responsibility. You're unbelievable. You just want me to stay so you could cruise. Give me a break. Come on, he's my type! He's dark and brooding and miserable Everyone is. It's a funeral! Yeah. Go apologize. He's coming back. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Gabe. I'm Will. I'm so sorry about your grandmother. Yeah, it was quite a shock. Well, not really that big of a shock. She was 94 and had a really negative outlook. - I'm sorry. - Hey, it's gonna be ok. You're gonna be ok. We'll get through this together. Hi, Alice? It's me, Grace Adler. You probably don't even remember me. We went to Hawthorne Junior High School together a million years ago. Go Cougars. Anyway, you probably already knew this, but I was the one who started the whole "Mrs. Lazy Face" thing and I'm sorry. I feel better. You bitch! - Excuse me? - That nickname followed me through high school, through college, even Harvard Med! Just last week, I had to tell my fiancé to knock it off. - But I did - For 20 years I have been afraid to talk because of my lisp. I've never even seen a single movie with Susan Sarandon or Sissy Spacek. But through it all, I knew that someday I'd be able to look you in the eye and say very clearly, you suck! Well, on the bright side, she probably never had to see anything with Sylvester Stallone. - Honey, I have - Karen, goody, you're back. I finally figured out my character. It's a guy who's happy because he won an award. It just came to me. It so works. Let's roll it. Jack, you need a vacation. Come on. when was the last time you and I took off to Bermuda on the sperm of the moment? Let's go! Karen, come on. Let's roll it. I know, but, honey, I just feel like there's a lot of things we could be doing - besides making a stupid video - Karen! We are doing this. Now, don't make me get all Whitney on your ass. Ok? I'm in my zone. Let's roll it. All right. And action. Hi. I'm Jack McFarland. You know, sometimes I ask myself why am I in this crazy business of show, anyway? Do I do it for the money? Do I do it for the glory? Do I do it for the himbos who wait at my dressing room door? No, no And yes. But more than anything else, I do it for love because this is what I love to do. Oh, my god, Karen. I just realized something. This is the biggest thing that's ever happened to me. Forget the video camera. I'm going to the MAC Awards. Honey, you didn't get nominated. What? Somebody called from the MAC awards. Ted Homosexual. He said that there was some kind of a mix-up, and you didn't even get nominated. It's ok. It's just a stupid award, anyway. I'm sorry, Jackie. Can you shut the camera off? I just kind of want to be alone right now Now, I would like to call up anyone who would like to share a few words. All right, I got to get out of here. You have exactly ten minutes to make your move on this guy. That'll give me enough time to get over to my mother's have her tell me I look awful in black, and get back here. Oh, yes. You, dear, please. You said you wanted to say something. What No, no. That was when I thought she was dead. No, no. Come on. I think you should come down and say something. I insist. Well Where to begin. Alice Robinson was So, here's to you, Mrs. Robinson. Jesus loves you more than you will know. And now, Alice has Crossed that bridge over troubled water And is hopefully feeling groovy - No longer homeward bound - Stop it! Sorry Alice Alice was Alice was She was She was very forgiving. She was not the kind of person who would hold a grudge over some childish nickname. We all had those, right? I had plenty Like "Gross" Adler. - And Gosh, what was that other one? - Flatsy Patsy. - Right. thank you. - Bigfoot. - Ok. - Mop Top, Scarlet Pimple. Stop it. My point being that I I know what it feels like to be made fun of, and I know it's not a good feeling. So, if Alice was here today, all I'd really want to say to her is I'm sorry if I ever hurt her and wherever she is, I hope she'll forgive me. This day is hard for all of us. Yes, it is. Is Gabe seeing anyone? Honey, I know not winning that award was a big disappointment but believe me, in my eyes, you're a winner. Yeah. There's no better mo out there. I don't care what you think. I don't care what anybody thinks. Without a MAC award, I'm nothing! I thought you might be feeling this way. So, I racked my rack, and then it came to me. I'll get him a cute boy to ease his pain. But then I thought "No" "Jackie's not that shallow." And then I thought "Hey, diamonds are a girl's best friend. I'll get him jewelry!" But then I thought "No" "Jackie's a lot more complicated than that." And then it hit me. "Nothing takes the sting out of failure like a big, fat check. I'll give him money." But then I thought "No" "My Jackie can't be bought. He's an artist. He has brought joy to fives and tens of people with his cabaret act. That's what's really important to him." I guess you're right. I fooled you! Check it out, Jackie. The dude, the diamonds, and the dough. Honey, you're simple, you're shallow, and you're a common whore. That's why we're soul mates. Oh, Karen. You're my best friend in the whole world. - Thanks for coming, Will. - Oh, no problem. I hope this isn't forward or inappropriate, but, you know, I thought we sort of made a connection before you know, and we had that great hug, and Can I call you sometime? Are you hitting on me at my grandmother's funeral? - Well, I just - Have you no shame? I'm embarrassed for you. - Let's keep our voices down. - He's hitting on me. Anyway, I really appreciate what you said today. It took a lot of guts to come here and say that. Well, thank you for understanding. I teach a speech therapy class in the city a couple days a week and, you know, maybe we could get together and have a drink sometime. I would really love that. Hey, you know, in fact, some of my students are here today. Would you like to meet them? - Sure. - Ok. Be careful. that coffee's very hot. Oh, hot, hot! Grace Adler, this is Cindy, this is Jason, and this is Sarah. Hi, Thindy. Hi, Jathon. Hi, Tharah. You bitch! Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			Well, this is it. Thanks for walking me home. It was fun. I especially liked the part where the waiter asked me how he could get involved with the Big Brothers of America. He just said that because you're older than me. Yeah, I got that part. Can I come up? I don't know, Scott. My roommate might be home. She's not good with new people. You know, she grew up without people. Did you ever see Nell? There is - Are you embarassed of me? - Heh. No. Yes. Look, I have a really good time with you, but you are 23. And three-quarters. See. Just the fact that your age has fractions in it. Look, just give me a little time to adjust, ok? Ok. Oh, I brought you some movies from work. They're due back on Thursday. Although, if you brought them in on Friday I'd waive that late fee. Yeah, it helps to know people in high places. Dinner tomorrow. Dinner tomorrow. And just think, I'll be one day older. I want to thank you for a very nice evening. Yeah. So, listen I'm not really sure how to say what I wanna say here but I wanna be a gentleman about it so since I paid for dinner, I think it'd be great if we went to your place and you took off your shirt and we got to at least, like, second. And First of all, you're a pig - And second, you're a child. - Who You're a child. You are totally inappropriate. You have no self-control. What are you talking about? At dinner, you went "ptttb", and turned to the table next to us and said "Can you believe that came out of her?" Hey, so, do you have those Breathe-Right strips? 'Cause you look like a snorer to me. Look, you don't have to worry about it because you're not coming in, ever. Besides, my roommate might be home. So, are you embarrassed of me? Of course I am. So, good-bye. Don't call me. Have a nice life. - So, tomorrow night? - I'll be ready at 7:00. I'll be here at 8:00. Oh, damn you. - Hi. - Hi. - Where you been? - What have you been up to? - Oh, I've had the craziest night - I was gonna go to a movie - I was on my way home from work - We talked - and then this cab came out of nowhere - We talked about yoga and about why he was fat - I went to the Museum of Modern Art - I talked so much, so I didn't even get a chance to see my movie. Good night. - Hi, Jack. - Hi, Val. You look pretty today, Jack. Thank you. I was thinking the same thing myself. What's up? Well, I'm soliciciting donations for a food drive so if you have any spare canned goods, that would be great. Sure, come on in. I think I have some soup and tuna. Oh, fantastic! - Here. - Just put it in here. Hey, would you like to come over for dinner later? Oh. What you making? Soup and tuna. Yeah, rain check. - I'm on my way to the theater. - Oh, yeah?

Listen I've been meaning to tell you about something and I don't know why I've waited so long, but Oh, God, my collar is wet! That jerk sneezed on me! Which jerk? That loser you got into it with last week, from the laundry room. The one that wears the T-shirt that says, "Your mom's hot." Oh, yeah. That guy. He's not so bad. You don't think he's kind of charming? Yeah, he's real charming, you know, like finding a Band-Aid in your burrito is charming. I'm sorry. You were saying something. Oh. lost it. So, you going out? Yeah, later In fact, I wanted to tell you some Did you return the videos? - Yeah, this morning. - You know the guy Course, I had to deal with that little snot behind the counter. Assistant manager Scotty Sender. That little twerp charges me that bogus rewind fee every time I go in there. God, I hate 12-year-olds with power. I'm sure he's not 12, Grace. He's gotta be at least 23 and 3/4. Well, he's a punk. He should respect his elders. - So, who you going out with? - Nobody. You? Nobody. - Well, have fun. - Well, have fun. When you caught between the moon and New York City. - I'm stuck. I can't get out! - The best that you can do the best that you can do is fall in love, two, three, four, off. Thank you so much. Thank you. - Karen, I just totally killed. - Well, something died tonight. I'm glad you liked it. You know, I think the difference was adding a dramatic reading. Did you enjoy the penis monologues? I don't know, honey. I'm not a big fan of ventriloquism. Constructive criticism. It's in. I'm assessing it. I'm not hearing it. It's gone. So, you sticking around for the next show? Oh, honey, I would, but I don't want to. Oh, you're gonna love this. I've seen every show tonight: the 7:00, the 7:15, and the 7:30. Look. Jack even signed my chest. - Can I see it again? - Sure. - Can I see it again? - Ok. Can I see it again? Can I see it again? The show's starting. The show's starting. Ladies and gentlemen welcome to "Jack 2001: A Space Odyssey". Reaching to Uranus and beyond. The best that you can do, cha cha cha the best that you can do, Chaka Khan is fall in love. Two, three, four, off. Thank you. Thanks for sticking round. Oh my God, Jack. That was the best show ever. It felt like you were singing only to me. Well, for the last seven shows, I was. Look, I don't know what to say. I just I really just wanna officially thank you for coming into my life. It's just that, well, you're my world now. Yeh, about that See the problem is I live here and I'm thinking you live way up here. Are you sure, honey? 'cause I thought I had a stalker once. It turns out it was just Rosario running alongside of the limo, banging on it because she got her coat caught in the door. Yes, Val is totally stalking me. She followed me to the Banana, she followed me to the gym and last night, I am sitting in the bushes outside Kevin Bacon's apartment and I see Val watching me through the other bushes across the street! Fun date, huh? Yeah, nothing spells romance like free soft-drink night at the Pig and Whistle. Did you have onions in your veggie weggie tub? No. Good. 'cause I'm going to kiss you like you've never been kissed before. Oh! First of all, I have been kissed like that by my Aunt Honey And, second of all, you don't tell someone that you're about to kiss them. You sneak up on them when they Yeah, like that. You're going to go now, and that was absolutely our last date. I hear you, and I respect your wishes. I think it'd be great if I came in and took a bath. What? No! No. Go home. My roommate I'm getting the feeling that you don't want me to meet your friends. It's not just that. It's, you know, I'm feeling like And you're like And I'm like And, you know, it's just You know what I'm saying? Oh, yeah, I know what you're saying. You want my sex. Good night. - Oh, hold the door. - No, no, no, no! Oh, no! Going down? You cut right to the chase, don't you? I like you. I like you. But I'm off the market. I got this redhead on the ninth floor, who's crazy about me. Redhead? Crazy? Surprise! What the hell are you doing here? - I live here. - No, you don't! - I'm carrying your baby. - No, you're not! - You're a musical genius. - Ok, I'll give you that one. - But, Val, you don't - Jack, don't you understand? When you sing to me You make me feel special. It's like I'm no longer that sad, angry little girl running around the schoolyard stabbing kids with pencils. Someone put a little extra crazy powder in the protein shake. Ok, come on. We're going to sit down and have a little talk, all right? Man to whack-job. I thought that it was very flattering when you first started coming to the show I'm wearing your dirty bath water in a vial around my neck. Ew, that's enough! I've had it! All right? So I'm going to tell you what Justin Timberlake Matt Lauer and Moesha said to me. "Stay away, or I'll call the police!" I pretended that your jockstrap was an oxygen mask all day today. And time to go, psycho! - But, Jack, I love you! - No, I need you to go, Val. - No! I love you! - Get out! Crazy lady! - No! I love you! - Get out! - I love you. - Get out! You're crazy! Forget it. I might as well just buy a dirty magazine. Don't you find it unbelievably frustrating - when it takes forever to get online? - Will, just buy a dirty magazine. You don't know me. Oh, Karen called. What? Karen called? Did she say anything? What'd she say? Did she say anything? What'd she say? She said she's on her way over. She apparently has some great big surprise she wants to share. Maybe she's found a way to freeze-dry evil so that we can drink it when she's not here. So, Karen's coming over now? Shouldn't you leave? Don't you have something to do? - Like what? - Gym? - Went. - Eat? - Poop? - Twice. - Lucky. - Grace What's the matter? Ok. all right. Listen. You're going to find out anyway as soon as Karen gets here, so You know the guy from the laundry room that you were talking about Nathan? Oh, what the jerk that sneezed on my neck? Yeah, what's the latest? Is he still throwing lizards down the mail chute, then racing them to the lobby? He is. - And I'm dating him. - What? All right. Look, before you say anything I know that there are parts of him that are disgusting and childish and weird, but he can also be really sweet and charming and romantic and I know this makes absolutely no sense, and it's probably going nowhere but there it is. I've been dating sneezy. Well Since we're sharing, I guess there's something I should tell you. What? I'm hurt you should lie to me. I'm sorry. I guess I don't know. I guess I just felt little embarrassed. Well, excuses. It's just that it hurts, that's all. Will, come on. What could I do to make it up to you? Oh, it's not a big deal. You know, what am I supposed to say take out the garbage, do the dishes and pick up the dry cleaning for a month? Would it make you feel better if I did all that? It's a place to start. Hello, kiddies. Are you ready for your big surprise? It's too late. Will already knows. - About the ring? - What ring? Honey, do you remember that afternoon that you and I were walking down Fifth Avenue and we saw that beautiful ring in the window of Tiffany's and you said to me, "If only, one day, I could own a ring like that?" Yeah I bought it for myself! Isn't that great? That's your surprise? Yeah. What the hell'd you think it was? I thought you were going to tell Will that I was dating Nathan. The hottie who smells like rope? You know what? Shame on you, Grace. I would think that by now you would know me well enough to know that I am not the kind of person who trades in gossip and I'm hurt that you think I do. - I'm sorry. - Your business is your business just the same way it's Will's business that he's dating that mouseketeer from the video store. That what? You know, I can pick up the dry cleaning. And I can take out the garbage. The dishes are mine and you know what? Starting next month I'm going to pay you to live here. Something's very wrong if if we're this embarrassed about our boyfriends I do. We shouldn't be seeing these guys, should we? Probably not. I guess I'll go down to the video store and see if can catch Scott at recess. Lucky you. Yours has a job. I think it's better if we don't see each other anymore. If that's what you think. If that's what you think. I'm sure I'll see you around. Damn you. This has gotta stop, ok? I mean, for the love of pizza you left me 15 messages already. Please, please, come in. I really missed you at the show tonight, Val. - It just felt empty. - Oh, really? Well, too bad because you made your bed, and now I'm not going to lie in it. Ok, all right. Well, I'm not going to beg. - Ok. Bye. - Please, come back. Please, Val! - Oh, Jack, forget it! You're insane. - Please. I need to come back! - Oh, Jack. - Please, stalk me! Stalk me, Val. - You're embarrassing yourself. - Jack 2001. Jack 2001. Please, come on. Jack, you're embarrassing yourself! Jack! Oh, sorry. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			How's the letter to your daddy coming, poodle? Just got to give it a little kiss a little spritz a little kiss a little spritz. You know, we've narrowed down the identity of Jack's father. It's either one of the eleven Black brothers of New Canaan, Connecticut or Paul Lynde, the center square. So I'm writing to each one of the brothers and here's what I have so far "Dear Mr. Black, my name is Jack McFarland, M.D." Please hold all comments till the end! "If you were at a costume party in 1968 wearing a Nixon mask and had sexual relations with a woman who was dressed as the back part of a horse you're my father! Please understand that I am not asking for money." Yeah. I know, right? "My phone number is" blah blah. "You can call me between the hours of" blah and blah. "Sincerely" blah, blah, blah. "Oh, P.S. " blah. So what do you think? I'd replace the first blah with the second blah, and I think the letter's ready to go. I'm rethinking my scuba outfit for the trip. 'Cause Joe and Larry are gonna be all in basic black and I've got red flippers and a yellow snorkel. Even the clownfish are gonna be like, "Mmm, too busy." Oh, my god. There he is. Don't look around like a crazy person. Who? where? Who? where? there? Was it the simplicity of the instructions that confused you? Over at the counter. What do I call him? Is he my boyfriend? My significant other? How about the man you're afraid to talk to? That works too. Now, tell me again how you two didn't end up as a couple? Well we never met at the gym and one thing didn't lead to another. Classic boy-doesn't-meet-boy story. Oh, Lord, what have I done to deserve this? Oh, right. Oh, look, honey. It's your non-imaginary boyfriend. What's his name Jethro? Billy Bob? He's not my boyfriend. I don't have a boyfriend. - She dumped that loser. - No, she didn't. - Yes, I did. - She did. - No, she didn't. - I said I did. Sorry, that wasn't meant for you. Oh, hey, baby. I didn't know you were here. Hi. Oh, hi, Willard. I like your leotard. Listen, I'm gonna grab a juice. I'll be back to smooch on you in a second. So the whole time you've been dating this guy sneaking around behind my back? God! I feel like Captain Von Trapp and you're Liesl making out with that Nazi in the gazebo. We're not dating. My God, you overstate everything. How many times have you seen him? I don't know. A couple of times. Two12 Oh, so that's why when you disappear every night for five hours, you bring me back a little present. You're just trying to create a diversion so I wouldn't ask you any questions. Hey, what are you complaining about? You got some lovely things. How many compliments have you gotten on that leotard? It's not a leotard! It's a fitted-T. Please, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I've kept this from you. But what can I say? I like him. A lot. You know, do what you want. I just Keep him away from me. Fine. I just-- God, I just wish that you didn't have this thing with him. Can't you at least be my friend and say you're happy for me? I'd like to. But you know, if he's in your life, he's in my life - and I can't - Not even for some cashmere toe socks? I've been dying for these! Karen! guess what? I found him! I found my daddy! He wrote back! Oh, peanut, that's fantastic. What'd he say? He says his name is Joe, and there's way too much to explain in the letter and that he wants to meet me in person. Oh, honey, I am so happy for you. I am gonna throw you a fabulous dinner party so that you can meet your daddy in style. You'd do that for me? You'd open your home to me and my family? Well, when you put it that way no. We'll do it at Will and Grace's. Hey, it'll give them a chance to break out the good plastic. Oh, that was really nice. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. You know, I'm gonna write you a little letter of recommendation because that should be on your résumé. Let me ask you. How would you rate me? What do you mean? On a scale from one to ten. And remember, the rule is on the first time it's polite to round up. I'm not gonna rate you. I don't like it, either, but that's the world we live in. Oh All right. Eight. - You were a seven. - What? That's good. I've never been with anyone above a four. You're a pig. Now, let's see if I can bring that score up to 7.2. I'm not here, I'm not here. I'm just looking for the phone. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Vicky, the ex. I'm Grace. The nude. Vick, can you give us an hour? Come back later? An hour? Who are you kidding? I'll be back in five minutes. I'm gonna get you for that! Where were we? Why is your ex-girlfriend still in your apartment? Don't worry, she's cool. You're secure enough to handle me living with my ex-girlfriend, right? Hey, Will. Nathan's gonna be living here for a while. Careful. that's a nasty paper cut waiting to happen. Three second rule still good. I'm not happy right now. See this face? It's not a happy face. What was I supposed to do, let him stay up there with her? It's creepy having a third person around. You don't say. Oh, he's using my new Chantal sauté pan with a metal-edge spatula. There is no way a crèpe is ever gonna slide off that now. You are more gay before nine A.M. than most people are all day. All right, hope you guys like my phony bologna free-range omelets. Ah, yes. It's only bean curd, but it's got the look of pig. I thought you gay guys liked the bologna. I think you're confusing the bologna with the same rights and privileges afforded to married couples. Will, lighten up. It's breakfast, not a pelvic exam. Well, forgive me if I don't leap to take advice from someone whose family portrait includes two bloodhounds and a pickup truck. Is it just me, or are the squirrels in the park sneakier? Well, I get it. Because I'm from the South, I must be stupid and because you're gay, you must be clever. Just goes to show you how wrong those stereotypes can be. Boy, if this day gets any better, by noon I should be rolling in glass. Nathan. I might have been a little harsh on him. He does have a flair for "repartee." This has gotta stop. You've got to get along with Will. - I'm just being myself. - I know, baby. That's what's gotta stop. Honey, what is going on here? There's fingerprints on the China spots on the silver, the vodka is warm. What is this, junior high? Now, Jack is meeting his actual father tonight. Get it together. Hey, back off or I will force you into brightly colored poly blend. What's with the gratuitous violence, Hannibal Adler? Hello, will my moped be safe outside the building? Yeah. Miss Karen, thank you for inviting me. I know that Jack and I aren't married anymore but part of me still thinks of him as family. Oh, that's sweet, honey, but you're not here to attend the party you're here to work the party. So, strip off that bug trap you call a jacket put on an apron, and shake hands with Mr. Clean. Sorry I took so long. I ran into my imaginary boyfriend down at the market. He was standing in the checkout line, so I had no choice but to check him out. Did you talk to him? I would've, but I was too busy choking on my fear. Oh, hello, Grace-ious. I'm sorry. I didn't realize that this dinner was formal. Oh, it's an easy mistake. I'm sure that's considered formal wear at Señor Frog's. Well, I guess it doesn't work here at Señor Tightass. What is he doing here? I just figured since Jack was meeting his father for the first time tonight, that the whole evening could have a theme Togetherness, you know? Jack and his father You and Nathan Karen and her drink Thanks for coming. I love you. Will, this is a temporary arrangement, and he's important to me so as long as he's here, will you just make an effort? Please, it would mean so much to me. Fine, fine, but I'll tell you right now, I am not gonna whittle or tie my pants with a rope. So, Nathan, tell me, what kind of work do you do? Oh, I don't work. I've got my spleen money. Right, right. I don't know what that means. Well, about a year ago, I took a spill on my motorbike wheel came off, I went flying lost a spleen. The bike company coughed up a butt-load of money and I've been living off of that ever since. - Pretty cool, huh? - Yeah, with the market being down the way it is you may want to lacerate a kidney and reinvest. Well, I've got my IRA. - What do you do? - I'm a lawyer. I'm a man without a spleen. You're a man without a heart. Maybe we should take a trip to Oz. Hello, what's going on? What'd I miss? We're just saying what we do for a living. Oh, bad topic for both of you. How about things that you have in common likes, dislikes? Well, I hate making small talk with people that I have nothing in common with. Me, too. See? there you go. But what I really hate is when someone licks their finger like this And then sticks it in my ear like that. This has been fun. Yeah, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go dip my head in alcohol. Oh, wait for me. Wait for Papa, can you hear me? Papa, can you see me? Papa, can you find me in the night? Oh, hey, crunchy. I don't believe we've met. Nathan. I'm Grace's boyfriend. That's weird. I'm not getting a gay vibe from you. So, how you doing, pal? you ready? Yeah, I think so. I did a papaya salt scrub a cucumber mask, a hot oil scalp treatment and two shots of wheatgrass. Wow, you're more than ready. You're a gay salad bar. Everything's food with you, isn't it? What do you think dad's gonna be like? Oh, I Don't care if he's rich or poor fat or thin, just as long as he's rich and thin. Oh, honey, take it from me. Rich and fat works, too. Uma Thurman Hawke, he's here! Ok, I'm gonna answer the door. No, that'll seem needy, but I am needy, but needy's not hot but I'm hot, so it doesn't matter. Papa, can you hear me? Jack, take it easy. You're having a Yentl breakdown. Ok. I'm gonna play it cool and let him come to me. Hi. I'm Jo Black. I'm looking for Jack McFarland. Daddy! No, no, there's something I need to explain. I know, daddy. You're a woman, but on some level, who isn't? No, Jack. No, no. That's why I wanted to meet you in person. My name is JoAnne Black. I'm Joe Black's wife. Oh, nice to meet you. Where's my papa? I am so sorry. I really don't quite know how to say this, but your father died five years ago. Will you excuse me for a minute? Honey, it must be a relief to finally have someone else kill your party. How you doing? Come on, Jack. You've been in here all night. Come on, talk to me. Who's the prettiest lady in this room? Me. My dad is gone, Will. I'm never gonna meet him. He'll never teach me to ride a bike or throw a ball or kiss a man. I'm totally alone. Jack, what have you really lost here? I mean, it would have been great if you'd gotten to know him but he was not part of your life before. He's not part of your life now. What's really changed? But I loved him. But you didn't know him. But I loved him. Maybe you just loved the idea of him. He was the source of all my talent. But you don't have any talent. - But I loved him. - And here we are again. Coming in, coming in. Aam I interrupting anything? Are you fellas having sex? - Oh, stop. - Oh, God. Well, you know, I figured both of you being gay and all Yeah, that's pretty much how it works. Just like if you see any woman. - Yeah. - Ok, bad analogy. What do you want? Well, I thought after what happened tonight maybe Jack could use a little Jack. Hello. Thanks, Nathan, but when we're in pain we usually prefer just to talk it out rather than, say, gettin' all liquored up and going down to the dump and shooting rats. I was thinking more of a memorial of sorts. You know, when someone close to you dies it's important to remember them, drink a toast, say good-bye. No, like I said, I don't think that's the way Jack I wanna do it. - What? - I loved him. - But you didn't know him. - But he loved him, Willard. Ok. Why don't you start, Will? - Oh, I don't know. I mean - Come on, Will. For me. Ok. I never had the opportunity to meet Joe Black. Saw the movie, though. A bit long, didn't care for it Even though it had Brad Pitt in it. Didn't care for Snatch, either. The movie. Anyway Here's to you, Joe. We hardly knew you. Actually, we didn't know ye at all. To Joe. - Well, thank you, Will. - Jack, you're up. First of all, I'd like to say thank you to Joe Black. Thank you for giving me my piercing blue eyes my impossibly high cheekbones my rock-hard ass And my feminine side Which I did not get from my mother. In conclusion Papa, how I love you papa how I need you papa how I miss you kissing meeee good niiiiiiiiight - Looking in the sky - To Joe! Well, terrific. I'm glad we did that. It was a nice idea. Jack, you want to do something? Maybe go down to the park and laugh at the heterosexuals kissing? Wait a minute. I'd like to say something about Joe. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. After all, you knew him as well as we did. We're born, we grow, we live, we die. If we're lucky, we have family and friends who know us and love us. I never knew my dad. But it doesn't matter. because wherever we go and whatever we do we can know that the spirit of the mother and the spirit of the father are alive in each of us. That everything good already exists within ourselves. So, here's to Joe the father in all of us. To Joe. Thank you, Nathan. Ok, who wants another round? Oh, my God. I've turned another one.

                    			Hey, Will. Nathan's gonna be living here for a while. You know, we've narrowed down the identity of Jack's father. It's either one of the eleven Black brothers of New Canaan, Connecticut or Paul Lynde, the center square. I hope you guys like my phony bologna free-range omelets. Ah, yes. It's only bean curd, but it's got the look of pig. I thought you gay guys liked the bologna. I don't know, you maybe stay with Nathan forever. I can feel  it in some of my original bones. It's just a matter of time before you're driving a mini-van full of screaming kids to K-Mart to pick out curtains for your mud hut in Tarrytown. Nice to meet you. Where's my papa? I am so sorry. I really don't quite know how to say this, but your father died five years ago. Oh, my God. I've turned another one. Incoming! How have I lived without phony bologna omelets? Wait till you try my southern fried I-can't-believe-it's-not-chicken. - Can we have dinner at 6:00? - How about dinner at 8:00? I get too hungry for dinner at 8:00. That's why the lady is tramp! Oh, my god. You did sleep together. Grace, if you're gonna think I'm gay every time I pass out with men, you're in for a lifetime of heartache. Hey, little Willie, you have any socks I can borrow? Both mine are in the wash. Top drawer. Help yourself. There's a small black leather pouch at the back of the drawer. Just disregard that. Morning, sickness. I don't know which one of you it was. But last night, someone's hand repeatedly brushed up against James and the giant peaches. That was your hand, Jack. Ah. I didn't know I was such a tease. How are you feeling this morning? I'm in the third stage of the grieving process. I'm past anger and denial and into leather. Hello? Oh, hi, Larry. What? Not the scuba trip! Watch, he's gonna go up an octave. Come on! We have been planning this Fine, fine. Thanks a lot. No, I don't want to talk to Hannah.. Don't put the kid on. Don't Hi, Hannah. Hi. Your daddies are losers. Bye. What? "I would have sent flowers but they're not as much fun to jump up and down on. Love, Nathan." Honey, what's that? What's going on? What's happening? Are you jumping or am I on under-medicated? I am jumping on my little gift from my boyfriend. You know what? If I had your boobs I'd have two black eyes right now. Yeah. You'd also have a rich husband. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that it's a dopey gift because it doesn't have "Tiffany" or "Cartier" or "may cause drowsiness" on it. But I will tell you something. I like Nathan, and I don't care what you think. So, what do you think? Oh, honey, where do I begin? He's crude, he's crass. Last night at the party he dropped an ice cube down my blouse just so he could fish it back out again. Oh, honey, I love him. - Really? - Yeah, I think you found the one. - Well, the one for now. - Oh, pshaw. Come on. The only thing to do now is get a blood test pick out a big, white cake and get a copy of "Sloppy Bride" magazine. Not so fast. We've only been going out for two weeks. It took me longer to pick out my screen name and it's "Grace Adler." I don't know. I think you're gonna be with Nathan forever. I can feel it in some of my original bones. it's just a matter of time before you're driving a mini-van full of screaming kids to K-Mart to pick out curtains for your mud hut in Tarrytown. And you know what the best part is? Now, you can start phasing Nathan in and Will out. Yeah, you know, it's like it says in the Bible. "When you've got the beau, who needs the 'mo?" Ok, we have a problem. I don't see three seats together. Well, there's two over there, and there's those two there. All right, I'm gonna ask that couple to move. Be nice. What? I'm always nice. - Excuse me, I hate to bother you - We're not moving. You suck. I hope you're sitting on gum. I'm sorry. He's just angry because I'm making him see Chocolat again. And besides, that seat's broken. Oh, great. We can't sit together. Let's just go see another movie. No, I don't want to miss Chocolat. It's magical. Look, I'll take that one over there, and you guys take these two. - It's fine. - All right. Well We'll see you later and if you need anything, just, you know go get it. You know, the truth is, I'm glad it's just us because there's something I've been wanting to say to you. Yeah, I've never been the first one to say this in a relationship, but - I'm just gonna do it. Grace, I - Oh, will you excuse me a minute? What? I need to be sitting next to Will when the candy band plays. - The what? - You know, the candy band the ad for the concession when the different types of candy play different instruments and the box of popcorn is out on a date with the sexy soda. Anyway, Will and I have this little thing that we do when the box of Goobers gets his nose stuck in the screen. Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Oh, gosh! Ok, someone's gonna need a new soda. What are you doing here? You know I don't like to be near you when the candy band comes on. I think that Nathan is about to say "I love you". Yeah? Isn't that too much? Isn't it too soon? When he tells you he loves you, that's wonderful. God, if I could get a guy to say he loved me, I wouldn't be here. Oh, who am I kidding? Of course I would. I love Chocolat. No, no, no. You don't understand. If he says "I love you", then that That just starts a whole chain of events in motion and before I know it I'm living in a mud hut in Tarrytown. I have no idea what you're talking about. Now, just please, get out of here, ok? I don't want you here when the nose gets stuck. Go! Excuse me. Pardon me. Oh, God. Someone's gonna need popcorn. Excuse me. Hi. I'm sorry about that. Now let's just watch the movie. Oh, hey there, muffin. How are you doing with this whole dad thing? Better, I think. I have light days and heavy days. Today's a light day. I could even ride a horse. Well, I give you credit. Boy, if I'd spent two years of my life looking for my dad only to find out he's dead I don't think there'd be a pill big enough to kill that pain. Oh, who am I kidding? They'd make me one. Excuse me. Are you Karen Walker? Why? Did her step-son sit on you? No. - Did her driver accidentally run you over? - No. Are you an employee at one of her husband's - textile factories in Jakarta? - No. I'm Karen Walker. How can I help you? well, I went to your house because that's the last address I had. - I'm looking for Jack McFarland. - Why? does he owe you money? No. Did he steal some of your jokes for his cabaret act? No. You missing a scooter you probably weren't using anyway? No. Hi, I'm Jack McFarland. You are? Wow. I mean, hi. I'm Elliot. Well, what can we do for you, little man? well, 13 years ago, did you donate your"stuff" to a "stuff" bank called the New York Family Clinic? Let's see. I think I did have an account at that bank. Well, my mom was a nurse there, and she wanted a baby real bad so she took yourdonation. I'm your son. I'm gonna talk to him. I'm gonna talk to him. Tomorrow, I am gonna talk to him. Great news. Guess where we're going on Friday. To the drugstore so you can stock up on Campho-Phenique? I'm just going by what we did last Friday. Ok, I'll give you a hint "We'll always have Paris." - Paris? - No! Casablanca. Morocco, you ninny! Look! two tickets! I wanted to go to Morocco ever since college! I know! Well, I figured, since your scuba trip was canceled it's just a perfect opportunity for us to finally go. Can you really take the time off? Well, I talked to my boss, which is me. She's a bit of a bitch, but then I threatened to quit and she's all, "You can't quit. You're fired." And I'm all, "You can't fire me. I quit." - Finish this, babe. - We're going to Morocco! Three fun-filled weeks! I've already booked the whole thing with Jeanette the bitter-for-no-reason travel agent. - Why is she bitter? - No reason. God! Morocco! This is gonna be great, you know? We're gonna be rocking the casbah, even if the sharif don't like it. - What about Nathan? - What about him? Well, you guys just started to get serious Isn't it really kind of a bad time to leave? Oh, Don't worry about Nathan. He'll be fine. - Ok. - Morocco! Hey, isn't that your imaginary boyfriend? Yeah. I'm being coy today, you know? I'm his coy toy. I'm his koi pond. No wonder I'm alone. I came as fast as I could. Where's my red chinchilla warm-up suit? Honey, I lied. There is no suit. And I fell for it! Twice in one day! Honey, you have a child. You've gotta start dealing with that. This again? Since when do you care so much about family? Hey! I'm the one who cared enough about my dying grandfather to walk up a mountain every day to tend to him. Yeah, even after they took me away to be Clara's companion I never forgot about him, no. In fact, I got Clara out of that wheelchair just so I could get back to my dear grandpapa. Karen, that's not you. That's Heidi. Oh. Then what's my story? Look, my mind is made up. I don't want to see that kid, ok All right, but I've got a small man in the back who's ready to give you a red chinchilla warm-up suit. Really? Come on out, sir! She did it again! All right, now get in there. You two are gonna stay in here till you work something out. Mr. McFarland, I didn't mean to freak you out. I just wanted to meet you. Yeah, well, we don't need to meet, ok? Because I'm not your father. But you are. My mom still has your file. It says that you were a ballet dancer and model who enjoys long walks on the beach. That's not me. And it says that you were part of a performing group called "Jack and the Beanstalk". That was a solo act! Listen, Elliot, I can't do this with you, ok? A kid just does not fit into my "E! True Hollywood Story." But I don't want anything from you. I just thought every once in a while we could, I don't know, hang out or something maybe throw a ball Or watch hockey Or see a Jackie Chan movie? Dear God! What has not having a father done to you? So, what do you think? Yeah, I Listen, Elliot, I'm sorry, but It's ok. It doesn't matter. I mean, what do you care? You don't know what it's like not to know your father. Actually, I do. I didn't know my father, either. - Really? - My dad was some anonymous stranger in a Nixon mask who did my mom at a pool party - Who's Nixon? - I don't know. Didn't you ever wonder who your dad was, and if he was like you? Yeah, I used to. For a while, you know, every drop-dead gorgeous guy I'd see I'd yell "daddy" and see if they turn around. I used to pretend my dad was Spiderman. My God, you must be psychic, because I have been known to scale tall buildings to get out of sticky situations. Well, I've met you. I guess I should go. Yeah. You know, if you're not in a hurry, you maybe wanna go grab a burger or something? Yeah, I guess. You buying? Heh, I was just gonna ask you the same thing. Hey, it gets pretty chilly out there, so - So, where are you from? - I'm from Queens. Yes, you are, but we'll talk about that when you're older. Ok. gel, mousse thickener, volumizer wet look, dry look megahold Something in here I don't need. Oh, shampoo. Just came to return your socks. You don't need to wash them. I only wore them a day or two. - You just missed your girlfriend. - You mean ex-girlfriend. What? She broke up with me. She what? That's impossible! She didn't say anything to me and she tells me everything. Obviously not everything. Did she say why? Well, she talked for a long time about her life and her future and how I'm macaroni salad and she's kugel with raisins and by the time she started quoting lyrics to "Desperado," I was lost. Why would she break up with you? You're sensitive, you're smart, you're funny you've got an ass that won't quit. It's just so, you know Just it's perfect and round and you just Again, why? why? You got me. Maybe it's like she said "Been out riding fences for so long now". I mean, I'm a hard one, but I got my reasons. I Don't know what to tell you. She's crazy. And just when you think you've reached the bottom level of her craziness there's a crazy underground garage. Well, yeah, somebody may have shot out her porch light but I do love her. Have a nice trip. - God, finally, you're here. - Why did you break up with Nathan? Look, I just wanna get on the plane, go to Morocco and start having some fun. - Do we have to talk about this right now? - Yes, we do. I don't see a future with him, ok? I'm 27 years old. I'm not getting any younger. Really? Beause in that sentence, you got five years younger. - Let's go. - No. Talk to me! - I don't wanna talk - Tell me! - It wasn't working out, ok? - Why? - He's weird! - He's interesting. - He's childish. - He's fun. - He's aimless. - He could change your life. - That's what I'm afraid of. - Yeah, but why? I like my life. I like our thing. If things start working out with Nathan, then everything's gonna change. Good! Grace So it changes. I just don't want you using me as an excuse for not getting on with your life. - That's not what I'm doing. It's just that - Do you love him? Do I what? Don't do Fiddler with me. I'm asking you a question. Do you love him? It is not that simple. Do you love him? I don't know. Maybe Well, go find out. race, you got two choices here You take the easy route Fly to a third-world country, ride a camel and wake up in a tent beside the swarthy prince who bought you. Or you can take a risk in your life get in that car, go back to the apartment, and see what happens with you and Nathan. I knew you'd choose me. You know, I just as easily could have gotten on that plane and Could be on the way to Morocco right now With the camels and the sand I love you. I love you, too. Oh, excuse me Hey, I know you. I've seen you at the coffee shop on Columbus. You know, I keep meaning to introduce myself. I am Chris. Will. Hi. Where are you off to? France. Going on this bike tour through the Loire valley.

I couldn't stand him I'm sorry to hear that I was hoping you would fall in love - Oh, I did - Tell me Grace, I found the perfect pair of jeans I'm serious. They're perfect They conceal from the world everything which is flawed and evil and show only that which is true and plump I've spent my entire life looking for a bra that'll do that How 'bout you?

Hmm Welcome home, Will How 'bout the fact that since you last saw me I have fathered a 12-year-old boy Yeah While you were out of the country discovering the gay jean I was here raising my son Would it have killed you to acknowledge that the boy exists or were you too busy high-kicking it with Nicky Kidman at the Moulin Rouge?

It is Zandra with a "Z," not Sondra with an "S," 'cause Sondra with an "S" goes "sss" not "zzz." A student once made the mistake of calling her Sondra and she threw a lit cigarette at him Don't you mean Zigarette? Look, kiddies, I'm being pummeled by my allergies, my back is in knots and I`ve got an underwire sticking right here in my left one So I am in no mood for B.S.

Food - What kind? - An egg salad sandwich - You liar! - Ok, it was tuna! Poor guy He's not very in touch with his instrument Oh, but he is He can even dial a phone with it honey, you scared me I thought you were my clone but none of them survived Hey, Kar Hey, aren't you supposed to be at work, 'cause I know I am Oh, how am I supposed to leave you? I mean, look at you You're a wreck Oh, well, actually, honey I'm feeling much better Yeah, I just talked to Stan He had a good day in prison today He and a convicted junk bond trader smuggled a glazed ham out of the kitchen So, honey, if you want to leave I know you've got things to do I mean, there's fashion mistakes to be made andit's probably happy hour at some gay bar Oh, and also You know what? I'm not gonna leave you Not this apartment or this tub until I know that you are totally whole But. Not another word You know what? I'm getting a little chill so could you close the door, please? From the other side How sorry am I? "S" is for how very sad you make me feel "O" is for, oh how very bad you make me feel "R" is for how wrong you make me feel And the other "R" is for how rotten you are Get off Get off the stage! I don't want to even look at you anymore Sorry, Zandra I don't even believe that Ok, new person you're up Oh, I'm just observing Life isn't there for us to observe It's there for us to live - Oh, really, I-Oh, but - Up! The thing is, when there's a camera on me I just get-- Oy, boy Uh, I--I can't Do it now Go Hi I haven't done a lot of acting before Actually, that's not true I--I-- For 19 years I played the role of a heterosexual My guess is not very convincingly Now apologize to someone you've wronged Ok, let's see uh I'm sorry Someone that you've treated unfairly Just think about the pain you've caused and tell that person you're sorry I'm sorry. I'm sorry I've been so hard on you I'm sorry I expect so much from you Who are you talking to? Myself It's just that I make you feel that you have to be so perfect for everybody else I set you up for failure No wonder you're afraid Please forgive me, I beg of you please, forgive me. I love you I love you Will Truman, I love you! I want to work with you privately I don't know what to do I mean, Grace is my friend and it's not that I don't appreciate what she's done but enough is enough I know, mommy She's driving me up a wall She sleeps late She's insulting to the staff She's turning into one of those mean abusive rich people She should be punched in the neck hey That's not very lady-like - With an open fist - There's my girl What are we gonna do? Wait a minute I've got an idea We'll come up with a big fancy plan with lots of twists and turns to make her understand what she's done I'll hide somewhere and you'll wear big shoes Or we could go simpler Thanks, honey! You're a good friend! "And I have to believe if there's any justice in this world "Stanley Walker will soon be a free man." I'm so real "Stanley Walker will soon be a free man." Every time I watch it I find a new layer - Wanna watch it again? - No. Turn it off - Hand me that blanket - You get it You know, if we were at Karen's right now there would be somebody to do this for me This place is a dump.

She can scrub the hurt and anger out of Grace's knits and fine washables Finally, you're here! You know, if you're gonna leave me in the limo for five hours the least you could do is crack a window What, and let you start yapping out at all the other maids so that they can come over and jump on the car?

You're right I've deluded myself this whole time into thinking that I'm ok, but the truth is I haven't been able to have a good relationship since Michael Maybe you're right to stay in bed and deal with it. I mean Maybe I'm the one who got out of bed too early Honey You were right I don't know when Stan's coming back I mean, for all I know it could be years I gotta stop lying to myself, Grace I'm really lonely I I miss him When you said I'm an actor-singer who jumps from one relationship to another it made me realize You didn't say dancer And I've always felt in my heart that the dance is my strong point That's so depressing This is me doing a split jump on the trampoline.

You know, that new show by the acclaimed screenwriter Alan Ball? Tehh ball (º¼Àº ¼Ó¾î·Î °íÈ¯À» ÁöÄª) The corpse is like, in three scenes and it's the glue that holds the whole story together Well, for what it's worth I've seen you act and I feel totally confident that you have the emotional range to play a dead man Thank you Pssst! I'm enjoying your blouse today You know, Sarah Michelle Gellar is really smart I mean, at the beginning of this interview she's just talkin' about stuff like where she gets her highlights but then she starts in on foreign affairs and campaign finance reform I'm gonna say it She's a genius Let me see that Hmm Interesting Yeah. See? these pages are stuck together You've been reading an interview with John McCain (Á¸ ¸ÆÄÉÀÎ : ¹Ì »ó¿øÀÇ¿ø) Here's the rest of Sarah Michelle "And even after all these years limos are way cool."

He's gay - And? - And he's gay But what's he for? I mean, you know, where does he stand on the issues? What do you care? You thought Buffy was in a prisoner of war camp (¹öÇÇ : »ç ó ¹Ì¼Ð °Ö·¯ÀÇ ±Ø Áß ÀÌ¸§) I'm just wondering what are his positions? I don't know I think he's a top Come on Write a check already You should support gay men Gay men support you How much? The limit's 500 Most people are giving, like, 250 Heh!

Watch this Wow I feel like I'm looking through the eyes of every one of your lovers Thank you Anyway, Elliot doesn't want me to invite Karen He doesn't like her Can you believe it? Kids today are so weird You know, when I was a kid we couldn't wait to hang out with the local insensitive drunk I run this by Karen, and it turns out she does not care for Elliot either Why? He's polite. He's sweet. He's kind I think I just answered my own question I mean, what am I supposed to do? What--? Ok, I know. I know I got it. I got it I'm gonna stage a phony robbery Yeah. I'm gonna tie 'em back-to-back in chairs until they're forced to get along and I'm gonna wear a stocking on my head Taupe Or maybe eggplant Doesn't matter, doesn't matter It doesn't matter. I can decide later That's the fun part Why don't you just sit them down and talk it out? Uh-huh. Uh-huh That could work, although Where do the panty-hose come in? You can always just wear them under your slacks You are always one step ahead of me I hate that about you! And I love that about you! Hey, Mrs. Friedman how are things on the eighth floor? I'm not talking to you, Grace Adler and you should be ashamed of yourself I swear, the elevator smelled like this before I got on I'm not talking about that I'm talking about your button I can't believe you're supporting that man Ted Bowers happens to be an excellent candidate Ptewey! Your candidate sucks my rain boots Hey, I like Ted Bowers and he's gay and I think it's high time we had gay representation on the city council especially in a society that still undervalues the rights of gay people Fine. Do what you want Me, I'm voting for the Jewish woman There's a Jewish woman running? Rosario, where the hell are you? Get your rump into the rumpus room and get rid of all this junk Lady, I told you the doctor said I shouldn't lift anything I've pulled a muscle Oh, honey, I'm sorry I keep forgetting you're laid up Can I get you anything? Wellactually I could use a bowl of sou-- Hey, Kare what you doin' in the play room? Oh. Hi, honey Since Stan's in the clink and the stepkids are spendin' most of their time with first wife I decided to turn it into something useful you know, like a laboratory or an Indian casino Oh, wow, you got an X-Box! Hey, hey, hey! Just because my husband's in prison does not mean you can talk dirty to me What the hell is he doin' here anyway? He is here because I cannot tolerate two of the most important people in my life not getting along Now, I will not have my family go the way of other showbiz families So the three of us are gonna stay in this room until you two can find a love for each other and nobody, but nobody is leaving until we get this done! Oh, my God! My corpse audition just got moved up! I gotta run Listen, you two work it out - Remember, find the love! - Hey! Wh--! Honey, I--! Uh So, listen, I need a check What for? Judy Green She's running for city council and I think we should support her But we're backing Ted Bowers Well, I found out a few things about him that makes me think I should support the other candidate Like what? Like he's running against a woman So? Who is she? What do we know about her? She's a woman - And? - And she's Jewish - And? - And she's a woman So what? What are her positions? I don't know. She's Jewish She probably just lays there Come on Write the check! I am not gonna write you a check That would just cancel out the check you wrote me I know That's why I've already stopped payment on mine Now, come on Make it payable to "Judy Green for City Council." All right Is a zillion dollars enough? Come on! Women need a voice on the city council I mean, 50% of the population is women So, one could argue that They just don't know it yet Anyway, this is not about statistics This is about who has the better candidate Well, what makes you think that you have the better candidate? Grace, he's gay Well, mine's a woman and Jewish That makes two victims to your one Since when are you so Jewish anyway? You're about as Jewish as Melanie Griffith in A Stranger Among Us Well, you're about as gay as Tom Sellick in In and Out I am plenty gay When was the last time you had same-sex sex? I'm choosy! Ha! You're straight! Go watch a basketball game! Yeah? Well, you're barely a woman You pee standing up! Hey! There are a lot of diseases you can get from a toilet seat!! Our own?! Well, I never thought that I would hear this from you! - You hate women! - Well, you hate gays! - My room - Whatever - Hey - Hi I'm sorry I said some harsh things before You know, like "you're not a woman." My God, look at you you're all woman You're gorgeous you're hot, you're sexy When I look at you all I can think about is being with that Croatian guy from "ER." Aw, sweetie You know, I said some pretty harsh things, too You are plenty gay If you were any gayer you'd be Elton John's fanny pack You don't have to say that No, I mean it Well, if I implied that you're anything less than a big Jew, I'm sorry Thank you Let's just agree to disagree support our candidates and just not make a big thing of it Agreed I knew you'd feel that way Which is why I know you'll have no problem with me having a little Ted Bowers neighborhood fund-raiser here? Not at all In fact, I've already agreed to host a Judy Green fund-raiser here, too - Huh! - Huh When's yours? Tonight Change it No! Stop it! You stop! Ok, so I guess we're supposed to talk about what bugs us about each other Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Ok, I'll go first Hmm. Kinda pushy for a 5-year-old, aren't ya? I'm 12 Huh. So you lie about your age so that you can drink or? This is what it is about you you're weird You're a weird woman And you kinda look like the demon who guards the tomb in "Tomb Raider." Don't even try and flatter me, kid Ok, look, I'm not happy about this, either but Jack asked us to do it and he's important to both of us so I think we should at least try Ok, oh! This is what really bugs me about you the way you talk You're honest you've got no agenda you're not manipulative It's like you're talkin' in code! Ok, well, how do you want me to talk? Oh, honey, I don't care Just quit bein' such a goody two shoes - I am not a goody two shoes - Oh, yeah? Don't drink, don't smoke what do ya do? I am bad I'm bad news Come on, two shoes!

Let's get going and let's try to keep the eating to a minimum not spoil our appetites by gorging on everybody else's turkey and stuffing and pecan pie Why do you look at me when you say that? Who should I be looking at? Me Ok, I figure we each get one hour We'll set this timer and when it goes off We're out of there no matter what We do not respond to guilt shame, tears, or flattery Why do you look at me when you say that? Who should I be looking at? Me So, listen for the ding That loud, piercing high-pitched sound Why do you look at me when you say that? We respond only to the ding because only the ding will set us free Understand? Let's try it Well, this piece fell off already But if I get this knife this piece will come right off Ok. Karen one hour I don't mean to rush you but if we're gonna get back in time for dinner we've all got to stick to the plan You gays and your discipline No wonder you all end up in the clergy Ok, Kar Let's go Oh, no.

Rental-car-stranger water! Oh, my God! How do I know this was water? You know when boys go on road trips they don't make pee-stops They just use a water bottle Oh, my God! Grace, don't you think you would've noticed if you were drinking pee? There's still 40 minutes left on the timer What happened? Oh, we were done There's really not much left to say after your husband tells you he wants you to start sleeping with other people That's intense I did it again! He must be kidding What exactly did Stan say? He said he wasn't sure how long he was gonna be in there and it wasn't fair to ask me to wait for him He wants me to be sexually satisfied while he's in prison I don't know why He certainly didn't care while he was out Maybe it's.. It's not called cheating if you have permission Yeah, maybe it's just called fantastic Well, it doesn't matter Even if, at this very moment his cellmate is tattooing "Property of Javier" on Stan's fat wide ass with a hot ballpoint I'm a one-man woman! Woman? I think you mean "lady." Ok, listen We're getting close to Aunt Honey's so I need to brief you Whatever you do do not tell my mother that Nathan and I broke up You haven't told her? You see how I went up at the end, like I cared? Look, she always said that I was wasting my time with him and there's nothing she loves more than saying "I told you so." She's so obnoxious She even has a little told-you-so dance Grace, you have an I-told-you-so dance Yeah, well but mine's cute Everyone thinks so Who's everyone? Shouldn't you be looking for a parking space? The only good news is that my mother's still depressed about not getting that part in Queen Lear so there's a chance she won't sing Am I blue? Are these tears in my eyes tellin' you? We'll back out real slow-like I don't think we've been spotted - Look who it is! - Oh, hey! - My Gracala. Come here - Aunt Honey!

Yep You can laugh at "stake it" now but when it becomes my "dyn-o-mite" or my "leggo my eggo" or my "hey, hey, hey" Then you'll be laughing,because Wait. What Who's that guy? That guy?

So I went up to her and I said I said "Excuse me I don't mind you using stake it but you do know that it's my catch phrase" And she said she's been saying "stake it" for years that her sister's ex-boyfriend invented "stake it" in Chicago in 1994 while working in a plastic factory! But how can that be? Ok, Jack I don't know what to say I'm outraged We are not gonna let her get away with this We are gonna slap such a lawsuit on her she won't know what hit her yeah, Thanks, Will Yeah either that or I'll pants you in public Let's go with that Hey, Curt, it's, uh it's me Will again I'm just calling again to, uh, to tell you what a great time I had the other night again Uh, still love to hear from you You got my home number my office, my pager, my cell Uh, I guess that's it Although my CB handle is Big Willie Oh, crap!

Grace is cooking us pot roast tonight Ok, back up I know nothing of dinner with Grace You don't even know who Grace is, and you certainly don't want her pot roast It's like tire tread without the flavor Well, I called looking for you, she picked up and invited me over for dinner -Is that a problem? -Yes! Eh, uh, no It's just, like I thought we were doin' the bean thing, you know? We're growing it in a small cup? Yeah I never really understood what that was about I mean, God, what is it?

Hunchback? Does he have fins? I guess I was just afraid of what you might think And then I thought, I like him, you're gonna like him And even if you don't like him, it doesn't matter 'cause I like him Good 'Cause I was starting to think that maybe you were embarrassed by him or something No What would I have to be embarrassed about? Hey, Will One second All I'm asking is that you don't judge I don't judge 'Cause the temptation will be to jump to conclusions Will, open the door Robert, this is Grace Sorry I'm doing The Nutcracker, and-- Oh! You're a dancer What the hell is that supposed to mean?! He bends over any farther, there'll be chestnuts roastin' on an open fire - What's he doing? - He's stretching, Grace What kind of a question is that? What does it look like he's doing? He looks like he's doing something that would render you unnecessary Oh, relax I like him Well, good I like him, too You like him I like him Everybody likes him Would you please knock off that stretching, Robert You're freaking Grace out Oh, sorry I didn't mean to make you guys uncomfortable You didn't If anything I'm jealous If I could do that, it would render a date unnecessary Oh! Ha ha ha! How embarrassing for you So I repeated the joke When you discovered "Hold me closer, Tony Danza," you rode that till the wheels fell off Grace, you look like you'd be a good dancer Oh Oh Heh heh! Oh, no I am not blessed with the dance Oh, come on What are you talking about? Everybody's a dancer Every movement we make is a dance We just have to find it Huh Oy Now, take a simple action, like clearing the table See? You can find the dance in everything, even clearing a dish Wow Well, maybe next you can find the dance in doing my laundry Oh ho ho! No one thinks you're funny You know, Will and I have a dance You do? - No, we don't - Yes, we do! Get your cute little butt over here, and let's show Grace the dance I taught you I really don't want to-- No, you have to I have to see it now Come on You're doing it, mister And five, six, seven, eight Ok, that's fine That's good We're done finding the dance We'll look in the morning when there's more light We may even find your sleeves - That was so-- - I said don't Ok Heh! Will, I gotta go I guess I'll see you later Grace, it was great to meet you It was so great meeting you, Robert I'll walk you out Ok You just couldn't help yourself, could you? What?! I already admitted I was a bad dancer! You had to pick him apart! You had to ruin it for me! What? What are you talking about? How did I ruin it? The minute he walked in the door, you were all like, "Oh, he's a dancer" He is a dancer I didn't know he was a dancer When I found out he was a dancer, I said, "Oh, you're a dancer" You didn't say, "Oh, you're a dancer" You said--you said, "Oh, you're a dancer" There's no difference Yes, there is! One of them is riddled with judgment And you know very well, the minute one of us judges the other person's new person, it's over It's a sick fact, but it's true "Oh, you're a dancer" "Oh, you're a dancer" I see no difference Every time I look at him, I'll see your face hovering above, going, "Oh, he's a dancer" He is a dancer Oh, wow! Now you are just throwing it in my face! Will, I liked him Maybe you're the one who has a problem with him Is that possible Hecter Projector? Don't you try turning this back on me when I am right in the middle of turning it on you You have never been more wrong, and to prove it to you, I'm going to keep seeing Robert I may even fall in love with him We'll move in together We'll have kids And through it all, Grace We will have the dance This better be important, Jack I was on the roof chain-smoking Ok, Dorleen, you know how you said you wanted something edgy? Well, hold on to your yellow teeth because here it is The theme to my Barney's Christmas window is Somebody's been naughty Dorleen, this is Santa's ho ho ho What? It's fabulous, right? Oh, wait! And for reindeer, we're gonna have eight little buff men in boxer briefs on all fours with antlers Can you see it? Can you see it? Do you bit!

The Bartender's Bible? Forget it All right, honey I can't change your mind, I can see that, but, uh, we're still friends, right? Come on Let's shake on it What is this? Karen, keep your money Jack's on his own What are the holidays comin' to when you can't even bribe a friend to help a friend who screwed that friend over? Santa, it's Jackie First of all, I just wanna say I'm sorry about the time when I was 11 and told Timmy Woods that you didn't exist I was just tryin' to make him cry so I could hug him But now I really need your help This Barney's window, it It's a disaster I guess I deserve it for screwin' my friend over But I'm really scared I'm gonna lose my job, so, Santa, if you help me, I promise I'll never ask for anything ever, ever, ever again, ever Amen Love Jack PS, um I know I just said that thing about never asking for anything ever, ever again, but, um, if you're feeling generous, I would like some leather pants, umhair extensions, and the ability to fly Heh heh! Ok, donkey boy, it's your turn Let's see your window Um, uh, you know, wouldn't it be better to keep it covered up for a while? I mean, very mysterioso, very curioso, very Rene Russo No But I need more time, please? Please?! Quit begging you're acting like a homeless person If you don't shut up, I'll throw my hot coffee on you, too Babs, open window five So, did Grace say anything about me?

It's magnificent Well, maybe the next time you'll be more willing to ask for some help I did ask for help No, you didn't Yes, I did I got down on my knees and everything I mean, I didn't even think there was a Santa, but Santa? You think Santa did this? Well, I don't know how else to explain it Do you? Nope Must be Santa Listen, do me a favor You're the only one who knows about this, so if anyone asks, just tell them I did it, ok? I promise Hey Hey! Where's Robert? He's gone He had to go Thought that might happen Looks like it's just you and me for Christmas this year Well, we could invite some friends over Grace, we can't sit around in our underwear and cry in front of friends Why not? We did last year That is one spectacular window, Grace Thanks Jack thinks Santa did it That's my boy

Ok, then Time to see if this stud horse is worth what you paid for him Come on now, Lamar Now, Lamar, when you get out there take your time You're not in a hurry You don't care That's how I'd play it, at least Although I'd probably wear pants No, I wouldn't!

He'll say whatever you want to hear just so he can get what he wants He doesn't care who gets hurt because he doesn't love anyone but himself! Whoa, whoa, whoa Ok, stop No, he--he may be some of those things some of the time but let me tell you my dad-- When I was little and I got sick he would sit by my bedside the entire night to make sure the washcloth on my forehead stayed cool He got up every morning at 5:30 just to have juice with me before I went on my paper route And at 19 when I told dad I was gay he-- Well, he drove into a telephone pole, but That night he hugged me and said "you're my son." That's all I know The man may have his faults but not being able to love isn't one of them You're right, Will George Truman is magnificent What? Uh--uh-- But remember, he's mean Go ahead Tina?

Hide me Everybody's about to find out I'm not a professional tennis player Big deal Because of my speech Sarah's decided not to marry Danny So what, your stand-up's now so bad it's breaking up marriages? Why don't you keep your opinion to yourself, Venus? Now get out of here I gotta convince her to marry him Ok, is there a window in here? Does it smell like there's a window in here? Oh, now, Grace-- There you are silly, he's here Steve! Yeah, you know what? You know when I said I was a professional tennis player that was because You know how you throw the word "professional" around like like Heather Graham is a "professional" actress?

I'll call you, or not Oh, my God, you're back! How did you get his mom to agree to this? I didn't I've been kidnapped Whoops! Come on, Sarah you're about to make the most amazing commitment The only thing I've committed to lately is buying seven more CDs over the next 12 months and even that's giving me a stomachache Yeah, but all that stuff you said about Danny is true He's childish he's immature, he's-- I know, but he's a lot of other things, too He's a good guy He's a really good guy Yes, he may not go too deep into things But maybe that's ok because he let's me be the crazy one We can be in this huge crowd and he makes me feel like I am the only one there And there was this one time where I cut my hair really short I looked like the guy in Simply Red And I feltso bad And he came home and he said "I don't care You look beautiful, no matter what." That was so sweet Daytime TV sucks Uh, what's going on? Why aren't you at school why you with him and why haven't you turned into a bat? I had nothing to do with this Elliot, Karen, I believe you have something you want to say to Bonnie Um, I got out of school early and went over to Jack's Elliot, how? I signed him out I'm sorry, young lady you're gonna have to speak up I signed him out! You kidnapped my kid? It was his idea! You drove! Yeah, well, you're the one who wanted to see Jack! Well, you're the one who bribed the attendance lady! - Nya-nya-nya! - Nya-nya-nya! All right, stop it stop it, both of you! Karen, so help me God I am two seconds away from not giving you a spanking Elliot, what were you thinking? I wanted to see him I missed him, mom Go to your room Not you, him! Go Good, that kid is trouble And you, go to your limo and think about what you've done - But-- - Limo! Ohh! Now, Jack, don't you remember a conversation we had where I said I didn't want you to see my kid or was the soundtrack of Evita blaring too loud in your head? Hey, I wasn't part of any of this, ok? They came to me, and the first thing I did was bring Elliot back here Are you wearing blush? Ok, the second thing I did - was bring Elliot back here - Good The point is he's here and you'll never have to see me again so I'm just gonna take my gay self back to my gay apartment live my gay life and have a gay old time What are you doing what is that? Oh, come on The whole thing about the gay haircut I know what's going on here The reason you reacted so strongly about the hair is because you have a problem with gay people - No, I don't - Yes, you do - No, I don't - Yes, you do! - I'm gay, Jack - No, you're not! - Yes, I am - No, you're not!

It's charming, right? I love it! Are we done? Well, I like the space great floors It's equidistant from my gym and Krispy Kreme does it have a view? Does it have a view?!

What?! Who?! Well, I've been working my way through your checkbook trying to figure out who you are by how you spend Who is she? Oh Well, honey, I think that's somebody driver ran over But usually, when Driver runs somebody over there's a little frowny face in the memo part of the check Yeah, well maybe it was one of those double-pedestrian dealios Who cares? Listen I gotta go see a man about a horse pill! Lois Whitley I don't think we've heard the last of her Come with us now as we begin to unravel the mystery of Karen Walker Come on Keep 'em closed One step we really don't want to play this game anymore Last time we did this I stepped on the owner And open!

We came here to film you Film me? Oh, honey, I haven't done those kind of movies in 30 years Just give me a few minutes to freshen up Oh, no It's not that at all I'm doing a film tribute to a friend of mine and I come here today with my crew Hi To ask you a few questions about said friend Roll it So, Lois Whitley tell us What exactly is your relationship to one Ms Karen Walker? I'm her mother Santa Maria it has a mother?! I wish I'd never seen that place Now I can't stop thinking about it It was so great Not like this dump Come on This place is fine Oh, it's a dump, Will! This is a beautiful apartment People would kill for a place like this It's got a doorman, a terrace It's in a great neighbor hood Damn it! What idiot builds a step up to a kitchen?! This place sucks! Crappy design! Well, you'd better get used to it 'cause we're stuck in a shoebox until I'm an old maid in a threadbare cardigan and you're an old maid in a threadbare caftan Thanks You know the worst part about this apartment? Oh my God! You're not gonna believe what happened! Honest to God I was not gonna say that I met Karen's mother She's not dead She's a cocktail waitress It turns out Karen's father died when she was seven. Oh, my God Can you imagine what Karen looked like when she was seven years old? Cute little pumps, cute little martini cute little pills Anyway, from then on they moved around a lot until Lois met a man a ne'er-do-well named Bernie Or was it Todd? I don't know I can't remember 'cause at that point I zoned out 'cause some real hot fireman came into the bar Oh, his name was Todd That's right Hot Toddy Anyway, what did I do with his number? Actually , when Karen was 16 her and her mother had some big falling-out and Lois wouldn't tell me what it was but I have a feeling Karen killed a man with her bare breasts All this is in my movie I smell sequel Karen has a mother? Yeah, that's huge So, we've got to figure out how to get that apartment It's too much money Perhaps But not if we have more money My God, Grace You've done it That apartment is as good as ours - Oh, wait! - What? - No / Uh? - Well / Yeah? There is one thing we could do but it might make us bad people So let me ask you would you rather be good people in a bad apartment or bad people in a great apartment? I think you know the answer to that We sublet We find somebody else to take this place Then we charge a lot more money than we should We gouge 'em! You are brilliant! Guys, open up! Ellen has to pee - Hey - Hi Sorry we're late Traffic was ridiculous Well, maybe if you had taken the tunnel like I told you to instead of taking us on a scenic tour of murderville we could've been here on time! I'm irritable, I'm fat and I have to pee Wow I forgot Ellen stopped coloring her hair Is it weird that she's not a redhead anymore? Yeah, yeah It's weird she's not a lot of things anymore Red-headed, fun, nice I just don't think she likes me anymore, guys Come on Why do you say that?

It was time to move on Karen, that's shocking You drank milk? The last town we lived in I fell in love with a boy He had long blond hair delicate features, soft skin At least I think it was a boy Well, anyway, I was in love And he or she loved me Until my mom scammed her, too Then he left me That was when I left home and never looked back Karen, this isn't something you can runaway from It's not like a hotel bill or a crying baby Forget it, Jack There are some things you just can't forgive Wait I can't let you do this Look, when I found my father it was too late to connect with him because he was dead And I don't want the same thing to happen to you So please just go in and have one drink with her, ok?

This is about how you ruined everything for me as a kid Oh, come on, Keeks We had good times Remember the summer we went to Lake George? Yeah, I remember I had to stay wrapped up in a blanket from head to toe cause you told everybody at the country club I was allergic to the sun and if we didn't raise $10,000 for my operation I'd have to live under the stairs for the rest of my life And we fished You used me, Mom I was never anything more than a prop to you The poor little blind girl with the big rack Or the poor little welfare child with the big rack Or the poor little gardener's daughter With the big rake It hurt me, Mom I wanted a mother not a business partner Oh, Kiki I am so sorry Maybe I wasn't winning any mother of the year awards then, but, you know we're different people now but we're still family I still love you I see So you reappear after all this time say you're sorry and I'm supposed to forgive you, just like that?

Well, I thought I was gonna be sad you know, going back to the house dealing with the reality of their separation but you know what? It actually turned out to be fairly devastating - Oh, I'm sorry - Yeah they've put the house on the market so they told us kids just to take anything that really means something to us Boy, I can't imagine doing that in my parent's house Mainly because I've already stolen everything I liked and everything else is crap Well, I had to fight for it but I got something I love Oh, good Well, hopefully it Will be a reminder of all the good times that you and your family Aah! What the hell is that freaky thing?! His name's Squatsie When I was 9, my brothers and I all chipped in and got him for my parent's anniversary Even though he wasn't really their taste they loved us so much they put him right in the front garden where everybody could see him Oh, that's sweet Do you think it'll fit down the chute or should we just take it to the dumpster? Ok, I knew when I brought a gnome into this house that some would scoff but I love him! We have been through a lot together Haven't we, Squatsie? Right you are, Will You've always had a special place in me heart! Oh, good He talks, too And I think I see the perfect place for him Huh? what do you think, Squats? Oh, I like it here, Will Um, may I offer one Squatsie-related thought? Um, he strikes me as an outdoor gnome I mean, 'cause, look he's already wearing a jacket Why don't we keep him in our garden? What? That community garden plot across the street? I thought we got rid of that two years ago Eh, there was this big form you had to fill out It was less work just to pay the bill Once again your sloth pays off You know, this is a great idea I used to sit in the garden and look at my gnome and look at the flowers sing songs Thinking about falling in love some day I even used to make wishes on him Did you wish to be gay? Because that one really came true Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º (Went To A Garden Potty) ÀÚ¸· Á¦ÀÛ - ³×ÀÌÆ® µå ó¸  24 ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Will & Grace ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ And, Karen, you know I wouldn't be asking for your help if I didn't feel we were like family I mean, God all we've been through Oh, I know, honey You don't have to remind me Well, you know our history together-- Those summers we spent in Sag Harbor you and Stan me and Lorraine Oh, Lorraine.

Norman Norman, right Listen, honey, since it means something to Stan I'll throw a few shekels your way What kind of commercial are we talking?

Wow Well, our sun-dried tomatoes came in I guess it's funny that you killed everything Ok I may have gone a little overboard but I figure we can afford it because of all the money we're gonna save growing our own food Well, you don't eat vegetables so unless we can grow a Ring-Ding bush I really don't see that happening Come on. Dig in I want to make it pretty for Squatsie Yeah, let's get in there and start making things grow But I'm gonna do it from over here because I don't want to get my new gardening clothes dirty Grace, come here, you wuss Get your fingers in the earth Connect with nature It's almost spiritual, really Aah!

What are you doing? Excuse me, we're talking! I hear all of Will's ties are made out of boogers I hear he got a boredom woody during study hall Oh, I get it You're bitchy school girls trying to snub me If only there was some way I could turn my pain into grim determination and become a wildly successful lawyer while the two bitchy girls grow up to become two bitchy women Someone's got a big vocabulary and a little dictionary Just give me a signature The sooner you get that over with the sooner you two Heathers can get back to your heathering Hey!

We'll do it another time Oh, but honey, I'm dying to find out about Diane and Mark It is so great At one point in the argument I mean, you're totally on Diane's side And then it turns, and you find yourself completely sympathizing with Mark It's exactly the way I felt about the Meg Ryan/Dennis Quaid relationship God, are you guys still talking about that stupid book? I swear, the way you go on about it you'd think it had pictures of naked men frolicking Does it?

Move your bunny slippers I'm trying to work on my presentation Not really my problem I'm trying to take care of my needs here, all right? Just a little something I learned in gay group therapy Jack, inviting three hot guys over to your apartment for a "four-gy" does not qualify as group therapy I'm talking about actual therapy You know, at first I thought group would be a great way to meet guys You know I love me some crazies But as it turns out I actually have a problem Would you like to know what it is? / Get out I'm too much of a giver That's right I give a little bit too much Always putting other people's needs before mine Well, no more! Before it used to be World, Jack Now it's Jack, World Hey, Jack world how about you move your Jack feet before I kick your Jack ass? Wow, you are toxic I think you need a little gay group therapy - Oh, hey, poodle - Hi, Kare I'd love to stay and fondle but Grace's mood ring is a filthy brown today Ok - One for the road? - Ok..

Get rid of her - Ok So, um, listen, Val I was just-- just bringing you your phone bill - 'cause they put it in my box - Ok, don't come any closer! The clump of hair that you ripped outis just starting to grow back in Oh, come on, silly I'm not like that anymore You are looking at a totally new me / Why? You finally working as a team with the people in your head? Well, kind of Actually, I'm on this amazing new psychotropic drug I mean, sure, I have no sex drive and I'm always dizzy but I think I could be a really good friend Here So what are you working on there, G-Dog? Um, it's a meditation room for this client I'm trying to land Wow That's nifty I'd sure love a room like that I'm surprised the court hasn't ordered you to be in a room like that Very funny! Tickle-tickle-tickle-tickle! You're ticklish See? You know what? I miss this! I miss this so much Well, now, see here's the deal We could have this-- If you were not this-- All right Hey, can I take this? 'Cause some day you're gonna be really famous and I can say that I knew you when Sure, but you know, Val I really do need to get back to work Oh, sure I just wanted to come and let you know that I'm doing a lot better Is that your urine or mine? I confess When I first started gay group therapy I just thought it was a really great place to meet guys But now as I look around the room and I see you all looking back at me I realize it's not such a great place to meet guys Gavin the last time you shared you spoke about how your fear of rejection often leads you to make up elaborate stories in order to spend time with the men you find attractive How's that going? Well, I'm doing it again you know, and it's killing me I--I met this really good-looking guy today at this coffee shop and instead of asking him out I offered to help him find his stolen laptop Go on, Gavin Well, I don't know why I'm so shy with men You know, maybe it's because I came out so late in my life but, you know why can't I just say, you know "Hi, I'm Gavin You want a cup of coffee?" "A chocolate chip muffin?" Nah, I'm a mess Maybe a cookie will cheer you up, huh? Want a little cookie? Hmm? You know, I prefer the minis The cream-to-cookie ratio is just so much better for me You know? You got something in your teeth Whatever No, really Just stop it This really freaks me out I got--I got a thing about this, ok? So-- - Seriously? This freaks you out? - Stop this now, all right? Just stop it! I told-- Stop!Doctor-- Jack! You know Gavin has problems with food in teeth Now kindly respect that Sorry, Gavin Weirdo Gavin, what do you think your next move should be with this guy? Well, I like the guy You know, I want to go out with him and I think I should be totally honest I think I should stop all these stories and just tell him the truth A gay laptop-theft ring? You gotta be kidding me! No, I'm afraid so It looks like you're the latest victim Why would they want gay people's computers? Well, for one thing you know, they're organized very neat desktops usually have a carrying case You can dress it up or dress it down Anyway, that's not the point I thought we could do some surveillance We? Well, you said you wanted to get involved Yeah No, I'd love to I love police business You have terrific teeth-- Really clean Uh, let's go undercover Say, Saturday, eight-ish? Great Undercover, wow Hey, do I get to wear a wire? Will we be in dark alleys with really wet streets? I'm not afraid I'm just thinking about footwear I'm actually thinking of this hot gay club on 14th Street You know, obvious target Lots of laptop users there A club? You really think we're gonna find the perps there? "Perps." That's very cute And I think the meditation room will end up being your favorite room in the house Oh, every room is my favorite now that my wife has left me Well, let me paint a picture Imagine yourself in an oasis of calm A place where the world shuts down and the noise stops Yes Exactly Your cares melt away as you step onto the heated stone floor Mmm, a warmth envelops you from within You lose yourself as you listen to the soothing trickle of the Japanese rock fountain Oh which mingles harmoniously with the soothing trickle of the morphine drip Around you cabinets full of pills await your every mood Your turn Medi-ta-tion room not medi-ca-tion room You say "potato" Anyway, I hope you're getting a sense of what I'm trying to do Yeah, yeah, it's great I'd go with it right now but I promised another designer that I would hear her ideas, too Maybe you know her? She works right next door Next door? When did a designer move into the-- Hey, neighbs Vince? Whenever you're ready and I have a great idea for a meditation room Who's crazy now, huh, Grace? You you you you you you you you! I hate her I hate Val I'm the kind of person who doesn't hate anyone! - You hate your sister - Well, she's hateful! But besides her I don't hate anyone - You hate your doorman - Well, he calls me "kiddo" and clicks Besides my doorman and my sister I don't hate anyone - You hate Teri Hatcher - Oh, who doesn't?! (Å×¸® ÇØÃ³:Desperate HousewivesÀÇ ÁÖÀÎ°ø) Ok, fine! So I hate a lot of people but I hate Val more! She stole my ideas, then she has the audacity to come in here and ask to see my carpet samples?! Oh, she was hitting on you?! No to use in her presentation and I told her no way is she borrowing my stuff Over my dead body! I think there's somebody back there stealing stuff! - I'm gonna hit her so hard!! - Honey, no! Just one in the face It's the only thing she responds to No, no, no Now come on. Come on Come on. Come on Now listen to me! If there's anything I've learned from studying the ancient Chinese art of t'ai chi it's that if you do it in the morning a couple hours later you're gonna want to do it again You know what I'm talking about? But if there's another thing I learned is that violence is never the answer You're right of course, of course you're right Oh ho! Come on, come on now! Now, the important thing is to blend in Remember we are two gay laptop users on a date - It's only a matter of time - All right Should I be wearing a bullet-proof vest? Or, considering this is a gay bar a bullet-proof leather vest? No, you look fine, Will You're doing the right thing If we had more people like you we'd get some of that scum off the streets Now, look at me like you love me What? Oh! Oh, I see Because the-- Right Ok, um how's this? I'm sorry It's just-- you--you looked like you were buying it Did I? You know I'm kinda surprised that anybody would bring their laptop to a bar - Hold my hand - Sure You know, but I guess gay people are more likely to come straight from the office with their laptops have a few drinks and that's when it happens That's a good observation You'd make a hell of a cop-- Perceptive, intelligent You got a set of eyes like two inviting pools of chocolate pudding Well, we look for that on the force Love this song Got a good beat I guess that would make us "good beat" cops You wanna dance? Oh! Oh, so that way we leave the laptops unattended Yeah, sure Whatever Hey, that guy looks suspicious He's in a gay bar eating a hot dog without any irony You stay right where you are I'm gonna try to get a better view Oh, yeah I can see a lot better from back here I want my baby back baby back, baby back I want my baby back baby back, baby back. I want-- Oh, hey, honey - How you doing? - Great I took all my anger towards Val and I put it entirely into my work Well, maybe not entirely I did make a crank call to Teri Hatcher That's so funny, Vince! - Hi, Grace - Hey, G-Love Listen, I ran into Val in the lobby and she had an interesting idea to combine both of your presentations into the same meeting What do you think, huh? Well, um, you know I'm not really one to combine things I mean, I can't even eat my peas if they're touching the meat especially if the meat is crazy But--but if it will save you time then let's do it Yeah, let's do it 'Cause this woman has more talent in her little-boy breasts than you have in your whole body Ok, I have some sketches here for the living room I have some sketches, too, Vince but unfortunately they're up here in the ol' kanoodle Ok Why don't we now hear some ideas for the bedroom? Ok. Well, first of all I think what we need to do in here is to-- Create an intimate feeling And I thought-- One way we could accomplish that is to upholster the walls with a lovely silk moir? ..silk moir? That will give the room a sense of luxury and it will also absorb some of the sound .some of the sound Your other option, of course is to cover the walls with-- Stop it You stop it! You stop it! You're a nutjob! You're a nutjob! You're a nutjob! You're a nutjob! You're a nutjob! - You're a nutjob! - Ladies, ladies! Oh, ladies Vince I think these two ponies need to be hosed down Come out in the hallway for a minute while I talk to them, ok? - Yeah, sure - Thanks So what's the matter, Grace? You can't compete with another designer who actually has a little talent?! - You stole my ideas, freak show! - Oh, puh-leaze! You! Ladies! Ladies! Ladies! Ladies! Hey! Hey! Hey! Come Come. Come. No, no, no, no Come on, ladies. Stop it! Stop it right now, both of you! Come here. Come here Come here right now Oh! Come here Whoa. Now, listen to me! I'm ashamed of both of you If there is one thing that I have learned from studying the ancient Chinese art of t'ai chi is that violence is never the answer but sometimes it is T'ai chi! Is she out? She's out Ok. Honey, you go get Vince I'll get rid of the body Uh, should we maybe go-- We should keep dancing The number-one lesson when you're on a stakeout is never change your spot if it's good Ok La la la la la. La la la la la~~~ A-doobie doobie do-doo~~~ - Hey, that's annoying - Hang on. Let me just get this out Oh! Feel a little awkward It's been a long time since I slow-danced with a cop whose gun is poking me in the back I hope Sh-sh-sh-sh-shh Yeah, you know actually I could use a drink Oh, yeah I'll get you one, honey Did--did you-- Did you just call me "honey"? Uh, cop talk It's the way we talk at the precinct-- Honey, sweetie, Sarge I'll get you a drink Oh, my God! We need to talk When were you gonna tell me you were dating freaky teeth guy?! "Freaky teeth guy"? You have no idea what you're getting yourself into I'd help you but it's not my problem Tell me about freaky teeth guy Let's see We got spinach dip, chives poppy seed bagel and chocolate chip cookies Uh, you got anything else? Oh, I'll just bring it anyway in case we change our minds You know, detective, I-- I have to confess Um at one point tonight when I was with you I kind of forgot we were even looking for my laptop I--I just felt like I was with you You know what I mean? I know what you mean The Sarge at the precinct had an expression for it-- Chemistry But you're not even gay Guess I'm barking up the wrong tree Woof! Woof! - You mean you're-- - Yes, I am I'm not gonna lie about it anymore because there's one thing-- Don't touch the dip Oh, I'm sorry. I just need to nosh when I'm nervous Go on No, well, you know, the first time I saw you when this investigation began I wasn't sure-- I'm not kidding about the dip Just--I just want a little bit All right, Will I want you to drop the bagel and step away from the dip - Ok. Maybe just one cookie - Why'd you do that?! - Problem, officer? - Oh! What's the matter, detective? Afraid you'll see some food in my teeth? Just like you're afraid to ask guys out so you make up some crazy story in order to spend time with them? Who told you that? Let's just say I know a little bird who sang Who?! La la la la la. La la la la la La la la la la la-la la la? There is no gay laptop ring, is there?? No And cops don't call each other "honey"? No Or "sweetie"? One does Will, this is new to me You know, it's really hard I've never dated before Oh, please! You've already done the hard part You came out Now is when you're supposed to have a little fun Don't do this to yourself Just go and ask a guy out The worst he can say is no And even then you'll probably still get a little action I mean, we are guys That's good advice, Will Thank you So is there anything you want to ask me? I don't think so not with that crap on your teeth Take care

You can't go back to Fannie Lieber and tell her that you want a re-shoot Since when are you afraid to tell people what you think? You walked right up to Kevin Spacey and told him he owed you I think it went something like this "Hey, Spacey! Pay it forward!" Ok, fine We'll go I just don't understand why I should be punished for being so photogenic Now for my next trick I'm gonna ask my lovely assistant to get inside the box - Get in the box - No!

Why, yes, it's this way." Whoa. You know, I have been doing this for a long time I mean, I have shot rock stars politicians, movie stars, my own vagina and this is the first time anyone has ever ever asked me for a re-shoot Yeah, but the difference is, you know it's not a big deal to those people or--or to your vagina but, you know, to us this is--this is a once-in a-lifetime opportunity Please?

Yes, we have lives I just got TiVo And I am this close to learning how to use it Well, how about getting something real to focus on like a dog or a plant or an addiction? I mean, something Look, I know Grace and having some plant is not gonna make her care any less about looking like H.R. Puffy-Face And a dog is not gonna make him care any less about looking repulsive - Why do you have to dig? - I'm not digging - You just called me repulsive - I didn't call you "grotesque." Oh, please! You're just splitting hairs now. Repulsive-- Just do something Have a baby I don't know I don't care Just get out of my life Hey, that's a good idea Let's have a baby Sure.

Mrs. Friedman from downstairs gave it to me It's actually a wonderful story She and her husband were saving itfor a special occasion but then he, uh, died before they had a chance to open it so she gave it to me and said "Make your own special occasion" I guess that story's not so much wonderful as it is incredibly sad You know what else is incredibly sad? Poor people with big dreams Actually, that's not so much sad as it is incredibly funny You know, we should do this We should save that wine for a special occasion You know, something where-- where the four of us have all done something that we're incredibly proud of You know, we can wait 20 years if we have to Ah, screw it.

Oh, whatever happened to privacy? I am outraged I'm appalled! I'mI'm turned on! Hot jazz! What's that you say? Sure, he can dance but can he sing? Maria. I just met a "girl" named Maria and suddenly I've found how wonderful a sound can be "Maria," say~~~ what does that mean right there? What's going on there? 'Cause that's in my sightline, ok? You know, um, when they flash the red light at the duplex that means they want the guy to get off the stage! Oh, no, I'm not leaving No, I'm not getting off this stage I--I--I'm gonna read for your play and do you know why? Because I want it to be a runaway hit! Hey! Hey! You don't even know who I am! You don't even know what I can offer! Why, I could--I could be the next Sir Judi Dench or Dame Ian McKellen! Do you really wanna be known as the producers who passed that up? Oh, my god, it totally worked Ok, look I don't know if I'm ready for this I mean, there's a lot of things? I wanna do with my life and I don't know if I can do it with a baby I wanna travel the world Anywhere Everywhere You know, as long as it's clean and they speak English and it's safe You've just narrowed your world travel plans down to Denver Grace, what is the problem? What are you-- what are you doing here? We've always talked about doing this /  I know-- And you're always making us stop in front of baby gap to go "aw!" at the little high tops And the-- and the little baby backpacks! I mean, why would a baby need a backpack? Maybe to carry stuff to his homies' cribs I don't know! Let's just have a baby and find out Come on what's holding you back? - I don't know It's just-- - what? I--I guess a part of me does wanna have a baby, but Grace, it's me If there's something you wanna say, just say it I'm just not sure I wanna do it with you What are you. What do you mean you don't wanna do it with me? For years, we've talked about how we're gonna do this! When my--when my friend Claire wanted my sperm so she could have a baby you said no because it was your sperm! You practically planted a flag in my testicles! Well, that's because it is my sperm But it's my safety sperm You know, like the safety school? You--you apply to college and it's the one school, you know you're gonna get into just in case everything else falls through You're saying my sperm is Florida State? Look, it-- it was a fallback position It was always the thing that I was gonna do if I didn't find Mr Right and I'm just not sure that I'm ready to give up on that yet Yeah, well, you know you're probably right I mean, just 'cause it didn't work out with Danny or Nathan or Josh or Ben or Bill or Mark or Six-Toe or Unibrow It doesn't mean it won't work out with that pizza guy you've been eyeing I'm sure you two will be very happy together, you know with your three beautiful children Pepperoni, Mushroom and Extra Cheese That was mean You know, this is all very easy for you I have the kid ,You're a dad You're happy But who am I in all this? The mom of my gay roommate's baby? That's not exactly the family I dreamed of Well, you--you think this is my dream? I never thought I'd have a child this way! I assumed I'd be with a guy! You know Rick, and six years into the relationship when we got tired of running a bed and breakfast in Vermont we'd decide to have a family Ok, well, what about Rick? Where is Rick? Is he in the TV room where you spend every Saturday night? Does he appear on the gay channel that you added and don't think I know about? I mean, you sat here and you listed my--my failures! At least I have failures to list! At least I tried! You haven't had a serious relationship in five years! No, I haven't! Well, then maybe you need to ask yourself why you want this baby Is it because you are so full of love? And there's no one in your life?? And so now you wanna make a little guy or girl to give it to? So what? Isn't that a perfectly good reason to have a baby? I mean, isn't it? Isn't it? It isn't, is it? So you're really going to watch us have sex? Well, honey it isn't going to be pretty The good news is it isn't going to be long either And it should be pretty quick, too I like you Stanley? Hi, sweetheart Oh, I know it's been so long I can't wait to run up and throw my arms two-thirds of the way around you So come on-- What? What do you mean you're not coming? What happened? You, son of a bitch How could you do this to me? Well, it's been fun, cammie but I'm outta here Yeah The bastard used his library time to do a little insider trading They found out now he's going to be in for a lot longer Why couldn't he use his library time to read the Bible or expose himself to the newbies like the rest of the boys on Cellblock Fat? What?! No, you listen I've been putting on a brave face for eight months well, eight months ago in Brazil I had one put on But do you think this has been easy for me? Well, it hasn't But I thought you were getting out soon so I held on? so that we could start our lives over And then you go and do this you screwed up, Stan No, I don't-- no, I don't know if I can forgive you And I'll tell you something else Mr Walker I'm tired, and I don't know if I can do this anymore Did you know about this? And you didn`t tell me You should be ashamed of yourself I guess I just got caught up in the romantic notion of what it would be like to have a baby with her, you know? I mean, you'd be all gorgeous and pregnant and glowing and booby and when you had the baby I'd be in the delivery room When you were pushing and screaming at me to rot in hell I would And we'd raise him with the values that were important to us Respect for other people's opinions except for you know ones that were different than ours On his first date with a girl--or a boy Or if it's a girl, a boy or a girl we'd be home all nervous and waiting but acting like we weren't Then one day when he went off to college we'd wave good-bye and look at each other and say "You know what?" "We did a good job" I want to have a baby with you! Let's see "Please, Mr O'Shaughnessy I'm begging you" "I can't stand out here any longer in this unbearable" "heat" Oh it's hot "We need food or else I fear my family will perish" "and my harp will break" "heart" "My heart will break" I said "harp will break" Did you hear that? Harp! Bblllingg Bing! Harp! Where was I? Let's see, OK! "Deirdre's got no milk for the wee one and the oldest girl is dead" Harp! I can't believe I said harp! That is the funniest I thought the "P" was a "T" That's so funny Ok, ok, wait "So please I'm begging you" "it's only a loaf of bread to you but for us, it's life" Let me-- let me try that again "It's only a loaf of bread to you" "it's only a loaf of bread" "It's only" I'm just going to stop Ok, I just.. it's just, um This isn't It's me I'm not good, am I? Wait, don't answer that I already know All these years everybody keeps telling me Thanks for your time, though You can, um, put your red light on now 'cause I-- I'm done with all of this I'm not an actor Really, it's ok You can turn it on And scene I can't. I, uh I'm so confused You-- you want to have a baby now? I do Do you? I don't! What? But the reason we're here is because you wanted to have a baby I did, but then you talked me out of it But then you talked me into it with all your talk about talking me out of it But you haven't talked me back into it with all your talk of--of-- Talk me back into it! Oh, this is ridiculous We don't sound like two people who should be having a child This is something we should be sure of Yeah, you're right I mean it'sit's not like super-sizing a happy meal Yeah, 'cause that's always a yes Will, we can do this I don't see how I can I mean what if-- w-what if I am doing this for all the wrong reasons? What difference does it make what your reasons are for wanting to love a child? Isn't the most important thing the love part? And as far as I'm concerned if Mr Right and the father of my child turns out to be two different people would that be so bad? What? We got a million reasons not to do this but I  I just keep imagining this kid in some cosmic waiting room and he's our kid And I'd really like to meet him Me, too Are we doing this? I mean, are we going to have a baby? Oh, my god I guess we are! Well, we have two minutes left Is there anything we haven't covered? I don't know After something that huge it's kind of hard to, uh She never cleans up and it really bugs me It's just a response to his compulsiveness Everything in the refrigerator has to face forward How else are you going to know what it is, huh? Say something!

Insemination The guy goes to this lab where he deposits his sperm then the doctor puts it into this machine that spins it around to get the best sample The woman goes to another place where her doctor waits for the sample to arrive from the lab Then the doctor inserts the sample with a syringe, and hopefully, that results in fertilization Wow I know So clinical - So impersonal - I know It sounds perfect Yeah And I don't have to shave my legs You know, the female reproductive system is so amazing It's a miracle, really So complex So beautiful Yow!

Will, you're my best friend I love you I love what we have together and I don't want it to change Sex changes things It always does We'll end up not calling being awkward together sleeping with the other person's friends just to spite them Ok, I might be personalizing on that one All I'm trying to say is if we're gonna bring a baby into the world there can't be any weirdness between us So, I don't think I can do it this way Are you mad at me? Yeah maybe a little Here they are, Jack The keys to your new office Oh, my god I've never had my own office before I will try to honor the legacy of the bipolar blow monkey who had it before me Oh, and Jack, uh you got this message Something about a voice-over audition this afternoon You're not really going to do this, are you?

                    			- Hi, Grace. - Hi, Jack. - Going to my audition. - Going to make a baby. - Good luck. - Good luck to you too. - Hi. - Hi. Are you all right ? I feel like I was just hit by a bus. Did you see the guy who attacked me ? He was about 12'5", 500 pounds. Big bulb on the top of his head. This is crazy. Who is late for their own insemination ? Hi, it's Will. Is Grace there by any chance ? Well, if she shows up, would you call me ?Thank you. - Thank you. - Is that her office ? No, Benny's Taco on East 74th. Where the hell is she ? I'm really getting worried here. Hey, uh is this sexy ? It's a little sexy. But m-more disturbing. You see, I told you this was faster. You wanted to take the cross-town cow. How do you have a horse in Manhattan ? I rented him in the park, you know. Some weeks we ride; some weeks we just get a pretzel. Ooh, ooh, we're here. Pull over. Parking spot. Score ! Just slide on down. I'll catch you. I gotcha. Wow, you know, some people can't do that gracefully. Thank you. I'm Leo Markus, by the way. Grace Adler. Maybe I can take you out sometime, you know. By you dinner, or You're asking me out ? Oh. You're laughin' in my face. That's Yeah. No, it's good. Guys like that. No, no. I'm not laughing at you. It's, um, see, I'm about to Uh, ooh, this is just ironical. - So dinner ? - No. - Uh, look, Mr. Markus - Dr. Markus. - Uh, Dr. Mark Doctor ? - Yeah, I know. It's pretty boring. I'm just your nice, average, Jewish doctor. Look, I really, really have to Jewish ? I-I gotta go before I find out you come from money. Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 1 And The Horse He Rode In On sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Hey. Jack, what are you doing ? I thought you had an audition. The part didn't speak to me. So, what, it just gave you the finger ? And, uh, opt to ignore, okay ? Anyway, I was thinking about this whole baby thing, and, um, I decided you should have a baby with Kelly Ripa. Why ? 'Cause she's Kelly. And she's Ripa. She's Kelly Ripa. I know, I know, I know. I'm crazy late. - I had an accident. - What happened ? And it better not be something stupid, like when you missed my 35th birthday because you ran into a mailbox. I ran into a lamppost. - Grace ! - I did ! I did. Look ! A doctor on a horse came up and took me to the drugstore to get an icepack. I'm not making this up. I hurt my head. Your head ? Like you keep anything in there. Good afternoon. Do we have the sperm ? You're gonna have to give me a little more notice than that. Why don't you put on this gown, and we'll get started. Hey, it's not a map of space. It's a gown. Come on, open it ! Stop stressing me ! Or our kid'll end up spending eight hours a day chasing his tail. Well, as long as he or she can tell the difference between a lamppost and empty space. Where's the doctor ? Ahh, Miss Beaverhousen. That delicious scent I knew it either had to be you or a thousand wild gardenias nestled in a mossy bank of money. Save it, Lionel. You're just smellin' the cheese dip in your Vandyke. Perhaps we should take a dirty bath together. Take it easy, sleazy. I only came here to give you your key back. I am a married woman. Sure, my husband is an enormous bulldozer of a man who has to be hit with a stun gun before he can be weighed or medicated. But when I said "I do" to Stan Walker and his attorneys I meant that to be forever. I admire your integrity. Would you care to step inside, take your clothes off, and discuss it further ? I would indeed ! Not bad. But better ! Oh, thank God. I thought I was gonna have to breast-feed the baby. I was just playin'. I like what I got. Why are you up ? The doctors said the best chance of getting pregnant was being flat on your back with your legs in the air. So come on, pretend somebody just paid for dinner. - That's offensive. - Pretend it was lobster. Got you a couple of presents. Twizzlers and - A dictionary ? - Yeah. I don't want our kid to say "ironical". Come on, Will. Put your lips on, fix your wig, 'cause we are going to the new club called the Gay Gay Gay Gay Gay Club. Aw, that sounds fun. Will you take me sometime ? Grace, please, it's not that gay. Let's go. You don't move. Ahh, great. Knock me up and run. Somewhere my old gym teacher is saying "I told you so". Well, sweetie, it's been this way for generations. Moms stay home. Dads go out and cruise guys. Or as my dad used to call it "bowling". He even got a trophy for it. How sick is that ? Well, have fun. Bring me back a souvenir Ew. Don't. Maybe I shouldn't go. Come on, Will. I'm all set. Even got my surprise underwear on. - You mean no underwear ? - That's the surprise. No, I This this is our baby. It should be a priority. Besides, it'd feel weird, you lying here, me being out there, giving guys the old "Hey, lookin' fine in your Calvin Kleins". You don't wink, do you ? Tell me you don't wink. He winks. You know what, no. It just It doesn't feel right. I'm I'm gonna take a break from all of it. Yup, I am taking myself off the market, just for a little while. Wow. If you're going to do that, maybe I should too. - So we're not dating ? - I think we're not. - Deal ? - Deal. Very similar to the deal the rest of the world made not to date you. Hi, kids. Just came by to say hello. Heh. I'm fine. Nothing's wrong. Everything's peachy. Hey, Karen, you seem down. Looks like you could use a shoulder to drink on. Thanks for carin', Chuck. Earlier tonight, Lionel Banks invited me to his hotel room. Heh, well, at first I didn't want to go because, well, I'm a lady, and I do have moral standards to uphold. I know ! That was just for us. Anyway so I got to his room; we started talking. Had a couple of minibars. And, uh, next thing I knew he's touching me. I couldn't stop him. I didn't want to ! After years of being with Stan, I felt like "finally a man who knows how to make a woman feel like a girl, and how to make that girl feel like a slut, and how to make that slut feel like a woman." - Did you do it ? - We did everything but. - Well, well, Mrs. Walker. - Ooh. Now, that's interesting. Wait a minute. Everything but "B-U-T", or everything butt "B-U-T-T" ? - Everything but B-U-T. - Oh, well, anybody can do that. But now I don't know what to do. I wanna see him again, but I don't know, should I ? Well, on one hand, Stan did give you permission to sleep with other men while he was in prison. Yeah, but on the other hand, he is your husband; you did take a vow to stay faithful to him. What are you going to do, Karen ? The only thing I can do I'm gonna tell Mr. Banks to take a hike, and I'm gonna wait for my man to get sprung because, let's face it, Stanley Walker may not be a handsome man and he may not be a charming man That's it. What a rook, only five blueberries. $3.50 for a muffin ? You'd think they'd give ya more than Hold on a second. This side is lousy with blueberries. Grace Adler, what are you doing here ? You didn't hit your head on that coffee urn, did you ? Leo, hi, what are you doing here ? It's fate. Once in a lifetime, the stars line up to bring two people together. That and my office is right there. - What are you doing now ? - I'm joining you. - For what ? - Small talk you know, a little back-and-forth. I just went and now you go. - Leo - Is it my turn already ? You know, heart pumps are tricky. Your turn. Okay, I get it. You're fun. But I'm I'm just not dating. I've got a lot a lot on my plate right now, a lot I need to focus on. Okay, I get it. No date. Well, at least let me have a look at your gash. - That is the rudest thing - On your head. From the lamppost. I knew. - Easy, easy. Come on. - Calm down, hold still. - How's it look ? - It looks good. It looks very good. Okay, Dr. Feelgood. Time to go operate on someone else. Let me let me just give you something to help it heal then. It's a topical cream. Just put a little bit on two or three times a day. That's all. "Have dinner with me tonight." Gee, tonight, I don't know, I-I-I I have a lot on my plate right now, a lot I need to focus on, so Good-bye. I'm coming out. Buh-pow ! I want the world to know. I got to let it show. I'm coming out Ooh, I am coming out ! Ooh. Okay, patience, girls. Save it for Lionel. Don't do it ! Hoo ! Honey I knew when you said you weren't gonna sleep with Lionel that you would because that's what I would have done. Sex is a drug, Karen. I should know. I'm a licensed dealer. I hate that you know me so well. But who are you to judge, Judy ? I need the touch of a strong man. And it's not enough anymore having Rosario wrestle me into my robe every morning. - You have to go. Come on. - But it's wrong. What are you talking wrong ? You're the one who told me monogamy was for lesbians. And I still believe that, girl. But I was on stage in acting class, and I had a lot of time to think, you know, during my scene partner's lines, and it came to me. Maybe cheating isn't good for a marriage. I know, honey. But I'm not the one who messed it up. Stanley did, when he landed himself in jail for an extra year and a half. I know you still love him, Kar. And I love you and your money. I don't want to see either one get hurt. Oh, poodle. Mmm. You don't have to worry about me. I know who I'm doin'. Oh, I'm I'm sorry. I was looking for Grace Adler. - I thought that she - No, you're right. She lives here. Oh, okay, um, she left her wallet in the coffee shop. Ah, thanks. She'll be glad to have that back. It's got her frequent frozen yogurt card in it. Just tell her Leo dropped it off. Thanks. Does she know you ? Well, we met in the coffee shop today, and a couple days ago I helped her when she ran into a lamppost. Oh, wait, you're the doctor from the park. Right. You're that That horse guy. Jeez, you ride a horse one time, and all of a sudden you're "that horse guy". And you're what, her her, uh housekeeper ? Who am I ? Well, let's see, I'm the one that's been in her life for 15 years, I'm the one she lives with. I'm the one she's having a child with. So you wanna stick around and ask her out to a movie or are you pretty much set, horse guy ? I'm pretty much set. I was in there two minutes, and I read an entire Us magazine. Leo dropped this off. Oh ! Thank God. It's got my frequent frozen yogurt card in it. - What, aren't you happy for me ? - Who the hell is Leo, - and how long he you been seeing him ? - What ? We aren't seeing each other. He he just fixed my head when I ran into a lamppost, and then I ran into him at a coffee shop. Oh, you just keep running into things, don't you ? Why don't you run into a wedding chapel, get married, and have a baby with him ? - What the hell's wrong with you ? - What's wrong with me ? You broke our pact. - What pack ? - Not pack, pact. - That's what I said, "pack". - No, P-A-C - Let's take a different tack. - You mean tact. No, tack ! Tack, pact ! One ends with a "K". One ends with a "T". I know, it's ironical ! Look it up in the freakin' dictionary ! I didn't break any p agreement. All I did was have coffee with him. And I didn't even have coffee with him ! I mean, if that's not holding up my end of the pa agreement, - I don't know what is ! - Don't give me that. I saw that look in Leo's eyes, those big beautiful eyes, and that hair that probably doesn't even need product ! I bet he jumps outta the shower in the morning and does this - Are you jealous ? - No, I am not jealous. - It's just I-I-I-I-I-I - What ? - When you When you - What ? I- I-I-I I kissed a guy, okay ? At that club the other night, the Gay Gay Gay Gay Gay club. I did go, and I met this guy a hot hot hot hot hot guy. And I know we said we were taking ourselves off the market, but then this, this Pink song came on, and his shirt came off. And I thought "I've got two choices here. I can go home, and I can take care of my future baby mama or I can get this party started." And, Grace, I got that party started. Don't be so hard on yourself. It's a really good song. Anyway, I'm sorry. And, of course, there's nothing going on with you and that horse guy. It's okay, sweetie. Guys are weak. Women are tougher. We're more reliable. We can take care of ourselves. Men go out and get the food. Women protect the nest. Maybe you're right. No, I mean it. Go and get the food. I want some yogurt. Don't forget to get it punched because they don't offer. All right. I'll get the food. You stay here and protect the nest. And by the nest, of course, I mean your hair. And by protect, I mean, run a comb through it. "I can't stop thinking about you. Call me. Signed, Leo's Horse." I can't. Okay, Lionel train. Get your caboose up here ! Oh. Oh, why, Stanley, I didn't smell you come in. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~

Sweet, maybe you should try it like the girl on the box. She's she's arching her back and throwing her arm up and smiling. I can't do this with all of you listening ! All right, we're moving. - We're in the kitchen now. - Ooh, such a long walk ! So far ! That's the worst fake moving I've ever heard ! C'mon. Don't get all cozy with me, Wilma ! I'm still mad at you ! You shoulda told me Stan was gettin' outta the hoosegow. Hey. Who knew he was gonna cut some deal with the Feds ? The only reason I found out was I saw the full-page ad in the New York Times: "Welcome back, Stan. Love, your friends at Pizza Hut." Wait he didn't find out about your affair, did he ? No. Thank God my boobs are like arms. I was able to distract Stan with one of them, while the other one motioned for Lionel to get out the door ! C'mon, Grace ! You peed on everything else in that bathroom ! Why don't you just put the stick at the bottom of the shower ? Hey, Jack C'mere. Stop bothering me. Jack, if there's somewhere else you need to be Hey, what could possibly be more important than my best friends creating a new life ? Oops, time to stalk Kevin Bacon ! Will & Grace Saison 5- Episode 2 Bacon And Eggs sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Kevin Bacon's stalker log, My heart is racing and so am I. Moving in for a closer look ! Hmm, new plant in living room. Must be gift from studio wooing "La Bacon" to do Hollow Man II. Note to self: See if I can get a job applying body makeup. Satin ! Soft ! Manly ! Must remember this for fantasy dream later ! - Honey, I got it ! - Abort ! Abort ! Abort ! Kyra ! Kyra ! I gotta go because my hair's almost dry, and if it gets too dry, then I can't put the gel in it. Well, then it won't look good ! And now it's too late and it's dry. Thanks a lot. Look, babe, I I gotta go. I'm interviewing assistants ! Hey, you're not the only busy one, okay ? Guys ? Come on in. We'll do it in here. I'll call you later. Okay, I love you too. Bye. Look, um, uh, I I feel like I should tell ya I-I've never had a personal assistant before, okay ? See, I've never bought into that whole Hollywood thing, you know ? Premieres, limos, paying people over minimum wage. And it's not because I'm cheap, okay ? It's just that I'm not Hollywood. I'm in a band. The Bacon Brothers ! That's the name of his band ! He's in a band. It's called the Bacon Brothers. Right. Very good. Very good. You're right. And by the way, if anybody wants a CD, there's a bunch of them in a shoebox on the dryer. They're, uh, 12 bucks. Please, sit. So I was thinkin', instead of doing some boring interview, it might be better to kinda find out what you know about me. I'm sorry, that sounds vain me and my career. First film Animal House ! Character's name in Footloose Ren MacCormack ! Number of films with full frontal nudity four ! Number of films with full sidal nudity three ! Number of films with rear frontal nudity priceless ! - Impressive. - Thank you ! The rest of you can go. You know nothing about me. I gotta see the result. No ! No, we've gotta wait for the timer. This is such a huge moment ! Two huge moments. We finally found a use for the butter dish. By the way, we're never using it again. I can't wait, I'm looking. - No ! No ! - Grace ! I just With my fashion sense and your freakish upper body strength, this kid could take over the world ! You ready ? - Yeah. - All right. The doctor said that it doesn't always work the first time, right ? That's right, that's right, we'll try again in two weeks. You know, when you're ovulating again. It'll be fun. I like ovulating. You know, I guess I should stop eating for two. Why stop now ? You've been doing it since you were 11. I gotta talk to you about something important, okay ? Okay, um, should we maybe go out and do it in the street so people can see us together ? And and if it leads to a dance, so be it ? Dude, dude, let's get something straight, all right ? I didn't hire you to be my pal. You're just here to make sure the S.S. Bacon stays its course. So, uh, we're not gonna dance ? 'Cause, uh, you kind of implied in the interview there would be some dancin'. No, I didn't ! I did not ! And would you stop bringin' that up please ? Sit ! This is serious. This is gonna freak you out but - I have a stalker. - No ! Are you sure ? Damn it ! Kyra didn't believe me either ! Why is it so hard for everyone to believe that I would have a stalker ? - Just find him for me, all right ? - Oh, I'll find me him ! And when I find him, I am gonna stop me him. Okay. But it's not gonna be easy. This guy is slippery. If I had a dollar for every time my jock strap had been stolen from the gym You'd have $186 ! It's just an expression ! Karen ya gotta put an end to it with Lionel. I mean, a husband and a lover ? I mean, when are you gonna find time to ignore your kids ? I know ! Honey, I've tried, but every time I go to break up with him, he flashes those pearly caps and I end up bent over the minibar. End up ? Isn't that where you started ? So that's why I sent my number one goon there to break up with him for me. - Rosario ? - Yeah. I kept her tied up outside without food for two days, so she should be extra ornery. Listen, honey, I'm gonna go grab some lunch with some of the other gals from the typing pool. Oh ! It's Zoey's birthday. Fran made cupcakes. Cupcakes ! Friggin' nutbag. Ca-ray-zy ! Am I interrupting something ? Oh oh, no, um, I was just, uh I I I have an assistant, and she's And do you see her now ? Leo, why are you here ? I just came by to apologize for putting my phone number in your wallet. I I wouldn't have done that if I'd known your situation. Pregnancy. - I can say that, I'm a doctor. - It's okay. I don't think Emily Post covers leaving a note for a woman who's pregnant with her gay roommate's baby. Oh, I I didn't know he was gay. I just thought he smelled better than most women. Except you, I mean, you you smell fantastic. Thank you, it's Will's. Anyway, um, I'm I'm not pregnant. - It didn't take. - Oh. I'm really sorry. - It's okay. - Well, in that case, maybe this would be a good time to ask you something Unbelievable ! I can't believe that you are hitting on me again ! I'm not hitting you, conceited ! I I just you know, wanted to know if you'd, uh, decorate my office. I I'm serious, I just wanted to liven up my office a little bit with some of this stuff, This this kinda stuff. A couple a these, you know, like like this weirdness. Does this come in a couch ? Because, I tell ya, it's very Ok, give that ! - I like - You put that down and - You just give Let me have this ! - No, let Give it to me ! Hey ! I usually don't have to work this hard, you know. I have a nice job. And I'm pretty much gonna have this hair until I'm 80. What do you think ? I just can't right now. So that means that you have to go now. I don't have to go. I've got a transplant at 2:30. - But the kidney's in the cooler, so, II - Okay, good-bye. - Hold my hand. - What ? C'mon, hold my hand. All right. Look at that. That should be me. I can't believe we didn't get pregnant. Maybe my swimmers just weren't ready for the responsibility. I mean, all they ever had to do before was just jump out and go "whoopee !" Or maybe they're just a little shy, and they need a little encouragement. C'mon, let me help Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play. I can't believe, in all the time I've known you, that I've had to say this twice, but my penis doesn't enjoy being sung to. - Kneel down ! - What are you I said I'd hold your hand, but I draw the line No, we are stalking Kevin Bacon ! Come on ! Come on ! Get in ! I thought you were his assistant ! It turns out he only needed an assistant to find the stalker. If I stop stalking, he doesn't need an assistant. I had to re-stalk to keep my job and realize my dream of dancing with him in a cornfield. - Come on, catch up, slow mo ! - This is ridiculous ! I swear if I had anything better to do with my life I'd be outta here like a shot ! I left him a cardboard cutout of himself signed "Nice stalkin' to ya". Let's tune in and see how he reacts. Okay, okay. All right, he's seeing it, but he's not he's not moving ! Oh, my God, it's like something flattened him ! Perhaps you're looking at the cardboard cutout, dinkus. Fel-low ? Oh, hey, Kev. Hey ! What's that ? Oh, you're breakin' up, where are you ? You're outside of your apartment ? You're standing right next to me ? What are you wearin' ? - What are you doing, man ? - I um, I I I I I found your stalker ! There is a logical explanation for this. - And now you're touching me. - And now I'm touching you. Karen, thanks for taking me out to dinner. I was kind of hoping I'd have a little baby in here, but I guess a little baby back ribs will do. Well, honey, it's like the old song goes anyone deserves a free meal after having Will's sperm inside them. I think that was from "You're a Gay Dad, Charlie Brown". Oh ! Pull over right here, Driver ! Oh ! Rosie's comin' with. She's up there breakin' up with Lionel for me, so I thought I'd take her out too and get this supportive friend thing over with in one trip. Hey, honey, how'd it go ? - I couldn't do it. - What ? What a man, what a man, what a man, what a mighty good man ! - Oh, Ro-Ro, ya didn't ! - I did ! I'm only a woman. Well, half of you is. Well, you leave me no choice. I'm gonna have to bite the bullet and, uh, - send Grace in there to do it for me. - What ? No way ! I'm not breakin' up with him ! I'm just here for the ribs and maybe some corn on the side. This is your responsibility. No, no, honey I can't ! You don't know what it's like to turn away somebody who is irresistible ! Don't I ? I just met the perfect guy. He's cute and smart and funny. His worst qualities are that he's a Jewish doctor ! But I made a promise to Will, so I turned him down. - Is Will still gay ? - Yes. - Idiot. - Hey ! No, no. Grace is right. We made commitments to our husbands. Nothing's more important than that. I'm just gonna have to march up there and tell Lionel "You're sleazy and shameless. I hate that, and we're through !" You're sleazy and shameless ! I like that, but we're through ! - You're my one true love ! - But you're not mine ! I love Stan ! Stan loves ham ham I am ! Good-bye ! Round two. Look, it's not me. Okay ? Jack's your stalker ! I mean, after he saw you in Apollo 13, he went to every video store in Manhattan trying to find Apollo's 1 through 12 ! Come on, hot shot. There are no cops here, all right ? It's just you and me. Two regular joes. Me a Golden Globe nominee for The River Wild and you, a guy who just happened to be outside my apartment with binoculars. I admit that looks bad, but you've gotta believe me ! I just I don't care that much about you. Oh, really ? Then explain this ! Go ahead, kiss it. I know you want to ! And by the way, the Golden Globe nom was a total surprise, but it really meant something, you know, 'cause it's not from your peers, it's from the Hollywood Foreign Press. - It's not me ! - I think it is ! - I'm leaving ! - Please don't go ! - What ? - Stay ! Come on, we'll we'll split a Shasta, we'll we'll bust open a box of Hydrox ! Whatdya say, cap'n ? I'm no expert, but shouldn't you be calling the police rather than offering me snacks and calling me "cap'n" ? Look, when the stalkers leave, it's the first sign that your career is slipping. It's a little tidbit I picked up from Val Kilmer. You you did a movie with Val Kilmer ? No, but Val was in Top Gun with Tom Cruise, and Tom was in A Few Good Men with me. Huh, that was a short one. Your fans are never gonna leave you, you're a great actor. You're lookin' good, your hair's workin'. You've got the waist of a 14-year-old girl I mean, look at that, that's crazy ! Oh, stop. What was your favorite Kevin Bacon performance ? Oh, wow I don't I don't know, I - I loved you in Footloose. - Oh, yeah, you saw that ? - Yeah. - Any other faves ? No, actually, that's the only one I liked. But but, I I liked it a lot. You know, I even learned the dance, for our high school talent contest. - Did you win ? - Nah. I got a nom. But it meant a lot because it didn't come from my peers, it came from the gay head of the drama department. Could you, uh, do it for me now ? I don't know, it's kinda weird. I don't even know if I remember it. And besides, there isn't even any, uh It's a little more arms. Stop it ! Enough ! Stop it ! Stop it ! You shouldn't be dancing with him ! He's not your stalker; your stalker's still at large ! - But you fingered this guy ! - I did not ! We were just holding hands ! Your stalker's been throwing pebbles at your window for the last 15 minutes. Or maybe you didn't hear me because the music was so loud ! You you're my stalker. I prefer the term "professional crazed fan". A job that's a hell of a lot more satisfying than sewing Prada labels in your Old Navy shirts ! Go get yourself a new assistant ! If you need me, I'll be in your hamper. Hey, man, I'm sorry. I owe you an apology. I don't know how I can make it up to you. Five, six, seven, eight ! What are you doin' ? You would not believe the night I had. Kevin Bacon caught me in the bushes outside his apartment, and we ended up dancing together ! I thought Jack was stalking him. Yeah, he was, but then I was for a little bit. I can't wait to tell our kid that his dad danced with Kevin Bacon. Well, that should save you the trouble of telling him you're gay. Do you realize that in two weeks, that kid could be on his way ? Yeah. Two weeks. Ooh, I've gotta get over to Jack's. Quicksilver's on WE. Women's Entertainment. Wheee ! Leo, hey. It's Grace Adler from the lamppost and the horse and the coffee shop and my office. Listen, um call me. Excuse me, I'm working ! - Hi. - I Uh I thought you might be cold so I brought you some coco. - Thank you. - You're welcome. That would be fifty cents. - I don't have any. - Too bad.

                    			- So this was Will's cradle. - Yeah. - You and your chubby little cheeks. - Ha. - A little wisp of hair on top. - Yeah. Hey, what'd you look like as a baby ? I'll have you know, I was an extremely pretty child. Not that there's any photographs to prove that. I was the youngest of three. By then my parents were like "He's walking. Should we get the camera ? Nah. I'll remember it." So this is fun. Fixin' stuff. - Sandin' things. - Uh-huh. - Workin' up a sweat. - Hmm. - Makes me feel like a man. - Yeah. No, seriously, I'd like a man after we're done. Grace is gonna love this. It's gonna mean so much more, 'cause I worked on it with my own hands. Just like I did with the new kitchen. You gonna pay someone to come in and finish it ? Yep, just like I did with the new kitchen. You know what's even better than being carpenters ? Bein' The Carpenters. On the day that you born the angels got together Jack, stop it. Come on, we gotta finish this. And decided to create a dream come true so they sprinkled moon dust in your hair and golden starlight in your eyes of blue ! And I wonder why I'm still single. Oh, speaking of which Hey, I got a surprise for you. I got us some twins for tonight. One's cute, one's smart, one's straight, one's gay. Just like us. You're sure it was twins, and not just one guy taking his glasses on and off ? Anyway, I can't. Grace and I are really focused on this baby right now. And we've made an agreement no dating. This is the best date ever. I thought you were getting bored around 4:00, and then I thought "Well, why would you be bored ? I'm a catch." So, Leo, being a "doctah" You must hate it when people hit you up for free medical advice ? Yeah, yeah I do. It's the worst Whaddya need ? Sometimes I taste pennies You know, in my mouth. That's like a stroke thing, right ? It can be. Let me ask you something. This is where you're gonna see the whole doctor thing start working. Do you keep your mints in your change purse ? I don't think I've ever been more embarrassed. Until now. Oh, God. I'm sorry. - I thought you were, y'know - Yeah. Leanin' in to I was just grabbin' grabbin' my my sweater. I I can, uh, put it back and, uh, grab it again, if you want me to. Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 3 The Kid Stays Out Of The Picture sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ - Can I ask you something ? - Ooh, serious voice. Let me do my Oprah listening pose. You know Grace is gonna be inseminated again in a few days, and I really think we're gonna get pregnant this time. And if we do, I just want to make sure that our child is surrounded by good people. I hear ya Bye. No, Jack. Jack, I'm asking you to be my kid's godfather. Well, or, rather, his his fairy godfather. Oh, my Oh, my God ! I'd be honored. I'd be moved. That pays, what ? Like $100, $200 a week ? It pays nothing. Well, then, I'm just honored. - Hey, guys. - Hey ! Look at this ! It's my cradle, from when I was a baby. My mom sent it over. Along with a baby picture that says "Second or third child, March '70" with a question mark. Jack and I are gonna have it painted. Pink if it's a girl, and hot pink if it's a boy. And flannel if it's a lesbian. So, what do you think ? Do you love it ? Are you gonna cry ? Do you need a tissue ? It's cute. I can't believe you ever fit in there. 'Night, guys. You'd think Grace could show a little appreciation. I mean, I've been working my gay dad ass off all day. I sanded this cradle partially. You know, I even child-proofed the kitchen cabinets. Yeah, uh, about that I'll show you how to open them later. - What's up with her ? - Ugh, Will. Do you know nothing about the "wimmins" ? They don't respond to pressure. - I'm not pressuring her. - You're all about the pressure ! The baby's not even here yet, and you're already making Grace feel like a bad mother. There's plenty of time for that after the baby gets here. That's not what she needs now. And I should know. I am a mother. You're a father. Oh, difference of one letter. This is the time you gotta stop focusing on the baby and focus on her. Pamper her. Buy her somethin'. And buy me something, too, 'cause I just worked my ass off caring. Will, help me. It's hard. Sorry I'm late. I was caught on the 'F' Train. Or as I now call it, the F-ing Train. Oh, honey, is this another one of your fantasy stories about how people travel beneath the city in a secret underground network of tunnels and trains. It's almost as crazy as the stories I tell you about those mythical places in the desert, where people go to stop drinking. Somebody got some flowers, huh ? Or as I like to call them, poor people's jewelry. Oh, God. They're from Leo. Please, let the card be dumb. Please, let him quote an Eagles song lyric or put a happy face over an "I". Anything. It's literate and delightful. Who ? Huh ? What's this ? Is this someone you met in your "underground city" ? Leo. Jewish doctor guy ? I went out with him. He's so amazing, but I'm supposed to get inseminated tomorrow. God, it's just it's all just happening so fast. Honey, what's the big deal ? Just tell Wilma you need a little more time to see what's happening with cute doctor Jew. I can't ask for more time. We're not supposed to be dating. - Will's head will explode. - Honey, it will not. He cares about ya. He wants you to be happy. You think ? No. Oh ! But if you buy him a present, it might soften the blow. - No, that'll never work. - Well, sure it will, honey. The gays love their presents. Yeah, just wave something shiny in front of their faces, you can get whatever you want. That's how we got Manhattan from the gay Indians. Ugh. Damn it. If only I hadn't kissed Leo. Two weeks ago, I wanted this baby more than anything. And and now, I'm just I'm just so confused. Honey, what is the problem ? - It was just a kiss. - Oh, no, no, no. You don't understand. It was a really good kiss. Sh-yeah ! Show me. - No. - Come on. We're both stoned. - Forget it. - Shut up and show me. Yeah, you're screwed. That's not a curl. That is not a curl. Now that's a curl. God, there's so many things I want to teach my son. Oh Good. You're here. Um, hi. Listen. There's there's something I need to talk to you about. And it's it's kind of important. Yeah ? Is it more important than this gift I got you ? I think it is, but give it to me anyway. Oh, my God ! The wrapping is so beautiful ! All these beads and glitter. Add a couple of spaghetti straps and a hint of butt crack, and it's an Academy Awards gown ! Hmm. Well, I'm not some thoughtless schlub that just gives a gift in the bag it came in. I'm not an animal. - I got you something too. - Oh. Let's open it together ! All right, well, you may need scissors to get through that, because Oh, my God ! I love it ! How did you do that ? I used double-sided tape and glue ! I used unmanicured nails and that one jaggedy tooth I never got fixed. Oh, a foot massager. This is so sweet of you. Thank you. - Okay, now open mine. - Okay. It's so beautiful, I almost don't want to unstaple it. Just open it. Wow, a a personal cooling system. Hey, it works ! You know how I am always the perfect temperature, and you are always freakishly hot ? Well, the salesman said put this on, and you will freeze your nipples off. And it's true, 'cause there's a spare pair in the box. Wow ! That's great ! Can't wait to use that at the beach. Me and my billabongs, with a metal collar around my neck. Should attract an interesting subset of gay men. Look, if you don't like it, you can always exchange it for those turbo nose hair trimmers that you always make fun of but secretly want. What are you talking about ? Come on. I hear the sobbing from the bathroom every time you go at that jungle with the tweezers. - Go ahead, exchange it. - Hey, hey, yo hey, pretty. Does this look like the face of someone who doesn't like his gift ? I love that we don't need a reason to buy each other presents ! So I've gotta talk to you about something. I know that we are supposed to get inseminated tomorrow. But the last couple of weeks, um everything just seems to be moving so fast. And I just wish that I had just just a little more time, because, um God, this is so hard. Sweetie, I think I know what you're gonna say. - You do ? - Yes. I'm rushing things. God, you're not even pregnant yet, and I'm way ahead of myself. By the way, our kid's on the waiting list for Dalton. - So - Will I know, I know. I've been putting way too much pressure on, so let's let's wait a month. Take a little breather. That's not gonna change anything. I mean, I certainly ain't got nothin' better goin' on. And we know you don't, right ? - Right. - Great. So we're cool. I know I am. Oh, there go the nipples. So how'd Grace like the gift ? Did she get all emotional ? Did she cry like a boy ? Yeah. She loved it. You know Grace and her feet. They're almost inseparable. And she gave me something too A great present. - The one we're here to return ? - That's the one. Gonna trade it for those turbo nose hair trimmers ? No ! Anyway, thanks for the advice. You really helped. You don't have to thank me, Will. I'll be rewarded in a better place. Oh, look, we're in a better place. Reward me ! Why don't you roll over in that massage chair and reward yourself. - Hi. - Can I help you ? I'd like to exchange this. Would ya like to look at our catalog ? No. I pretty much know what I want. Um I'm a gardener. And I garden in these these little holes the size of of, well, nostrils. And I just I need something that I can really get in there and and dig out all that extra, uh, foliage. Well, we have these nose hair trimmers Nose hair trimmers ! Wow, that hadn't occurred to me. - If you think it'll work in my garden. - I'll have someone get them. God, I'd hate to be behind you when you're buying condoms. Will, I found it. The single CD shower companion. 'Cause you can never have too many companions in the shower ! Jack. Isn't that why your membership to the Y was revoked ? Ooh, check out the man-cake at the counter. I know that guy. That's that horse guy. Oh, me likes the sound of that ! Come on, intro-seduce me. Yeah, I'd like to, uh, exchange this foot massager. My girlfriend got it as a gift, and she was gonna return it herself, but she's kind of embarrassed 'cause she thinks her feet are kinda big. I happen to think she has great feet. I offered to do it for her 'cause I'm trying to impress her. Say, what is it about you that makes people just wanna open up ? Uh-oh. Your horse guy's straight, Will. He's talking about Grace. Ooh, then maybe there's hope. Oh, honey, I didn't sleep a wink all night. I don't know if it was worrying about you, or those Mexican amphetamines I've been taking, but I have to know what happened with Will. - How'd he like his gift ? - Oh, he loved it. - Oh. - And he said he'd he'd give me some more time. Honey, that's great. So I helped someone. Hopefully, this will count toward my community service. I'm sick of pickin' up trash in the park with that kid from "The Sopranos". The only thing is, is I may have accidentally lied a little. I didn't tell him about Leo. Now, Grace what have I always told you about lying ? That it's good. But it didn't feel right. I've got tell Will the truth the whole truth. Well, maybe it's for the best. Then you and I can move on with our lives. Out in the open to love freely. Karen, we're not a couple. Aren't we ? No. Well, all I know is when I woke up this morning, there was red hair on my pillow and lesbian porn in the VCR. - Hey, ladies. - Hey, hey. Hey, ladies. My feet are killing me. We just walked like 30 blocks. Oh. Can I get ya something to drink ? She's buttering him up. She didn't tell him about Leo. Ya know what I'd really like ? Where's that new foot massager ? He's setting her up. He knows about Leo. You don't need the electric massager. - I will rub your feet. - No, no, get it. I wanna try it. - I don't have the massager, okay ? - She gave it to her guy. - He's a really good kisser. - How good a kisser ? What happened to it ? Did your boyfriend take it back to The Sharper Image ? He's not my How did you know about that ? I saw him there when I was returning that stupid personal cooling system. You returned the personal cooling system ? Why didn't you just tell me that you didn't like it ? I don't know. Why didn't you tell me you wanted more time because of some guy ? - Hey, you want me to show you ? - Show me. - Get out ! - Damn, Leo's good. I'm sorry. I was going to tell you. I started to tell you. And then you were so understanding. And then there were gifts and curled ribbons Grace, Grace, bottom line. Do you wanna have this baby with me, or not ? You said I could have more time. That was before I found out you were sneakin' around behind my back. If you wanna back outta this, I want you to back out now. I don't wanna have this conversation again in a month like we did with the cabinets. "I like the nickel pulls. No, I like the brass pulls. Oh, no, I like the nickel pulls again." Make up your friggin' mind ! So what you're saying is, if I don't do it tomorrow, - you don't want to do it at all ? - That's right, Grace. It's now or never. Well, if that's the case, I guess I have to go with never. Oh, I can't believe this ! This is only the most important thing we've ever done together, and you flake out on me ? I don't know why that's surprising. - You're a flake ! - I am not a flake ! Oh, please. The dinners you blow off, the dry cleaning you forget to pick up, the rent that's late every month, and it's always been this way, Grace. You skipped out on my law school graduation party before I cut the cake. - That was a big deal. - It was carrot cake ! That's never a big deal ! But I always let it go, Grace, because it's not like we're making a baby or something. Except this time, we're making a baby ! Yes, at the moment you say, the place you say, wearing the clothes you say. You are a control freak ! All I asked for was one month, one month to see where this is going. Oh, let me tell you where this is going. You'll end up hating him in three weeks, because I don't know, he has a weird chest hair pattern, or he doesn't like watching E ! Or he'll end up hating you, because you're too needy. Then you'll fall apart, I'll pick you up, and then, magically, you'll be ready to have a baby ! So that's what you think of me. Look, I'm sorry that I met someone, 'cause I know how much you hate it when I'm happy. - Oh, that is such a load - Admit it. You're happiest when I'm miserable. I mean, come on. Isn't that our thing ? Because then you don't have to look at how miserable you are. Shut up, Grace ! But I am not gonna be miserable for you. I am gonna try to be happy, and if you can't deal with that, then you are even more pathetic than I thought ! - Get out of here. - Go to hell ! No, I mean it ! I want you out of here in two weeks ! You don't live here anymore. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			Previously on Will & Grace Grace and I are really focused on this baby right now, and we've made an agreement no dating. Two weeks ago, I wanted this baby more than anything. And now, I'm just I'm so confused. Oh, I can't believe this. This is only the most important thing we've ever done together, and you flake out on me ? I don't know why that's surprising you're a flake. All I asked for was one month one month to see where this is going. Oh, let me tell you where this is going. You'll end up hating him in three weeks because, I don't know, he has a weird chest hair pattern, or he doesn't like watching "E !". Or he'll end up hating you because you're too needy. Then you'll fall apart, I'll pick you up, and then, magically, you'll be ready to have a baby. Look, I'm sorry that I met someone, 'cause I know how much you hate it when I'm happy. - Oh, that is such a load ! - Admit it. You're happiest when I'm miserable. I mean, come on. Isn't that our thing ? Because then you don't have to look at how miserable you are. Shut up, Grace ! But I am not gonna be miserable for you. I am gonna try to be happy. And if you can't deal with that, then you are even more pathetic than I thought. - Get outta here. - Go to hell ! No, I mean it ! I want you outta here in two weeks. You don't live here anymore. I don't know how much longer I can live with Will. I mean, every time I get in the shower with him, he's like "Jack, get the hell out". I know, honey. Grace is driving me nuts, too. She can't concentrate on work anymore. She just sits around all day, doodling pictures of people's houses on these enormous sketch pads. And then, she's on the phone all the time, ordering furniture ? Honey, where's she gonna put all that, huh ? In these "houses" she's drawing ? So we need to get them back together But how ? Pretend to think, pretend to think. Pretend to care, pretend to care. Ooh, I got it. What we need is a plan. Some way to get them in the same room together. Oh, honey, that's genius. Write that down. Oh, wait, not on that. That's for Will and Grace. That's an invitation to Joe and Larry's kid's birthday party. Oh, yeah, I got one of these, too. Anyway, enough about that. We have to figure out a way to get them in the same room so they can work it out. But how ? How ? I just got a paper cut on this party invitation for Will and Grace. Focus ! We're trying to get them in the same room together. Forget about this party they're both invited to. Now, what do they both like ? Well, Will likes to be taller than everybody and Grace likes to eat cake. Where can we take them where there'll be small people eating cake ? Oh ! Shoot, I just spilled on this invitation to a child's birthday party. Hey Are you thinking what I'm thinking ? I don't know. Are you thinking what it would be like to have Spiderman spray his web on you ? Okay, that's just freaky. Okay, that's crazy. Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 4 Humongous Growth sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ You sure you don't wanna go to Joe and Larry's kid's party ? You'll tower over people. I do like to feel tall. Ah, I don't know. Grace and I already said we weren't going, and besides, I don't think I'd be very good company right now, anyway. Okay But, uh, when couples split, one person always gets the good friends. So if you don't kiss up to Joe and Larry first, you'll end up like the ex-Ms. Giuliani. He got the two cool gay guys, and all she got was a part in The Vagina Monologues. Please. They're not gonna choose Grace over me. They love me. And if that's not enough, Joe got drunk one night and let it slip about his Internet chat buddy. That's my ace in the hole. And that's actually the guy's screen name. All right. But don't blame me when the dust settles and Grace is grand marshal at the Gay Pride Parade and you're stuck in Fort Lee doing The 'Gina Monologues. Hi, this is Grace Adler. I'd like to take Will Truman off my Video East renter's card. Well, if you must know, he tried to force me to have a baby and give up a chance at true love, and that kinda person shouldn't be able to rent videos. Thank you. Honey, you're being so spiteful and vindictive. Compliments ? This early in the day ? Oh, honey, you're always the life of the party. Oh, speaking of parties, would you like me to "RSTD" to Moe and Mary ? Uh, I don't know, Karen. I'm really not in the party mood. There'll be a nice cake. I do like a nice cake. Besides, you need to go over there and make nice with Joe and Larry. You don't want them going over to Will's side. They're gay. They belong to you. I'm not worried about them. I have been a true and loyal friend. Besides, one night, Larry got drunk and let some things slip about his secret Internet chat buddy, - so he ain't goin' nowhere. - Okay, honey. Don't blame me if Will is empress of gay America and you're in Fort Lee doing The Vagina Monologues. Okay ? - What ? - I don't know. Look at this place, Will. Everyone's screaming and jumping all over each other. Why can't grownups have a place like this ? We do, Jack. It's known as last call in any gay bar, U. S. A. - Hey, guys ! - Hey ! Thanks for coming. - Good to see you. - How are you ? Hey, how's the party going ? Any cute fathers ? Well, actually, there's this one really hot No. Ooh, I got Hannah a little something. - Oh, Will, you shouldn't have. - Don't be silly. You guys are my best friends. Hannah's my goddaughter, and I just mean the world to all of you. - It's from both of us. - It's actually kinda cool. I adopted her an endangered panda from The Discovery Store. You get a certificate and a pamphlet about the threat to the environment. It's from Will. It's even better than that mile of highway you had cleaned up in her name. I just figured, you know, it's better than some garish, flashy gift with a lotta bells and whistles that she's just gonna get tired of in five minutes Whee ! Where's the birthday girl ? Auntie Grace is here. - What are you doing here ? - What are you doing here ? Yay ! They're in love again ! I don't mean to interrupt, but is Hannah allowed to cut her own hair ? - You gave her a soda ! - It's her birthday ! - You said you weren't coming. - So did you. Ha-ha ! Too late ! You're friends now. - Suckers ! Woo-hoo ! - High five ! Why, you you two planned this ? Just to get us in the same room ? Not just getting you in the same room, no. But getting you in the same room at the same time ! - Woo-hoo ! - Low two ! Stop it. This is not a joke ! Why can't you two just mind your own business ? Wow. Some people. Trick 'em into doing something they don't wanna do and this is the thanks you get ? Come on, honey. While we're here, let's go pick on a gay kid. - Hey, I was that gay k - Shake your skirt, fairy ! Well, I guess one of us should leave. - Yeah, you. Bye-bye. - I'm not leaving. - I brought a present. - I brought a present, too. - What is that ? Your phone bill ? - It's a panda. Oh, God, not the endangered species thing again ? You remember what happened when you gave that to your nephew at Christmas ? Where's my panda ? Where's my panda ? I'll tell you where your panda is, kid in China. - It's educational. - It's stupid. Like like a Barbie in a string bikini is such a smart gift. Why don't you just wrap a ribbon around bulimia ? A doll cannot cause an eating disorder. Nothing is that black and white. A panda is. Besides, I don't need to buy Joe and Larry's friendship with extravagant gifts for their kid. That's not what I'm doing. I'm here because I love Hannah. Oh, really ? And how old is she today ? A lady never reveals her age. I'm going to put my present on the table. If you'd like, I'll put your envelope on the table with the savings bonds and the homemade cards. In other words, the suck pile. Kids love homemade cards. - I hope this is apple juice. - Let me help you there, Joey. Joe-Joe. Jay-Jiminy-Jee-Joe. Look, Will, I would appreciate it if you didn't get high around the kids. I'm not high. I'm just joking with you. That's what old friends do. We joke. Except maybe Grace. She'd probably tell you half a knock-knock joke, and then blow you off for some guy on a horse. How much of that stuff did you smoke ? Kids, don't eat the balloons ! They're poison. - Will, do you mind ? - Nope. No problem, pal. I'm on it. And I'm in it. Where's your kid ? Where's my kid ? Oh, I don't have a kid. Not yet. I'm thinking of adopting, though, which is fine. You know, I'll still be a reliable father. Some people are not reliable. You should know this. Some people think they're reliable, but when push comes to shove, and the pressure's on, - they prove themselves to be what ? - Cheese ? Unreliable. Hey, Larry. You look so good. What's what's different about you ? Except being the handsomest man in the world ? God, your skin is so soft. And what is under this shirt ? A brick wall ? Joe told me that you had some good stuff, but we're off that since Hannah was born. What ? Okay, but I don't wanna do too much, because I might freak out when the clown gets here. No, I'm just touching you in a loving way. Not a controlling way, like Will. You know, Will thinks you're boring. I think everyone is having a really good time. Okay, kids, I'm gonna say this one more time: The balloons are not food ! Stay, I'll get it. I'm allowed to talk to adults ! Wanna hold my bunny ? I would love to, sweetheart. He's my best friend. Well, maybe he is now. But wait. He seems all sweet and cuddly. Meanwhile, he's storing away all these secret resentments. And then one day, when you've done absolutely nothing wrong, his hatred will explode ! Mommy ! Hey, kid ! Heads up. Okay, no, not too much base. And I want tabby eyes and Persian lips. Honey, look at Will and Grace. They haven't said a word to each other for over an hour. - This plan bites ! - Well, it's better than yours Telling those kids those balloons are made of candy. Kids are dumb. I know. I ate a balloon, it tastes nothing like candy. Okay, we're ready. Go get the kids around the big table, and please make sure the camera has film in it. One time. It happened one time. Kids, sit down ! Cake ! - Happy - Let me help you with that. - No, it's okay. I I got it. - No, I want to. - Oh, Hannah's gonna love this. - Oh, thanks, Grace. I found it in the Cookbook for Gay Dummies. - Hap - Just let let me take it out - Be careful - No, we've got it covered Larry, I'm so sorry. - Here, let me help - Don't touch her. Kids, we're going to the deli next door for birthday knishes. Nice going, Grace. Our friendship, a kid's birthday party, your over-processed hair. Anything else you wanna destroy this week ? I don't know, anything else you wanna blame me for, you big bitch ? You're a mess. I'm leaving. - Don't bother. I'll leave. - No, no. I'm leaving. - I'm already gone. Where's my purse ? - Where's the guy with the - Damn it. - Come on. - We are not playing games here. - Give me my purse. Want 'em ? Go get 'em. Jack, what the hell are you doing ? It's time you two patched things up. - Unzip it ! - Will ! This is not the time or the place for your clumsy come-ons ! Now talk to her ! This is not funny. Let us out now. - I'm not kidding, Jack. - I'm not kidding either ! ou guys' friendship means something to me. It means that maybe we don't have to be alone in the world. That some things do last forever. That a fatty and his enabler can find love. Come on, you're tearing the poor kid up ! So either get it together or get it apart. Just get it ! Now come on, Jackie. I hear there's some people here with some great dope. I think I just stepped in a puddle of throw-up. Throw-up makes me throw up. Quit jumping. You're gonna have two puddles. - Please look. Is that throw-up ? - Look for yourself ! I'm not your vomit-looker. I only look at vomit for my friends, and we are not friends. Fine, then you're gonna have to find yourself another spider-killer. I don't need you to kill spiders for me, thank you. I can kill my own damn spiders. What about the one above your head ? - Quit bouncing. - You quit bouncing. - You quit bouncing ! - You quit bouncing ! You really hate me, don't you ? Is this really happening ? We just throw away 15 years of friendship over this ? Don't say "over this" like it was nothing. You screwed me over. I'm planning my life around this. You were gonna have a baby, I was gonna be a dad. And then you just throw it away. It was so easy for you. Easy ? Have you been paying any attention to my life lately ? And since when has finding someone ever been easy for me ? That is not the point, Grace. You just met the guy and you picked him over me. I couldn't pick him over you because you are not an option for me. You know, I actually considered walking away from Leo for you. But then I started thinking about what our life would be like. Just you and me and our baby. And that question hanging over my head. What question ? Was Leo the right guy for me ? I don't know. I don't know if it's gonna work out. But I hope it does. And I'd hope my friend would want that for me, too. I'm sorry, Grace, but it's not that easy for me. - Why ? - Because it's not. Because I need you more than you need me ! Okay ? You you you you got a million options, Grace. You can make a baby with Leo, or Nathan, or any Tom, Dick, and spermy. But I can't. I need you. Well, I'm sorry, I don't know what to say to that. Well, there's nothing you can say. You've made your choice. So, what, that's it ? We're done ? We're just gonna go our separate ways ? I guess so. - I hope it works out, too. - What ? I hope it works out between you and Leo. - You do ? - Of course I do. - I love you, Grace. - I love you, too, Will. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. And I think you should still have your baby. - There are other options. - You know what I really want ? I wanna do this the old-fashioned way. I wanna meet a guy, fall in love Quit going to the gym, 'cause I met someone. And then make a baby. Do me a favor ? Check the puddle ? - It's macaroni and cheese. - Oh, thank God. - That may have been thrown up. - Oh, no ! Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			Hey, what do you want in your omelet ? Hello ? It's the week before Halloween. Right. So candy corn, Good 'n Plenty, and Reese's Pieces. But make it with egg whites, it's healthier. Oh, can you make another one ? Leo's gonna join us. Oh Leo How come every time I say Leo, you have to say "oh Leo" ? Because I'm trying to make the passive-aggressive point that I'm not crazy about him. I don't know why you haven't picked up on that. You know, you could make an effort. This guy's really important to me. I could make an effort, but I wouldn't be able to go "oh Leo" all the time. What are you doing ? Well, you know, I like to dine al fresco, so I opened up a little café "Jacques". "Cimanin" Did you know that Oh, God. Two guys are already lining up for the next Star Wars movie. I wanna show up in two years and cut right in front of them. Adler, do you have two singles ? I'm short. I told the cab driver I was gonna get some money for his tip Screw it, I'm already here. - Hi. - Hey, Will. Hey, Leo ! Great to see you, buddy ! Thanks for dropping by ! "Hey, Leo", I like that. It's a lot better than "Oh Leo". Yeah, how does "Goodbye, Leo" grab you ? Oh, look at this. Pumpkin picking day trips in the Catskills. - We should do this. - I know. We always talk about it. We really should do it this time. We could rent bikes. Bike up there. Pick our own pumpkin. I got a Jeep. I could drive up. We could all go together. Sounds great ! Right, Will ? Uh, sure. Maybe. I got a friend. He loves to bike. Maybe you would hit it off. We could go Halloween, unless you have to work. Uh, it's Halloween. Excellent. Oh, I gotta go. My latte's probably ready. Have you guys been to Jacques' ? No, but I pass it every day on my way to work. That bike trip's never gonna happen. No, of course not. Who does that ? Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 5 It's The Gay Pumpkin, Charlie Brown sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Hey. You guys ready ? I got the bikes, I got the Jeep. I got the annoying clapping. - Come on, let's do it. - Do what ? Pumpkins ? Catskills ? You know, the bike trip. My buddy's in the lobby. He's really excited. Come on. Pumpkins ! Outdoors ! Fresh air ! Let's raise the roof. Too far. He's kidding, right ? We don't do things. We talk about doing things, but we never do them. I know. Oh, God. He thinks I do things ! A pumpkin-picking bike trip on a brisk fall day ? It's madness ! You have to come. Come on, it could be fun. We're always saying we should be more spontaneous, right ? Yeah. I just didn't think it would happen so suddenly. You okay, Kare ? You haven't touched your Jack-accino. Yeah, I am fine. It's just this song. Stan always puts it on whenever we're making love. Or as I like to call it, being trapped under rubble. Gosh, Kares, is it hard to be with him after almost having an affair ? No, honey. That's all behind us. I don't even think about that anymore. Ooh. Look, I got a little spot on my jacket. Out. Out, damned spot. Filthy whore ! I'm sorry, Stan, I almost cheated on you ! You know, I could probably take this to the dry cleaners. Uh-oh. I think your behavior is masking some deeper turmoil. But what ? Grr, psychology is so hard. All right, listen. I tell you what. I'll take you to my gay group therapy. They'll help. No. No more of your damn gay group therapy. How many times you expect me to sit through "Mamma Mia" ? Karen, I'm serious. Come with me. They'll help. I used to have multiple personalities. Now I'm only dating one guy. Oh, and if anybody asks, your drag name is All-Beef Patty. Sorry, there's a - Thanks for doing this. - Well, I'm a good friend. Who knows, maybe this guy Leo's bringing along is gonna turn out to be totally hot. Hello. - Will, this is my friend, Kim. - It is nice to meet you. Score. Nice to meet you, too Kim. Um, why don't you guys go on ahead, - and we'll meet you downstairs. - Looking forward to it. - Down, boy. - Shut up, man. You owe me big time. - Or you owe her. - Huh ? Well, you see what you have there, don't you ? I see what I don't have, the other half of my date. What you have is a pocket gay. A pocket gay ? A pocket gay. The perfect travel-size homosexual. Just pop him in a man-purse, a briefcase, and you're good to go. In ten years they'll be making 'em all that way. And ever since it happened, I feel so guilty. Well, I feel a little bit uncomfortable. All of these gay eyes on me. Judging me. Undressing me. Then dressing me up again in a different outfit. Well, I can understand your reservations, Ms. Beef Patty. But I just want you to understand that we don't judge in here. But seriously, you do seem troubled. But we understand what you're going through in here. I mean, a lot of us in here have cheated Roger. But I think that your conscience is telling you what you need to do. I have to tell Stan, don't I ? In here, we value honesty above all else. All right, all right. Come on, stop ! Little man, you wanna race ? Oh, come on, Leo. It's such a beautiful day, let's Psych ! God, Kim's like a machine. Or a wind-up toy. This sucks, riding around in this stupid yellow helmet. It's like I'm on a bike trip with Curious George. I know. If this seat goes any further up my ass, I'm gonna have to take my underwear off with tweezers. Fall off your bike. Fall off. You'll break something, we'll go back to the lodge, get a stack of pancakes, and end this rotten day. - I'm not falling off. You fall. - He's your boyfriend. - And Kim's your boyfriend. - Hey, stop that ! - You stop ! - Can we just please enjoy this ? God, I'm so sick of myself. You know what ? I'm making a change. From here on, it's a new Grace. And New Grace is gonna be adventurous and outdoorsy. Like the girls on "Little House on the Prairie", but with makeup and sight. Get off it. There's no new Grace. Nobody changes, and there's nothing new. You're just jealous because in the last two minutes, I've matured and you haven't. Any other pearls of wisdom from New Grace ? Yeah. Watch out for the pothole. What does that mean, watch out for the pot-holy sh ! - You okay ? - No ! Leo did this on purpose. Clearly, this whole trip was planned to humiliate me. I get the crappy bike, a micro-date, and a helmet that makes me look like I ride the special bus. Now, Will, let's not rewrite history. The yellow helmet was the only one that fit over your enormous forehead. Whatever. At least now, we get to go home, get away from all this fresh air and scenery, and spend Halloween like civilized people. Getting hammered in a crowded bar. I'm not going anywhere. I meant what I said before about a new attitude. I'm going to finish this bike trip. Oh, please. Nobody has a new attitude, and nobody finishes anything. You know what, Will ? You could stand to be a little more open-minded. Let the new Will out. Who knows, maybe New Will knows how to ride a bike. They were a little bit low on medical supplies. But it's cool. You'll probably pass out from the blood loss before the excruciating pain kicks in. Okay. So what are we gonna do ? - Head back ? - No, are you kidding ? Let's go. Let's hit the road. Ooh, sorry, Will. Why don't you go ahead ? I'll stay with Will. But you owe me one. I owe you nothing. Shut up. Get outta here. Well, this is it, Jackie. The moment of truth. Gonna open those doors, walk into Stan's office, and tell him that I had an affair. And that I feel awful about it. I wish there was some way I could take it back. Please forgive me ! Well, I feel better. What do you say we get outta here ? No, Karen ! No ! This isn't one of those ugly situations where you can just close your eyes and pray it will be over soon, like a Jennifer Love Hewitt movie. - You have to deal with this. - You're right. 'Course you're right. Well, I feel better, what do you say we get out Karen, no ! Oh, why should I ? - Because - Because why ? One of the things I admire most about you is your ability to meet a challenge head on. You see a difficult situation, and you tackle it. You're strong. You're fearless. Your boobs are as high as an elephant's eye. That's why I love you. I'm gonna help you. Okay. I'm opening the door. I'm closing the door. Why ? What happened ? Karen, um, one of the things I admire about you is your ability to run from a challenge. You see a difficult situation and you tackle it with a bottle of J&B. You're weak. You're a scaredy-cat. Your elephant boobs are in my eye. Let's go ! Come on ! Honey ! Get out of my way. - I've gotta talk to Stanley. - No, Karen, he's busy ! What what are you trying to hide, Heidi ? Nothing ! Look, uh, a shiny object. Stanley, that had better be me you're having sex with ! All right, just keep these puppies elevated, and we'll be dancin' in no time. Legs don't heal, and nobody dances. Look, you know, you really don't have to stay with me. - I-I'm fine. - It's okay, I want to. Why ? Because I like you, okay ? I think you're cute. Why do you say that ? I'm not cute. I'm grouchy. I'm inflexible. Give me a lawn chair and an open robe, and I'm my grandfather. You see, and I think that's cute. Ooh, your feet are freezing. How's this ? You don't have to do th Ooh, boy, that feels good Need some help ? Please. Would the Little House girls need help putting a chain back on their prairie bikes ? I don't think so. I am fine. This is fun. Well, take as long as you need. I'm having a hell of a time admiring your ass. Oh, good ! I got it on. I did it ! Look ! How essential is this ? Okay, this is not a problem. This is an opportunity for more fun. Okay ? Guess that's why they call it a to-go cup. - You okay ? - Fine. All I need now is another car to go by with a muffin and a paper. Let me get you something to dry off with. Here you go. Thanks. Fun ! - Hey, Jackie. - Hi, Kare. I hope you're not hungry. The kitchen just closed. No. It's okay. Hmm, quiet tonight. - Well a holiday - Yeah. Can I get you something to drink ? Oh, yeah. Bourbon on the rocks. - Oh, we don't have a liquor license. - I do. So ? It's been going on for months. She works in the prison cafeteria. The hairnet the pork chops how can I compete with that ? Apparently, she had him at jello. So, uh, what are you gonna do ? Well Honey, I left him. Sorry. Trick or treat. There it is. I see the one I want. It's orange. Let's go. Whoo ! Whoo ! I'm right behind you. This is great. I could be in a crowded gay bar right now, getting hammered. Whoo ! Leo ? Leo, where are ya ? - Catch ! - Oh, motherf Oof ! Are you okay ? What was I thinking ? I guessed that you weighed more than the pumpkin. Leo. I have to tell you something. I have been trying so hard to be someone that I'm - And it's raining. - God. - You even look beautiful wet. - I know, but - There's something I gotta tell ya. - You're having a crappy time. I am. I wish I weren't, but I am. I'm wet and cold. And I've got mud on my Juicy Couture shirt. And I've inhaled four bugs. Look, Leo, there is no New Grace. It's just old Grace with pigtails and lower back pain. And I know that you don't know what that means, but I do. So you need a girl who likes to go outside and eat bugs, and I guess you're gonna have to find one, 'cause it ain't me. That's a shame. You were the right size and everything. Hello ? Coat hog. When did you know I was hating it ? When we passed that motel with free HBO, and a tear ran down your cheek. I do love television. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Wanna get outta here ? What's the rush ? I'm starting to feel a little more outdoorsy. You staying at Leo's tonight ? Yeah. What about you ? Ugh. I'm beat. I'm probably just gonna crash. Ok. Goodnight.

                    			Come on, Grace, hurry up. I got an early meeting. I knew when we installed that pulsating shower head it was gonna slow down our mornings. - Grace ! - Who you talking to ? I'm talking to you. Now hurry up and get out of the bathroom. Wait. That is one smooth-talking shower head. Will, it's happening again. I'm having that dream where she's everywhere. It's more interesting than that one about the hot dog breaking up with the doughnut. What are you doing here ? What, can't a friend stop by a friend's place for a quick shower ? Why don't you shower at Marlo and Phil's ? I thought that's where you've been staying since you left Stan. Oh, I am. It's been super cool. Yeah, it's all braiding each other's hair, pillow fights, comparing breast size. Then Marlo comes home, and the fun stops. - Oh, look at the time. I gotta fly. - Karen ? - Your hair. - Oh. Right, I forgot. Thank you. - How does it - Money. That is so creepy. People just appearing out of nowhere. I know, using your apartment like it's their own. It's rude is what it is. What happened to manners ? What happened to respect ? What happened to tennis socks with the pom-poms on the back ? There ain't nothing wrong with those. Oh, Jack. Cute as a button. Not quite as smart. You know what's going on with Karen, don't you ? Reason why she has to shower here ? The big secret ? No, I don't. Tell me. - No. - Tell me. Fine, don't tell me. Now I wanna tell you. - No. - Yeah, come on. Fine. Stan froze all her assets, she has no money, she's too proud to ask for help, so she's living in her limo. Oh my God. She's living in her limo ? You heard that too ? Who told you ? Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 6 Boardroom and A Parked Place sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ So don't lecture me on ethics, Eugene. I don't care if there is no precedent. If we don't put ourselves on the line for this guy, he's gonna fry, and I will not have that on my conscience ! And then Lara Flynn Boyle comes in and totally shuts him down. - I love "The Practice". - It's so good. Anyway, back to business. All those in favor of going to Beefsteak Charlie's for Sarah's birthday ? T. G. I. Friday's ? I'm sorry, the Charlies have it. Okay. Who hasn't signed the card ? Uh, Will, listen. I won't be able to go to the party. - I'm going to the opera tonight. - Love the opera. Dressed up, hanging out with fabulous people. Drinking champagne. If it weren't for the damn music, it'd be a perfect evening. Good tickets ? Oh, the company box. What ? That is so unfair. I've asked to use the company box like a hundred times. - I never get to. - That is unfair. You should have these. Too bad you don't. Hey. Hi, Will. You won't believe who just got off the elevator. Mr. Stein is back, and he's coming this way. I love you, Will. I mean, bye, Will. Mr. Stein ? Doucette's old partner ? I thought he left the business. No, no, he's been running the London office. I never even met him. Okay, look, who wrote "Sarah rocks" in bubble letters ? You took up way too much space. - Welcome back. - It's very exciting to have you here. Enough ! Sit. As you may know, my partner, Ben Doucette, has retired. And it's fallen on me to turn this company around. You may think that just because I've been in London all this time that I've failed to notice this office's deficiencies. Well I have. Not ! You throw money away on new clients who never materialize. Your billing system is rotten. And the softball team has lost two years running to Spragg, Askins and Rovello. And Rovello throws like a girl. Rovello is a girl, sir. Is that any excuse ? You're right. You're right, sir. - What is this ? - That's a birthday card for Sarah. You can sign it if you want to, sir. Right under the wheelbarrow of wishes. You see, this is the kind of problem I'm talking about. I know, I told them not to use bubble letters. I This is a law firm. And you are lawyers. Not schoolgirls writing in a yearbook. Unless I'm mistaken. Are there any schoolgirls here ? There it is. There's Karen's limo. - I don't think so. - No. No, it is. See the red, green and yellow mark on the bumper where she hit that clown ? The one outside Radio Shack ? I don't know about that clown. The one I'm talking about was outside the McDonald's in Times Square. - That's a good McDonald's. - Don't I know it. So what's the plan ? Well, since she's too proud to ask for our help, I say we get in there and we refuse to leave until she agrees to come stay with us. Hey, are you wearing smarty-pants ? 'Cause that's a pretty good plan. Well, maybe not smarty-pants, but perhaps a witty thong. - Let's move in. - Okay. Oh, my god. It's worse than I thought. Yuh. Karen's a bottom. So, from now on, this is protocol. You may not like it, you may not be used to it, but this is the way it's going to be. Sorry, Mr. Truman. Does my pounding disturb you ? No, sir, it just caught me by surprise. Oh, okay. Well, I'll try to be more considerate in the future ! Okay, folks. That wasn't easy for any of us, but I think we're gonna benefit from this new work ethic. Uh, first things first. Did anybody see where my troll went ? Hello ? - Occupied ! - Oh, sorry ! - Mr. Stein, what's wrong ? - Nothing. Can't a senior partner crouch on top of a toilet if he wants to ? Of course. Crouching's fine. It was the whimpering that threw me. - I'll just leave you. - No, wait ! Wait. I can't take it. Oh, all the people staring at me. Listening to my every word. Why do they all stare ? Because you were talking to them ? You're doing it, too. They all know, don't they ? Where I've been all these years. The London office ? There is no London office. You wanna know where I really was ? I'll give you a hint. That's right. The loony bin. The nut hatch. Nana's change purse. No wonder "London" is in quotes on the company letterhead. You know, just between you and me, I wasn't ready to come back now. But when Doucette left, I had to, to save the company. I mean, it's Doucette and Stein. If there's no Doucette, no Stein, what's the company gonna be called ? "And" ? I like you. You're like a young me. Do you know where my red wagon is ? Uh, I'll have to check with mom. Will you help me ? Please ? This pressure's too much. I can't handle it alone. Look at me. I'm nuts. Hey, I don't know what I can do. Well, when I'm down and troubled and I need a helping hand and nothing, whoa, nothing is going right, close your eyes and think of me, and soon I will be there - Mr. Stein - To brighten up even Mr. Stein, Mr. Stein. I'm sorry. That's what they were playing when I had my last treatment. I can't get it out of my head. I'll do whatever I can. Oh, good. Great. Thank you. I have a lunch meeting with new clients at Le Cirque. You go. Use my expense account. Le Cirque. Well, okay, I'll have to cancel my table at Blimpie's, but And I have a court appearance at 9:00 and a deposition at 3:00. Consider them covered. Thank you. You're helping me. If there's anything that I can do for you Oh, please. It's my job. I'm happy to help. But If you held a gun to my head Who told you about that ? No, I'd like to use the company box at the opera sometime. - Sure. Tonight. - I can't. Gary's using it. No, he's not. It's yours. Really ? Thank you. That's so unfair. Poor Gary. For the last time, I'm fine ! It's a temporary cash flow problem. Now get out of my limo, bozo. And take your little circus poodle with you. Karen, we're not going anywhere unless you come with us. Listen, I do not need your help, all right ? I may be alone, broke, living in a car and spooning a domestic, but Karen Walker has her dignity. Got it ? Here. Throw away my urine. It's bad enough I have to do this at the mans. Ugh. Karen ? Come on. Stay with me. No ! Kar, you may think I only love you for your money, but you know what else is true. I care about you. And that's why I pledge that we will stay here as long as it takes. Very funny, putting a quarter on the bottom. - Mr. Stein ? I - Mr. Stein ? Mr. Stein, it's me, Will. Oh, Will. How nice to see you. How you doing ? Pretty good. Pretty good. You ? Wonderful. I wanted to th Mr. Stein ? Mr. Stei ? Do you think it would it would be okay if you and I were If you and I were in the the same room together ? I don't see why not. Shall I wait here, then ? Yeah. Yeah, you wait right there. I just w Mr. Stein ! I wanted to thank you for letting me use the company box last night. The seats were so comfortable. My ass couldn't stop talking about it the whole way home. I'm glad you enjoyed it. It's the least I could do for all your help. We need your signature on these before we can send them out. Good. Fantastic, sir. Next time, we'll try signing your name. You saved me again. How can I thank you ? Let me do something for you. No, it's not necessary. How do you like that corner office ? The one with the French doors and the private bath ? But that's Sarah's office. She's had that for 30 years. Mmm. God bless her. She deserves it. What a treasure that woman is. Oh, there she is now. Oh, Sarah. Sarah, dear. You're fired ! Now clear out your office, darling. Enjoy ! Last chance, Karen. You gonna spend the night here Or we gonna go back to my nice, soft, comfortable bed ? Good Lord. You will do anything to get into my pants. All right, then. Let's go to sleep. All right. - Night. - Night. Noches. Jack ? That had better be your penis. I can't do this. I sleep on my left. Turn. Night. Noches. Grace ? That had better be your penis. It's a thermos, but thank you. Rosario ! She keeps poking me with her - Oh, don't be saying that - Don't kick me ! - God, what is that smell ? - What do you want me to do ? Stop it ! This is crazy. The only reason to spend a night in a limo is if the drummer in your prom band dropped a Quaalude in your Fresca. Look, we get it. Okay ? We get it. Going through a hard time right now. You just left your husband. But we're your friends and we love you. And if we can't help each other out in the hard times, then what are we doing ? Ditto. You know Jack, what you say is right. But no, I'm staying here ! - Why ? - Why ? Good Lord, Jack. If I gave in to every persuasive argument, I'd be in some crazy three-way marriage with Maury Povich and Connie Chung ! Fine. Come on, Jack. We're outta here. I mean, if Karen's not gonna take my help, then I'm done. Let her live in her limo. A lotta people a lot worse off than that. In Russia, entire families live in their limousines. Good God, Grace. I beg you to pick up a newspaper. I can't believe you're taking Sarah's office. She's like the office grandmother. You're taking Bubby's office. Hey, as long as there's been offices, there's been office politics. In fact, that's why they built offices. So office politics would have a place to play out. Everybody gets it. Nobody takes it personally. - Will ? - Oh, hey, Gary. Look, lemme show you that birthday card I got for Kelly. On the outside is a word balloon that says "Happy birthday from the bunch of us". And on the inside, bananas are talking. Clever. But we don't need your card, Will. We bought our own. - Oh, you did ? Okay, I'll sign it. - No, we don't want your signature. In fact, here's your $4.50 back. The Gap gift certificate ? It's just from us. $4.50 each ? Wow, that's like 18 bucks. Happy birthday, Kelly. Knock yourself out at the irregular T-shirt table. - You guys mad at me ? - What do you think, Will ? You got Sarah fired. She was like a grandmother to me. Well, now you can visit her twice a year like you do your real grandmother. I got that office because I'm good at my job. No, you got that office because you kissed Stein's ass. That is not true. Stein treats me the same way he treats anybody else in this firm. Oh, Will, I'm clearing out that office next to yours so your assistant won't be so cramped. - But that's Gary's office. - Yes. Oh, Gary, I need to speak to you later. Enjoy your lunch. - Hey. - Hey, G. Where you been ? Well, I thought I saw Karen's limo down the street, so I thought I'd try one more time to talk some sense into her, but when I opened the door, I found Mariah Carey eating ramen in her nightie. Apparently, living in your limo isn't as weird as we thought. Well, I couldn't just sit here, either. I've been to every gay bar in New York. - Looking for Karen ? - What ? - Will in the shower ? - I don't know. I just got here. Listen, you gotta talk to that shower head. He got a little fresh. I had to put him in his place. Well my place. Karen, what are you doing here ? Did they tow your house ? Or did someone decide to let her friends help her ? What ? Your face is pulled too tight. I don't need any help. Come on, Karen. Stop pretending. You're lonely, you're down and out, and you need us. So don't let your stupid pride get in the way of you asking for help that you obviously need. Amen. Okay. You got me. You're right again, Jack. Sorry I was so stubborn. I do wanna stay here. In fact, there's nowhere I would rather be than here. With my two best friends. Lady Stan caved ! Our money came in ! Adios, suckers ! I'll be at the Palace Hotel ! Oh, you kids wanna come with ? I hear there's a gym with an Olympic-sized lifeguard. Honey ? - Free porn. - Grabbin' my coat. There you go, sir, just like you like it. Now, just You can take it from here, right ? I don't have to make a little airplane and fly it into your mouth, do I ? No, Will. I'm not a child. Am I ? Mr. Stein, I, uh, I have something difficult to say. Is it "Annie hit Frannie on the fanny with a flounder" ? Yes. Yes, and thank you for saying it. Now I don't have to. One more thing It's not that I don't appreciate all you've done for me, but I just have the feeling that our You're dumping me. I can't dump you, sir. We're not a couple. That's exactly what you'd say if you were dumping me. Hey ! This fish is raw ! Mr. Stein. Calm down. All I'm saying is it's clearly unhealthy for you to rely on me Please. Please. Is it the office ? You can have mine. I'll fire me. Stein, you're fired. You can't do that I just did ! But my wife and children I don't give a crap about your wife and children. - Mr. Stein, stop. - Its not fair. - Fair has nothing to do w - I hate when you guys fight. Please. I need you. You don't need me. You're a legend. You're the man that saved the lead-based paint industry a $100-million lawsuit. - I used to be kinda tough. - "Kinda tough" ? You obliterated those third-graders on the witness stand. Well, I pretty much let them hang themselves. Don't you be so modest. You're a killer. You're a shark. You're Stein. Say it. It. No, say say "I'm Stein." - Louder. "I'm Stein." - Louder. I'm Stein ! Like you mean it, "I'm Stein ! " - I'm Stein ! - One more time ! I am Stein ! Now get outta here ! This is my building ! Why aren't you working ? What am I paying you You ! Get that edamame off your desk. Man. Very good, sir. Very, very savage. This people will think twice about ever going into a Japanese restaurant again. - You did it again. - You saved me. Will, I wanna thank you from the heart of my bottom. No. Wait. Strike that. Reverse it. All right. Get the check. What do you mean, "Get the check" ? I paid last time. You didn't pay last time. What are you talking about ? What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? Listen to you guys. What are you arguing about ? - You just call out my name - And you know wherever I am I'll come running. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh. Sorry. You're still doing it.

                    			Hey. Let me ask you something. Am I too old for this shirt ? - No. - Truth. Yes. Really ? Some young gym-trash were whispering about me during spin class. But I think it kind of makes me look like an Abercrombie & Fitch model. Yeah, maybe from when they founded the company. Great. Where are we supposed to shop now ? The Big-and-Tall & Old-and-Gay store ? Might as well get fat too. Let's eat. Can't. I'm savin' my appetite for tomorrow. Leo and I are going to that all-you-can-eat brunch at The Plaza. Wow, you guys must be pretty serious, if you're allowing him to see you in any sort of all-you-can-eat context. Next thing you know, you'll meet his parents. He's already floated going to Atlanta for Thanksgiving. I put a kibosh on that, but quick. I've already fooled him into liking me. I don't know if I have the energy to fool two older, wiser people who I can't confuse by having sex with. My friends, it's finally happened. My fame has reached a new level. I just got recognized on the street. Jack, someone yelling "queer" from a passing car is not a fan. You didn't hear the way they said it, my friend. Oh, Will, someone was asking about you in the elevator. Yeah, it was your youth, and it wants its shirt back. Anyway, little reminder. My acting class showcase is tonight. It's gonna be very fun, very cas. Very smokey, very B.O. Ah, Jack, I already have plans with Leo tonight. I'm sorry. I won't be able to make it. Oh, Jack. I have no plans tonight. I'm sorry, I will be able to make it. Poodle, I am planning my entire weekend around it. Tonight I'm at your showcase, laughing and crying. Tomorrow I'm at Dermy's, pumping my face full of enough Botox to erase any sign that I ever laughed or cried. Sundays I go to worship at St. Patty's. Or the Rusty Nail, whichever has happy hour. Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 7 The Needle and Omelet's Done sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Hey, sorry I'm late. Is it over ? Did I miss anything ? - No. - Damn it. Welcome to Scene Study Night. If I had known 50 years ago that I would be working with young actors like these, I woulda hanged myself. Oh, who's up ? Oh, crap. Jack McFarland, get up here. Thank you, Zandra. I've chosen a classical piece. But I believe it still speaks to us today. Hi, Karen. Hi, Will. At first, I was afraid. I was petrified. Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side, but then I spent so many nights just thinking how you did me wrong ! - And I grew strong ! - Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! What in the hell is this, bitch ? Well, wha what do you mean ? I'm acting. Oh, is that what that smell is ? You stink. I've been studying with you for five years, so maybe if I stink, it's because you stink. Do you think you could do better than me ? Well, be my guest ! People Mr. McFarland will be teaching your classes tomorrow. Those of you who are lucky will die in your sleep. Oh, my god, this is so exciting. I'll see everyone tomorrow promptly at ten-ish, okay ? Oh, uh, boys in tight T-shirts. Uh, girls' attendance, optional. Oh, my God, you guys. Did you hear that ? Zandra wants me to teach. I'm gonna be her prote-gay ! There goes our little Jackie, all excited. The man stares humiliation in the face and says, "Don't I know you ?" Listen, Karen, um, let me ask you No ! I'm not Grace. I'm not gonna go to some gay piano bar with you and sing crappy show tunes, while we slug back dirty marti's and make out. Well, I had to ask. Actually, no, I was just curious. What did you say you were doing tomorrow ? Honey, I already told you. I'm gonna get some Botox, and then I'm Why, Wilma ! Does my little 'mo wanna get a little bo ? Not really. I just I may be a little bo-curious. Well, come on, honey. I know a cute little piano bar right around the corner. Yeah, we'll have some dirty marti's and talk about it. And if we make out, so be it. The key to a successful brunch strategy is knowing how to work the buffet. See, they put all the cheap stuff, like scones and muffins, in front. I mean, how many of those can you have ? Eight ? Ten ? That's like four bucks. Meanwhile, the smoked fishes and other pricey items are around the corner. What do you have, a map ? I cased the joint last week. You're an interesting girlfriend, Grace. Oh, that melon looks good. I'm might get some of that. Melon ? Have you not heard a word I said ? After this round, we hit the crab cakes, and we hit them hard. By the way, some friends of mine might meet us here today. It's a college professor and his wife. You don't mind if they join us, do you ? Well, do I have to button my pants ? I told you in the cab, no. We need m-more mimosas. - Hey, stranger. How are you ? - Good. Grace, this is Jay and Eleanor. Guys, Grace Adler. Nice to meet you. Will you explain to this lunatic that they did not move the George Washington Bridge. Well, yelling "turn here, jackass, turn here" doesn't help me find the exit, darling. Please, sit. We just ordered mimosas, which I believe is French for "I don't wanna wait till noon to get hammered." Wow. I can't believe these before-and-after pictures. Look at this one. Before, she's this gnarled old witch and then after, she looks like Pleasant office. Nice to see you again, Mrs. Walker. You know, you come in here so often, I should really give you one of those little cards so, after 12, you get a free one. Oh, Doc, too bad your comedy is lost on people with dead faces. And you must be Mr. Truman. Is this your first time ? Yeah. I'm a little nervous, so if you can kinda ease me into the whole process I guess we're just gonna start Boy, you really don't believe in All right. I think we're done. You okay ? Yeah, as long as I can pull off a sleeveless Abercrombie & Fitch T-shirt. So, Mrs. Walker, the usual ? Oh, no, honey. Mommy's got a deep one today. Break out the crap you're testin' on rats and pigs. Whoa, 75 bucks for brunch ? Does a hooker come with that ? But I guess you doctors are not worried about that. Hey. Come on, you're a doctor too. Sure, it's of art history, - but that's almost like helping people. - God bless you for doing that. To be honest, I'm not really a big fan of the museum. The Louvre I went through that sucker in a half hour at a dead run. Give me the "Pet Psychic" any day of the week. Is that, uh, some sort of a cartoon where a dog can read minds ? What, do you live under a rock ? Okay, wait, I don't want to oversell this. It is the greatest TV show ever ! Well, we don't watch television. Oh, God. That's a load of crap, and you know it. I prefer the theater. No one likes the theater. It's just an expensive nap. You hear that, honey ? Those five books I wrote were about a nap. Wait a minute. Maybe that's why I felt so refreshed after reading all of them. You know, you are a weisenheimer. Come on, Jay. Let's get some food. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That vanilla yogurt looked good. Yogurt. Dumb ass. They were nice. Yeah, yeah. I knew you'd like them. See, it wasn't so bad meeting my parents, was it ? No. What ? They're your parents ? You invite your parents, and you don't tell me they're your parents ? Well, it's it's just that they're not my parents. - They're not ? Why did you say that - They're my parents. Leo ! Why are you looking at the waiter ? - What is he, your brother ? - He he is my brother. - He's your brother ? - He's not my brother. You really should not be screwing around with me right now. You lied to me. I know how freaked out you get when I talk about my parents. - I was trying to protect you. - But you didn't protect me. I looked like an idiot. No, you didn't. You looked like the real you, Grace. So, so the real me is an idiot ? I didn't say that. You said you're an idiot. Oh, so you think I think I think I'm an idiot. I- I-I-I I-I think I think that you You're pretty ? Leo, I didn't want your parents to meet the real me. I wanted them to meet the phony me, the better me, not the one who boos your mother. Oh, my God, I booed your mother. That was awesome ! Come on. You should be thanking me. I- I just mentioned going to Atlanta for thanksgiving, and you fake a panic attack. How dare you ? I did not fake a panic attack. I don't fake any Hi ! Oh, honeydew, sweet like "Sweet Charity," which is a play about a hooker. Okay, let's begin. Uh, Joanne, you have an audition this afternoon. Tell us about it. Well, it's a PSA. Okay, for those of you who do not know, PSA stands for sexually transmitted disease. I play this woman who's just had a baby. And her child will never know his grandfather because he died of lung cancer from smoking. Ooh, ouch. Wow. I'm gonna need a minute with that one. Well, I guess I didn't need a whole minute, okay. Let's go on. Come on up. And, Joanne, action. It should have been the happiest day of my life. We're stopping. What's this, honey ? What's this mess here ? What's the water coming from here ? What's that ? I'm crying because my kid's never gonna meet his grandfather Hm-mm, but when you cry you're ugly, sweetheart. Well, I'd like to be pretty, but cancer is sad. And Libras are playful. They say acting is reacting. I say acting is attracting. Are you attractive enough ? I see a lot of puzzled faces. But not many attractive ones. But I prepared. I spent a day with a woman who lost who father to cancer. I can't help you get that time back, sweetheart. But I can help you get this part. what's happening is you're too hung up on what's in here. The audience, they can't see that. They can only see what's in here, okay. Act from here, honey. Act from your hair. All right ? But not that hair. Get some highlights, take those teeth a few shades up, and, hello, Joanne, beautiful breasts. How 'bout can we see them ? You're an idiot ! Or am I brilliant ? Russell, come on up here. Take your shirt off. Ladies and gentlemen, this is acting. Gray skies are gonna clear up. - Put on a happy face. - I can't ! Brush off the clouds and cheer up. - Put on a happy face. - I am ! Oh, life's a party with a face full of poison. My face hasn't been this immobilized since they bought me a lap dance at my brother's bachelor party. You know, in the early days, we didn't always have it easy, like you. No. We had to go down to Chinatown, where they'd inject our frown lines with mayonnaise that had been left out in the sun for a week. Well, we certainly owe a lot to you pioneers. Oh, I'm gonna go put on my Abercrombie shirt. Wow, look at me. This is really working. Nothing's moving. Welcome to the wax museum, honey. Where nothing ever moves, and people are always amazed at how life-like you look. Honey, what's the matter ? I d I don't look like me. And when I said, I ran through the Louvre, it was only because I was so inspired, I had to run back to my hotel to paint. - You don't have to do this, Grace. - Do what ? I'm not doing anything. What're you doing ? That's the bigger question. Theater, do you spell that with an R-E or an E-R ? I don't mean "ER," the TV program. - I don't watch television, either. - Grace, really. You can cut it out. You cut it out. You're the doctor. Or are you ? I don't know. What is she talking about ? I didn't tell her that you were my parents. I just said that we were old friends. That's right. He lied. Just like the boy in that play who lies all the time - Help me out here, Eleanor. - Uh, Pinocchio ? Yeah, Pinocchio. Your son's a Pinocchio. Is this true, Leo ? Did we raise a Pinocchio ? - I think you did. - Okay, okay, I get it. I screwed up. I shouldn't have lied. You see, this is a big deal to me. I love you, Grace. I'm introducing you to my parents. I just want everything to be perfect. Because I think you're perfect, and if I-I-I Agh ! If I were replacing an aortic valve, I could do it with my eyes closed. But this this is delicate ! It's it's brunch ! I think we should let them have a moment alone. Come on, Jay. Go pay. For everyone ? Look, I don't know what you want me to say. I'm sorry, okay ? - What ? - What you said. You love me. That was the first time you said that. Yeah, I was gonna say it earlier. I was just looking for the perfect time, which was before you called my dad a "dumb ass." You know what ? I love you too. So We did the I-love-you thing. We did. - And it felt nice. - Yeah. But if you ever lie to me again, they're gonna have to stitch your 'nads back together. - Oh, Leo, your parents are still here. - They're not my parents. Ow-kay. She's serious. Thank you. Great scene. Finally, somebody makes Death of a Salesman watchable. How did that feel ? Okay, I just I don't remember there being a kiss between the brothers. That's the difference between acting the play and Jack-ting the play. Well, McFarland. I gave you a class of crap, and you managed to make crap-ade. I does what I can. Would you please, please get the hell out of here. Just get out. You can't act. You can't teach. You got nothing to offer. - And you never will. - That's not true. I did everything Jack said, and this afternoon, I got my first job. The anti-smoking thing ? No, I didn't get that one, because I seemed too jazzed about my dead dad. The same casting director liked my smile and put me in a toothpaste commercial. Even better. You see. She's actually helping people. She's transformed from an actress into an attractress. Get out. - Zandra, what are you saying ? - Get out ! Are you saying you want me to get out ? Does anyone have some boiling soup ? I don't think I like your tone. I am a good teacher. And if you don't want me in your class anymore, Zandra - I'll start my own. Who's with me ? - I am. So am I ! And do you know why they're coming with me, Zandra ? Because I touched people in this class today. And when no one was looking, I touched myself a little bit too. - Hey. - Hey. The most amazing thing happened to me tonight. Leo told me that he loved me. Oh, honey. I'm so happy for you. Really ? 'Cause you don't look happy. - Trust me. I'm thrilled. - Will, are you really doing this ? Are you still pouting about me and Leo, because, you know, it is so childish. - No, I'm really happy for you. - Unbelievable. - Let me know when you grow up. - Grace, I'm happy. I'm happy ! Now I'm sad. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			You know, I think fall is finally here. I just saw the first drunk of the season turn yellow and tumble gently to the ground. I tripped, okay ? What is with a picnic in November anyway ? I'm freezing my perfect peach off. OOh, yeah. This is it. This is perfect. Right here. And, Jack, take off that hat. It makes you look like a woman. Oh, it wasn't the hat. - Why are we doing this ? - Come on. It's sunny. It's New Yorky. I read this thing in "O", the Oprah magazine on tapas picnics, - and I've been dying to try one. - Oprah can be a lot of fun. And there's no one I'd rather have watching my back in a bar fight. Hey, guys. Sorry we're late. We grabbed a couple hot dogs. - I told you I was making tapas. - I know. Oh Leo. I don't know if we have enough food for five people. That's okay. Grace just ate enough hot dogs for five people. Honey, you got a lump under that arm. You might wanna have that looked at. Come on. It's November in the park. I thought we'd, you know, toss around a football. Um, look, Leo. I know you're new here. And, um, we don't want you to think we're really cliquey and don't let anyone in our little group. But, um, well we're really cliquey. We don't want anyone in our little group, so So, if you wanna break into the fag four, this symbol of gay oppression has to go. Come on, Jackie. Get rid of it. Who knew I could do that ? Ladies and gentlemen. Prepare yourselves for the finest feast this side of Barcelona. My gift to you. Enjoy. It's a boomerang. It went around the world. My platanas bravas ruined, splattered all over this cashmere throw, and look at these broken ramekins. You're a trip, Will. Oh, sweetie. It's probably going to take a while to clean up. We're gonna go make out. Holy cripes. Am I outside ? Hey, kid, can you tell us what's going on here ? Did you just call me kid ? - You're Katie Couric. I love you ! - Well, thank you. I'm sure if we spent more time together, I'd love you too. So, uh, what is going on here ? Talking with Katie. We're just having this mass wedding. Some stupid stunt for sweeps. Well, if you're here, where in the world is Matt Lauer ? Laughin' with Katie. Yeah, I asked myself the same damn question when they told me I had to work on a Sunday, as if being cute and perky five days a week isn't enough hard enough. I hear that. Hey, you two look happy. Would you like to get married today ? Sure. Yeah, why not ? What do you say ? Yeah, why not ? We'll help the ratings. Would you excuse us, Katie Couric ? What are you doing ? I'm serious. We met in the park. Let's get married in the park. But this is just I mean, we're talking about We've only known each other, like, two months. Grace. Come on, you know we're gonna do it eventually. You know what ? I'm doing this all wrong. Grace Adler, I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. So here, today, right now, in front of God and Katie Couric, I'm asking you Will you marry me ? Yes. Yes, I will. Let's do it. This is just a temporary ring, right ? Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 8 Marry Me A Little (Part 1) sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ That was a disaster. Tapas in the park. That's the last time I cook something out of a magazine. Ooh, "Gourmet" has a special on savory pies of Edinburgh. Save your appetites, lassies ! Hey, what happened to Grace and that foreign fellow she's been hangin' around with ? Maybe they went to the Guggenheim. That's a real place, right ? - What happened to you guys ? - Are you gonna tell them or shall I ? Well, if you don't mind, I kinda want to. - Okay. Go ahead. - Okay. We met Katie Couric ! No, no. That's not the news. We got married ! What ? Just now, in the park. - What ? - There was this mass wedding. What ? Leo made me a ring out of a dandelion. He asked. I said yes. I threw a pretzel bouquet. A duck caught it. It was all just so romantic. And we're married. Oh, my god, Grace ! Look who penetrated the inner circle. And then he stuck around and married her. Don't get too comfy. You may have Penelope Cruzed your way in, but you can just as easily be Mimi Rogered out. Huh ? Hey. What do you think ? Wow. What a surprise. That's crazy. Just spring it on us like that. That's that's great. - Leo, great. - Thanks. And, Grace best of luck. "Best of luck" ? Well, thanks for coming to my bat mitzvah, Uncle Hachem. Have a safe drive to back to Syosset. I don't know what half those words meant. Um, what's going on ? What ? Nothing. I'm happy for you. You know, it's the biggest moment of your life. Why would you include me ? I-I don't matter. I'm nothing. Best of luck. That is so freakin' lame ! You listen to me, Will Truman. I know that this is sudden and not the way we thought it was gonna be, but you are my best friend, and you will be thrilled for me. - Would you You're hurting me ! - It's about me ! I'm the bride ! - I'm the bride ! - Take it easy. Whoa, hey. - You hear me ? - Take it easy. Don't break him. I still need him for the 20% of you I can't handle. Hey, uh, help me out, guys. Come on, Grace. You're married ! Let's celebrate by throwing away most of your clothes. I don't need to throw away my clothes. What about the whorey-lookin' stuff you use to pick up guys ? Let's go. - Will, are you okay, man ? - I'm fine. I just wish if Grace was going to finish the Hershey syrup, that she wouldn't put the empty can back in the refrigerator ! I'm the bride ! Will, I know you feel left out. Would it help to know that right before we got married, Grace said "I really wish Will were here ?" And I said "Me too ?" - Really ? - I just asked, would it help ? Cutting the tension with cruelty. How thoughtful of you. I'm sorry. I know you and Grace have been friends forever. And I just come and whisk her away like that. - It's gotta hurt. - It does. Look, I know that I-I-I put out this tough-guy image. I know people think of me as all hard and strong and macho-y. Look at this flower arrangement, it's atrocious. The truth is, it does hurt. I'm never going to have a wedding of my own and I being a part of Grace's was important to me. What are you talking about ? You you can have a wedding. Oh, please ! Gay weddings ? Some witchy lesbian waves a stick over you on a beach somewhere. While a drag queen sings "Evergreen". I'm talking about a traditional wedding. Grace and I used to stay up nights talking about what hers would be like. I didn't have a hell of a lot going on at the time. I-I I'd have this beautiful tux, big through here and small through here. She'd have a gorgeous gown. Small through here and big through here. At the reception, I-I'd make a great toast. And everybody would laugh at the right places and cry in the right places. And then we'd do this great dance that we'd tell everybody we hadn't worked on, but secretly we had. We can still do all that. - I- I didn't know you were - I mean it may not be the first dance, but it could be the second. Are you talking about a wedding reception ? 'Cause I'd really be into that. You guys would do that for me ? No, not just Yeah. Just for you, all for you. I am going to be so beautiful. It's almost time for my toast, so give me a really good introduction, okay ? Okay, I got it. It should not include the words "bald," "fat," or "impotent. " Okay, give me five minutes. Give it to me, Change it up. This all happened so fast. I don't even know from Leo. I'm not sure I approve. - He's a Jewish doctor. - Ooh, I love him ! Don't cock it up. Congratulations, Leo. We're so happy for you guys. Hey, thanks. We're just a bunch of old married folks now. Well, you are. Our marriage isn't recognized by the State of New York. Honey. You wanna dance ? Well, let's see about that, Rob. I'm carrying a boulder on my groin, and my feet have swollen twice their natural size. Yeah. Let's cut a rug, honey. Rosie, how come we've never gotten together ? Lady, quit trying to unhook my bra. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me ! Hi. Now it's time to toast the lovely couple. And who better to start things off than the most important person in Grace's life. Her friend, her confidant. And it pains me to admit this, but the most gorgeous man I know. Ladies and gentlemen, lease welcome to the stage, me ! Grace. Leo. What can I say about you two beautiful kids ? Except Acting is a craft which has been around for literally many, many years. And I should know. I'm Jack McFarland, creator of the McFarland Method, which has helped countless aspiring actors, actresses, and act-transgender individuals There's some very interesting people here. Just wait, mom. Now let's hear from another very important person in Grace's life. One who has been there for her through sick and sin. A great man, ladies and gentlemen Karen Walker. Thank you. Grace, Leon. This is truly a wonderful evening. See, folks. Some people do buy the cow. How 'bout that ? Thanks. Well, I am so, so happy for you both. Thank you, everyone. Man, there are a lot of Jews here. Thank you. Well, I guess that's everyone. So thank you for coming. Enjoy your m Hi. I remember the first time I met Grace. It was freshman year at Columbia. And I was pretty much like any other college guy. I lived in the dorm with the bare essentials futon, stereo, cast iron enamel fondue pot. Anyway, one night I was making up a batch for myself and my roommate Rob. I am not gay, everyone ! Do you hear that ? I love the ladies. I'm a breast man. So, um, the chocolate was just coming to a gentle boil, when this creature appeared at my door sniffing. I looked at her. She looked at the chocolate, and the two of them have been together ever since. I joke a lot about Grace, but well, truth is I couldn't be happier for her today. Leo I was the first man to ask her to marry me. And I know you're going to be the last. To you guys. Larry, you should get up and say something. They spoke at our wedding. That was a gay wedding. It didn't really count. - That joke isn't funny anymore. - It is to me. Hi. This reminds me of something my grandfather once said : "Where's that Jamaican woman who feeds me ?" I'm not very good at this. But someone who was, was Lord Byron, so I stole this from him. "The light of love, the purity of grace. The mind, the music breathing from her face, the heart whose softness harmonized the whole. That eye was in itself a soul." To my wife. Thank you. You know, I'm feeling so many things right now, it's hard to put them into words. So I thought I would express myself in a different way. Please don't let this feeling end it might not come again and I want to remember - Salads are out ! - What ? Oh, I don't I don't see salad. Oh, they're coming. Right, everybody ? I'll have one of those. Thank you. - What was that ? - I was just taking a mini quiche. I know what you were doing ! You were checking out that hussy. Well, let me tell you something, boy. Now that you're married, the only mini quiches you should be paying attention to are Grace's. You're a little bit scary, aren't you ? Listen to me, mister. If I hear that you have hurt my Gracie in any way, I will hurt you, yeah. I have people. I'm not gonna say who. But I do. Hello. Leo ! Time to cut the cake. Okay, everyone ! Come on up. Okay, you are the doctor. - I will follow your lead. - Okay, I'm not a doctor. I just said that so you'd marry me. - Well, he's kidding. - He better be. You want some - Oh, you wa - No, no, no, that's fine. Where are you kids going on your honeymoon ? We haven't really talked about it yet. You should take her to your cabin. - You have a cabin ? - Yeah, I go there to fish. - You fish ? - I learned in Africa. You were in Africa ? Yeah, when I was with Doctors Without Borders. You were with Doctors Without Borders ? Have you two met ? Let's give the newlyweds a break here. I'm sure they know all the important stuff. Like favorite song. Favorite movie. Birthdays ? No ? Doesn't matter. Don't worry, Grace. Marvin will fill you in on all that stuff. That's right, Eleanor. Who's Marvin ? That'd be me. - Your name is Marvin ? - Yeah, yeah. People always call me "Leo" 'cause my name's Marvin. You just married a guy, and you don't even know his name ? Silly. - I don't know your name ? - Come on, my first wife didn't have a problem with that. You were married before ? Wrong time to try that joke. Are you okay, baby ? Um, no, I'm Excuse me. Excuse me. I knew she'd cock it up. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~

Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 9 Marry Me A Little More (Part 2) sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Where are you going ? You're blowin' this way out of proportion. You're like a stranger to me Marvin. I might as well have married my Israeli pen pal from when I was 15 who sent me love letters on Hello Kitty stationary. Actually over there it'd be Shalom Kitty. Please don't joke right now. That was weird up there. I don't even know when your birthday is. Okay, you wanna know some stuff about me ? Here you go. I believe when I hold my breath, the guy on TV's going to make the basket. I'm in a Doors cover band, consisting entirely of surgeons called "The Operating Room Doors". And my deepest, darkest secret is that I don't like any food with raisins in it, but I do like raisins. See, we already have a problem. I love raisins. In everything ! I even went to see A Raisin in the Sun because I thought there'd be raisins in it. Grace, we have a whole lifetime to get to know each other, baby. I don't know. I don't know. I just wish that there was some way that we could be sure we were doing the right thing, you know. Just a sign, something. Katie ? Hi ! Crap. Hi ! Thanks for watching ! - Do you have your own pens ? - No, no, no. It's Grace and Leo. Remember, from the other day in the park. We got married because of you. Actually I got a colonoscopy because of you too. Not on the same day, though. And not in the park. - Eee, the wedding. Sorry about that. - What ? What do you mean ? No one called you ? Ooh, awkward. We're scrapping the whole wedding segment, because the judge performing the ceremony wasn't licensed in New York. So all those marriages are invalid. Last time I use Tom Brokaw's nephew as my fact checker. I guess I wanted a sign, and I think I got it. We're not married. We'll go to city hall tomorrow. We'll do it all over again. - I don't know that I can. - Why ? Why not ? - What's changed ? - Everything has changed. I mean, the first time I said yes, it was impulsive and romantic and to a guy named Leo. And now We know nothing about each other. I knew everything I needed to know about you the first time I held your hand. Grace, we're already married. The rest is paperwork. - How can you be so sure ? - Because when it's right, you just know. You remember Tuesday ? We woke up. I said, "Morning, wife". You said, "Hello, husband". Remember that ? Remember how great that was ? I want every day to be Tuesday. Every day can't be Tuesday. Today's Saturday, so it can't be Tuesday. Monday can't be Tuesday. Tuesday can't Well, Tuesday can, but Wednesday definitely can't be Tues Just come up with me. And I promise you everything is going to be fine. Please. I can't. I need time. I'm sorry. That was wild, wasn't it, Jackie ? The way Grace just kind of spooked and ran off. Kind of like Rosie whenever I fire my gun in her room just as she's falling asleep. Um, hi, everyone. I have a little bit of an announcement to make. Grace and I ran into Katie Couric in the lobby And she said that we weren't really married. Turns out the judge that married us wasn't really legit, so Anyway, we have this place till midnight, so stick around, you know. There's cake, there's booze, there's dancing. Well, have fun. I'm sorry. You okay ? I'm about as good as Bill Buckner of the '86 Red Sox. Ooh, ouch. I'm sorry. Do you even know what that means ? No, but anybody that's got 43 pairs of red socks obviously had issues. - Where's Grace ? - She took off. She she was pretty freaked out. Can I borrow your phone, man ? I think I need to call her. Uh, Leo, I think you might wanna give her some time right now. I know Grace. She's not like you. She's not impulsive. She once bought Impulse perfume and then returned it. That's why this whole getting married in the park thing all seemed so weird to me. Yeah, well, I guess I should send everyone home. Hi, it's me again. Listen, you're not going to like what you're about to hear. To be fair, he did say we wouldn't like what we were about to hear. - I thought you needed time to think. - I did. And I realized I want today to be Tuesday. It's Tuesday ? How long have I been out ? Okay. So our first wedding didn't take. But we're havin' another one ! And a real one this time. As for all these, ah, these lovely presents, I don't really know the protocol. Let's just call them engagement gifts. Bring another one at the wedding. Welcome to the wedding. Don't forget to sign the guest book. Okay, who wrote, "If it doesn't work out, call me." That's tacky. Don't forget to sign the guest book. Oh, perfect. I've been looking for this. - That's a little inappropriate ! - Please. This is inappropriate ? How about inviting people to watch a man and woman get married ? Look how good it makes my shoulders look. Well, Will. Congratulations. I think you've done a fantastic job at planning this wedding. I take my pants off to you. You've gotta be kidding me. The photographer's late. Four people who RSVP'd "no" just arrived with dates. And the cake shows up with two grooms on it. Is the whole city gay ? Not yet. But if all goes as planned, come Monday morning And look at these boutonnieres. Dead. - They're fine. - They're dead, my friend. Hey, hey, hey ! Sign that guest book ! Lady, you're a wreck ! But it's understandable. Today's a big day for you. You're not just losing a best friend, you're also losing a hag. She's not my hag, okay ? She's the most important person in my life, who used to be in love with me, and who for the last 15 years has never left my side. She's been a hell of a hag. - Hey, Will. - Hey. - Hey. Are you okay ? - Sure, why wouldn't I be ? 'Cause you're losing your girl. You're single again. Boy, I miss those days That can be arranged ! I'm joking ! I was joking. But if you know anyone. Knock, knock ! Oh, I'm here to see the daughter of the mother of the bride. Come on in, mom, for one minute. Now, Grace, I don't want you to freak out, but the biggest day of your life is ruined. What ? Well, your father's back went out. And he can't move. How is he going to walk me down the aisle ? Dear, I don't know. But we'll just put a pastrami sandwich and a TV Guide under the chuppah. He'll find his way. Honey. Have Will walk you down the aisle. Yeah, it'll be perfect. Out with the 'mo, in with the Jew ! Will'll love that. He looks so beautiful in his tux. He's not gonna be the most beautiful one there, is he ? Oh, honey, come on ! Don't be silly. That's crazy talk. I'll be there. Ladies, I said no poems. There he is. How you holdin' up ? You need a handshake ? I'm fine. I'm fine. Ellen, you make a beautiful bridesmaid. Eight months pregnant Look at the dress she picks for me. I hate that skinny bitch. Maybe you oughta skip the guest book. I know this is gotta be pretty hard on you. - It's not hard on me. - Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to really do my best to make Grace as happy as you have. Well, plus sex. What's the matter with everybody ? I'm fine. - Will ? - I'm fine ! Grace needs you in the dressing room. Oh, all right. - What ? - Come here, chica ! - You're not wearing that, are you ? - Well, it's white. Yeah, that's what I mean. I didn't think I was going to be so nervous. But I am. I'm doing the right thing, right ? - Well - What ? Nothing. No, I just I'm just saying As a friend, I want you to know that if you were thinking of calling it off, don't worry about the people out there. Don't worry about all those gifts. You do what your heart tells you is right. - Are you freaking kidding me with this ? - "If", I said "if". The question was rhetorical. That means you're supposed to say "yes". - That's not what "rhetorical" means. - Are we talking about what "rhetorical" means or about how you're freaking me out ? Am I supposed to answer that or is that rhetorical too ? Okay, I don't have time for this, Will. I have to get into my dress. Who says that ? "Don't worry about the people, don't worry about all the gifts". Who does that ? An ass, that's who ! It's a screen, not a soundproof booth. Oh, isn't that sweet ? Will's doin' her one last time before he hands her off to Leo. I just hope before I get married, he'll do the same for me. Ditto. Hey, Kar. Can I kiss you ? - Why ? - Just 'cause. Okay. All I'm trying to say I just - Look at it from my point - Don't ! Let me tell you something, mister. This wedding is going to happen. You better get on board, because you've gotta walk me down the aisle. - What ? - My dad threw his back out. He's bent over like he's trying to pick up a quarter, which is probably how he threw out his back to begin with. So I need you to walk me down the aisle. I can't do that. I'm running this show. I got a million things to attend to. Get Jack to do it. I'm not having Jack walk me down the aisle. He'll meet someone halfway down and ditch me ! - Well, then get Karen to do it. - Karen ? When was the last time she could walk a straight line ? Besides, I don't want them. I want you ! Well, I can't do it. All right ? What do you mean, you can't do it ? I need someone to give me away. You're my best friend. I want it to be you. It should be you. I don't wanna. You don't "wanna" ? Why not ? - Will ? - Look, Grace, I'll do a lot of things for you. I'll plan your wedding. I'll pick the florist. I'll even let you have input on your dress. But to actually be the one that that hands you off to another guy that I can't do. Groom coming in. I'm not looking. Just wanted to make sure everything was okay in here. People are starting to place bets. Apparently, you've walked out on one of these before. I didn't know about that, but that's cool. - Look, Leo - Oh, God. No. No, we're getting married. Just the thing is, Will and I need to take a little walk. So could you just stall them, just a little bit ? Sure, sure, yeah. Just as long as you remember that you and I have to take a little walk as well. I'm a little bit nervous about that track record of yours. You're gone, aren't you ? Okay, I guess this would be as good a time as any to tell you about that stripper at my bachelor party. Grace, what are we doing up here ? This is ridiculous. There is no way you're gonna talk me into this. Stop. Now let me talk, okay ? You know the story you always tell of when we first met ? The one that you told at the reception ? The fondue story ? I love how you tell it. It's a wonderful story. Well, I am a natural storyteller. - Yeah. Too bad it's crap. - What ? That was the second time we met. The first time was right here, on this roof, at Nancy Jacob's party. Nancy Ja No, no. - That was across from a juice bar. - Paradise Juice. Right over there, where that parking lot is. Oh, typical. They pave Paradise, and they put up a parking lot. - You were here ? - Yup. I thought you were the cutest guy I had ever seen. So I came up to you, and I asked for a drink. And you were so sweet, the way you held that funnel for me. And then I stumbled back to Nancy and I said, "That's the man I'm going to spend the rest of my life with". Well we say things when we're young. I said Human League would be bigger than the Beatles. Will, I may be getting married today, but when I said I was going to spend the rest of my life with you, I wasn't wrong. - Well, except - No. I wasn't wrong. - Now let's jump. - What ? Let's keep going, Thelma. You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar when I met you I picked you out and shook you up and turned you around, turned you into someone new Don't tell Leo I had the first dance.

I've also narrowed down what I'm gonna turn your room into. It's either gonna be a home office, a gym, or a gift-wrapping room, like Candy Spelling has. Ah, who am I kidding ? The bows and ribbons arrive tomorrow. This sucks. How come Grace gets to go to the Caribbean, and I don't ? Trust me, poodle. You don't wanna go. Two Jews on a beach ?

Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 10 The Honeymoon's Over sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ That gift-wrapping room's like the best thing ever. I don't know how I existed without it. I was always losing the scissors and spreading the wrapping paper out on the floor like an animal. Yeah. Okay And exchange. Oh, my God ! Smart Start ! And milk. Always the perfect gift. It's so much more fun eating breakfast this way. I know. Hurry up, we've only got two hours to gift wrap lunch. - Um, sweetheart ? - Yes, bunny ? I think I'm gonna need my allowance a little early this week. Well, I thought you were doing well teaching your acting class. 'Twas. But, um, I had to kick a student out. Yeah. Phillip wasn't willing to do what it takes to become a great actor. - He wouldn't make out with you ? - All I wanted was a little Mr. French ! He got all crazy when I told him. Started hissing and spraying everywhere. He even told me he was gonna sic the gay mafia on me. Right, the gay mafia. Or as I like to call it, really organized crime. Yeah, what are they gonna do ? Measure me for concrete sneaker clogs ? They gonna make you a coiffure you can't refuse ? I don't get that one. Hey, Sam. Hey, Diane. Hey, someone's got a little spring in their step. You just get a bikini wax ? I don't know. People were moving around down there I assume something was getting done. Funny, Jack said the same thing about his last dentist appointment. Ah listen, kids. I need your help. I'm in a little bit of a pickle. You know how I'm into Aerosmith, right ? - Yeah. - Sure, go ahead. I went to see 'em play at Madison Square Garden and invited 'em back to my suite at the Palace Hotel to party with me. - Aerosmith ? - No, Madison Square Garden. Anyhoo Some things may have been set on fire. A bellboy may have been stripped and shaved. A young girl may have become a mother. Bottom line They kicked me out. And no hotel in New York will have me. And I need a place to stay. Well, you know, I'd let you bunk with me, but they're gonna be shooting "Sex and the City" in my apartment all week ! Yeah, in fact, I gotta go baby-proof it. In case Sarah Jessica brings little James Wilke Jessica Broderick Parker. So, I guess that leaves No, no, no. No, you cannot stay here. Why don't you move in with one of your hallucinations ? All right, okay. I see what this is gonna take. Ooh, yeah. It's good to be bad, isn't it, daddy ? Whoo ! Karen, I'd ha What Okay, all right, all right. Stop it ! You can stay here But just till we work things out with the Palace. I don't know if you hypnotized me with those things or what, but I'm not afraid of flying anymore. Hey. What time does the gal come by to turn down the bed ? Karen, this is not a hotel. No one will be turning your bed down. And I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't keep filling up my answering machine with complaints about room service. Since you bring it up, when I checked in, the soaps had all been opened, and the shower cap had been used. Karen, I am trying to catch up on some work here. Okay ? I've got an SEC filing that's months overdue, a product liability case that's going to trial, and, most importantly of all, the firm's annual potluck dinner is coming up, and I don't want three people bringing salads, like last year's fiasco. Fine, I'll leave you alone. It's not unusual to be loved by anyone. - It's not unusual to be loved by - Karen ! Quiet ! Quiet. Jeez Louise ! It's just a little top 40. Well, if you must do that, put the headphones on. Oh, fun. If you ever want to be loved by anyone. It's not unusual, it happens every day. No matter what you say, you see it happens all the Where you going ? I'm just about at the bridge. I can't believe I sacrificed my gift-wrapping room for you. And right around the holidays ! Morning, morning, morning. Remember we were making those jokes about the gay mafia ? - I think it's for real. - Of course it is. I'm sure some gay guy's getting whacked as we speak. This is serious. I think that guy I kicked out of my acting class sent them after me. I mean, look at this. That's awful. What am I looking at ? Hello ? Dry, unmanageable hair. I just got back from the salon, the center of gay culture. The shampoo boy said he was gonna put conditioner in, but I think he just went like this Well, that's all the proof I need. And check this out, check this out. "Sex and the City", supposed to shoot all week in my apartment ? Then for no reason They pulled out. - What does that have to do with anyth - Do I have to spell it out ? "Sex and the City," HBO, H-O-M-O. - What do I do, Will ? What do I do ? - Okay, here's the plan. Call Dorothy, tell her to meet you at the Yellow Brick Road. When you get to the end of the road, you'll see a man. Ask him for a brain. Oh, Will, you would have loved this hotel. They had parasailing and scuba diving. You could go in a Jeep and scour cave walls for markings made by the indigenous peoples. Cool. What did you do ? There was a bar in the pool. I swear, swimming any other way than drunk is just stupid. Oh, and the sunsets. Amazing. I took, like, seven rolls of film just on that. You know, let's open up a bottle of wine and I'll walk you through 'em. Hey, you open the wine, I'll open the oven door and climb in. Hi, are you alone ? Did anybody follow you up here ? Uh, how about, "Welcome back from your honeymoon" ? Yeah, whatever, who cares. Listen, I got bigger problems, all right ? The gay mafia's put a hit out on me. What is a gay hit ? "It's Raining Men" ? This is serious ! They're everywhere. They control everything. Who do you think prevented that 'NSync guy from going into space ? I gotta go. I gotta go. "It's not unusua it's not unusua It's not " Well, this is unusual. What the hell happened here ? Karen ? Grace Adler Designs. I don't remember giving permission for a party ! It wasn't a party. You guys know how I'm into gangsta rap, right ? - Sure, go on. - All I did was invite Ol' Dirty Bastard over to watch Masterpiece Theatre. And he brought along his whole posse. And some bomb-ass chronic. Heh-heh ! Would you look at this place ? These cushions are ruined. There's beer rings all over the coffee table. Great, they broke my novelty pen from last year's Gay Games. Now when you turn it, the high-diver's Speedo doesn't come off. What am supposed to do with this pen now ? - I have a suggestion. - I heard that ! - All right, calm down. - Don't you tell me to calm down ! Hey, can we please not do this in front of the D-R-U-N-K ? - Can I have my martini now ? - No ! No dessert ! - Will, she's hungry. - Tough ! She's gotta learn that there are consequences to her actions ! So you are gonna sit there, on this couch, and look at Grace's honeymoon pictures ! I hate you ! Roll one. My luggage. Which brings us to roll three. Getting kicked out of the first class lounge. Oh. Hey, Grace. Hey, Leo. Listen, you mind if I talk to your wife alone for a minute ? You come to Long Island, you can talk to her any time you like. Hey, Kare, what's up with all the luggage ? Oh, nothing, honey. I just came by to look at all of your honeymoon pictures. Okay, now I know something's wrong. What happened ? - I don't wanna live with Will anymore. - Why ? He has no sense of humor. He didn't laugh at all when that M-80 went off in his toilet. Well, he can get like that. So, what are you gonna do ? Oh, no problem. I'm just gonna move in with you. Problem ! Hey. Look what showed up on my doorstep. Was she in a basket with a note pinned to her that said, "Please take care of my baby. Love, Lucifer" ? We've got a problem. She needs a place to stay. - Why can't she stay with you and Leo ? - Come on, we're newlyweds. We wanna be able to have sex without someone in the background giggling. Honey, I won't giggle if you don't make that face you make. Will, come on. Come on, she's in a really bad way. - You have to take her. - I don't want her. - Neither do I. - What are we gonna do ? We can't just drive her out to the country and release her back into the wild. Or can't we ? Just think about it. We can lure her into a cage with a Vicodin tied to the end of a little piece of string. If her friends ask, we just say, "We took her to farm where she can run free and have waiters fired." Come on, let's get serious. Where's she gonna go ? Where did she go ? This is crazy. We're not gonna find Karen. She could be anywhere. She's got four fake passports and a map of the underworld. We've gotta keep looking for her. She's out there all alone. The city's full of criminals and murderers. She could hurt one of them. - Maybe we should call the police. - No. No cops. But she's in a bad place. We can't find her I said no cops ! I'm gonna go ask around, see if anyone's seen her. Keep it on the down-low. Come on. Let's get a drink. Make it a double. We wanna catch Karen, we've gotta drink like her. - Could you pass those nuts ? - No problem. - Jack ? - Sorry, nope. - Jack, we know it's you. - No, it is not me ! My name is Claude Remains. I have dark glasses. I'm from Indiana. - Look, I have a mustache. - Not anymore. I can't believe you just did that ! Just hand me over to the gay mafia, the homo nostra, Don Queerleone. So that's what this is about ? You're hiding ? Yes, Toby's meeting me here. He borrowed his mother's Caprice and he's gonna smuggle me to Oklahoma. - You're going to Oklahoma ? - Yes. The matinee. We're heading out. We'll see you later ? - No, they're after me. - Enough of that crap ! No one's after you. It's all in your head. - Your fish, sir. - But I didn't order Oh, my god ! It's a message. I'm a dead man ! I'm gonna sleep with the fishes ! But it's the gay mafia, so I'm gonna sleep with trout almandine drizzled with lemon and capers ! I don't know where else to look for her. We checked the Gun Club, the FDA testing center, Bill Clinton's office in Harlem She's nowhere. - Was he checking me out ? - No, Grace. Oh, my God. Look. Karen ? What are you doing ? Nothing, just shooting the breeze with these three Rosarios. Now leave me alone. Look, we're really sorry. I know we said some pretty harsh things. We forget sometimes that you have human feelings. You do, right ? You know, you could be a little more sensitive. This divorce hasn't exactly been easy for me. I know. You and Stan were together a long time. What ? Stan ? Who said anything about One Ton Phooey ? - Yours is the divorce I'm upset about. - What ? You two split up without even a thought as to how it would affect me. Hey, I know she's no prize. And I know she's no prize, either. But couldn't you two have stayed together for my sake ? Karen What ? Don't you get it ? It was always me, you, and Will. It was ? As long as you were together, I felt safe, taken care of, special. I just don't know where I fit in anymore. Karen. No matter what happens between us, nothing could ever change the way we feel about you. - Really ? - Of course, Karen. We love The way we feel about you. So we're a family again ? As much as we ever were. So we're clear on this, right ? You understand there is no gay mafia ? There is no network of waiters and florists and cabaret singers who carry out the commands of some shadowy don. Or, in this case, eye-shadowy don. Yeah, okay. Yeah, whatever. Doesn't matter, anyway. I let Phillip back in my class because he is a talented actor and is under no obligation to make out with me. Did you hear that ? Phillip's back in, pass it on. Jack ! Enough ! There is no gay mafia. It does not exist. I do not know this man ! We are not here together. After you pay the check Leave me alone ! Gay mafia. I'm surrounded by idiots. - Oh, man ! My new Gucci suit ! - Sorry, sir. Hey, it's not funny. It's a little bit funny. Oh, my God. You're You're you. That's right, and next time it'll be red wine. A word of advice, Will. Don't dismiss things you know nothing about. And don't walk in ten-inch heels It's hell on the ankles. What are you talking about ? There is no such thing Isn't there ? Well, even if there was, it's not like they control the Don't they ? Come on. - It's not like you're the - Aren't I ? Listen, Will. You're a smart boy. You've got a good face. A flat stomach. I'd hate to see you banned from every gym in America. And what ? End up in a Fitness Protection Program ? Don't joke. It's real. So watch yourself, Will. 'Cause we're watching you. One wrong move, and this bitch will be back. Could you give me $2.00 for the coat check girl ? Okay, I'll ask her. I'm on with the manager of the Palace Hotel. They're willing to take you back, as long as you're willing to return the concierge's prosthetic leg. No ! I won that leg fair and square. Besides, I need it to hit the snooze button in the morning. Why don't you just sleep on the other side of the bed ? Hey ! All right. Oh. But Um tell him two of the toes broke off. Did you hear that ? Two of the toes broke off Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			Beautiful. Now you do me. - Hey, Prancer. - Hey, Vixen. Hey, Blitzed. Oh, good, just in time. Can I put the star on ? 'Cause I got a really good one this year. Now the other ornaments have something to aspire to. Yes, look at it there. Shining like a beacon of unemployment. So, Wilma, now that you've gotten rid of the old ball and chain, got any Christmas Eve plans ? Oh, yeah. I'm gonna spend the whole evening by myself. Yeah. I'm gonna string cranberries around the tree, get in my jammies, and watch every version of A Christmas Carol ever made. And which one do you think you'll be watching when you kick the chair out from under you ? Hey, there's a difference between being alone and being lonely. I am lonely. Honey, why don't you join Jackie and me in my suite at The Palace Hotel ? It's gonna be a real old fashioned Christmas. The stockings will be hung by the chimney with care. And I'll be stinking drunk. And then at midnight, we're going to crawl into bed and wait for the sound of hooves on the rooftop. No, honey, Rosie's not invited. - So what do you say ? - And pass up my annual screening of Ebbie, starring Susan Lucci as the definitive female Scrooge ? Yeah, I'll be there at 6:00. Maybe we should invite Grace and Leo. - Oh, I already invited them. - What ? Before me ? No ! Come on, crazy ! After I invited you ! Merry Christmas ! Grace and Leon ! Hey, feliz navi-dude. Hey. We just came by to try some of your famous Christmas cookies. Grace has been talking about 'em all week. Oh, I don't bake those till tomorrow. - See ya. - Wait. Will, we brought you something for your tree. What ? I thought you were against the whole tree thing 'cause you're Jewish. Well, it's your place now. I'm not gonna impose my beliefs on you. Oh. A star of David. What ? Who is this David ? He's completely stolen my idea. We got it as a wedding gift. Next Christmas you're getting a Seder plate. Um, Karen, you know, I know we told you a couple of weeks ago we were going to your thing at The Palace, but - A couple of weeks ago ! - After you. But we're not gonna be able to make it 'cause we got tickets The Nutcracker. I am so jealous ! How did you get tickets for Christmas Eve ? I've been calling every day since June. That information does not leave this room. You know, it's kind of ironic, actually. I treated a guy who took a puck to the groin during a pick-up hockey game, and he gave me two tickets to The Nutcracker. Yeah, it'd be even more ironic if the ballet were called "Crap, Now I Can't Have Kids". Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 11 All About Christmas Eve sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Okay, you guys, are you ready ? - On the count of three. One - I don't know about this. - Two - Really, guys. Three ! Merry Christmas, New York ! That was fun ! I'm glad I put a bow on, it was a more festive message. Hey, we got a nibble. Some loser across the way spending Christmas in his bathrobe's checking us out. Hey, look ! He's hot and he's waving. Come on, let's put up our stockings before Santy gets here. What ? I made it myself. My home ec teacher said I was a needlepoint prodigy. In fact, I was the only guy to have a piece in the statewide needlepoint competition. Well, the only guy who's still a guy. He's here. Santa's here ! Hey, you're not Santa Claus. Close, though. You got a couple of white hairs sproutin' outta your chin, and you look like you just came down the chimney. We'd make a good team. Your nose is so red you could guide my sleigh tonight. - Merry Christmas, honey. - You too, babe. Hi, G ! Hey, Kare, come help me stretch out my stocking. I don't want Santa to think I have small feet. Heh heh What's going on ? I thought you'd be on your way to The Nutcracker. Leo got beeped. All the Jewish doctors have to be on call for Christmas. In other words, all the doctors have to be on call for Christmas. So How would you like to come with me to The Nutcracker ? I can't. I've got plans with Jack and Karen. Ditch 'em. Come on. I'm having fun. I'm wearing a bow under here. Come on, come on, it's The Nutcracker. You have loved this story ever since you were a little kid. I know. I used to go to sleep in my suit the night before. I'd get up the next morning and spend two hours getting my hair just right. - How nobody knew - Okay, tick-tock. No, I can't. I'm having fun. I respect them too much to do that to them. Oh, look, I think he's coming ! I see Santa's crack ! I'll get changed. Oh, that was intense ! What was that smell ? That was not just B.O. That was B-O-My-God ! What was the scent that air freshener ? Onion and feet ? - Hey, Will. Hey, Grace. - Hey, Steve. What are you doing ? Going to see the ballet. I have a date. Ooh, good for you. It's my mom. Oh Well, that can still be fun. I don't think she's gonna show. Between you and me I love my husband, but I'm glad he's not here. I wouldn't want to spend tonight any other way. - Grace ! - Leo ! - Hi. What happened ? - It turns out they just beeped me 'cause they wanted to know if they could eat the sesame noodles I left in the fridge. I threw a big fit last time 'cause somebody ate my lemon Yoplait. Had my name on it and everything. - Let's go to the show. - Yay ! Oh. So this is weird. Leo just showing up, and us having only two tickets. - I suppose you want me to - Would you mind ? No. It's Christmas. Consider it my gift to you. Although you will have to give back the other gift I gave you. I'm serious. - Get in there. Have fun. - Thanks, Will. You're a prince. The next holiday is yours. New Year's Well, no. Valen Ok. I have three words for you : you, me, Purim. Oh, Jackie, look at all this food. We are so blessed. I know. There are poor people who dream their whole lives of a meal like this. Honey, I know what we should do. Let's take a picture of us eating and show it to them. Karen, you are like a female Jesus. Oh, great, the food's here. I'm gonna clean up, get in my robe. Tie my boys in a bow, and I'll be ready. What the hell are you doing here ? What are you talking about ? I've been here the whole time. I thought I could have fooled one of you with that. Leo showed up. Is that eggnog ? Hey, hey, Rudeness Giuliani ! You can't just use us, toss us aside, and then waltz back in here and expect us to forgive everything. We are not sleeping together. Yeah, take off, Mary. There's no room at the inn. All right, look, I shouldn't have left. I really was having a good time. And I want to be here now. Please ? Okay, we will consider letting you back in, - but you're gonna have to work for it. - What do I have to do ? Pleasure us ! Fast and nasty. And extra points if you can find a way to work in that shoeshine mitt. There isn't a mitt big enough. Okay, option B. You must recite 'Twas the Night Before Christmas to us. - Well, I can do that. - But you must substitute every fifth word with the word "heinie". And give a little kick like a Rockette. 'Twas the night before heinie And all through the heinie Not a creature was heinie Not even a mouse Heinie I love that we got hot buttered rum. It's so Christmassy. Yeah. It's the perfect little $80 treat before seeing The Nutcracker. Cheers. What the hell is this crap ? I know It tastes like warm rum with butter in it. Ugh. I'm so glad we came early so we could soak up the Christmas feeling. I just love looking at the little kids all dressed up, sharing a special night with their family. Peter, I swear to God. You poke her one more time, and the next book you'll be reading is Harry Potter and the Forty-Five Minute Spanking. - Can I have a hot buttered rum ? - I should warn you, they're awful. I don't care. Hopefully, Santa can swing by Child Services. Aw, damn it. Sweetie, I got some bad news. Someone's trying to break into your pants ? No, no. It's Mrs. Schuler. And I gotta go because she's having kidney failure. Christmas Eve ? Doesn't she have two kidneys ? One of them's given up, and the other one's living with her sister in Florida. - You gonna be okay ? - Yeah. I'll meet you home later. Okay. I'll bring you something from the hospital. You like gauze ? Bye. Hey, Grace. You alone ? Oh, um I think I am. Did your mom ever show ? Yeah. Too bad, otherwise you and I coulda hooked up. You do know I'm married ? So was my ex-wife, but it didn't stop her. Oh, I am full. I cannot drink another bite. I think I ate too much, too. I'm gonna have to undo the bellhop's pants. Now don't poop out on me, we still have to go caroling. You gotta be kidding. I'm stuffed. If I open my mouth to sing, half a bird would fly out. Honey, this is The Palace. We don't have to go out to carol. Come in ! Here's the ice you asked for. Oh, yes, just put it right over here, bellman. Good king Wenceslas looked out on the feast of Stephen When the snow lay roundabout, deep and crisp and even. - Just the boys ! - Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came inside, Gathering winter fuel Thank you, bellman. That'll be all. Oh, isn't that fun ? 'S open ! - Problem with the heater ? - Oh, yes, electrician. The dial's on 74, but we'd like it on 73. Just hear those Sleigh bells jingling, ding-ding-dingling too. Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you. Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling yoo-hoo ! All done ! Thanks, honey. How 'bout that ? You know, this is a lot like the first Christmas. Except we did get a room, none of us are virgins, and instead of the baby Jesus, we have a plate of cheeses. - Hello ? - Hey. Hey, listen, Leo got beeped again. So great news, you get to be my date again. - Turndown service. - Hold on a second. I'll get it. - Come, they told me - pa rum pa pum pum So, can you be here in, like, ten minutes ? 'Cause they're blinking the lights. - No, you can't keep doing this to me. But you love The Nutcracker. You've loved it since you were a kid. You've been calling for tickets since June. I said that was not to leave the room ! We're on an unsecured cell phone here. Oh, it's The Nutcracker, Will. Remember your childhood ? The beautiful music, the magical story, the funny feeling you got in your pants every time the tin soldiers lifted each other ? I do love a toy in uniform. But, no, I can't, no. It's snowing again. I'll never get a cab. Then run, Will. Run through the snow. Run to The Nutcracker. Run to that stirring in your pants ! I'll be there as fast as I can. - Uh, guys, listen. - What ? You're ditching us again ? I'm sorry. Okay, this one's gonna cost you, Wilma. In order for us to forgive you, you'll perform the following task You must sing the "Twelve Days of Christmas". I can do that. As the Count, from "Sesame Street". On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me That's one, one day ! Oh, Will, you made it. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Better thank me. It's freezing out there. I ran past the Zoo, and two polar bears were fighting over a pashmina. God, I love you for doing this. And tonight is all about you and me. - Grace ! - Leo ! - Oh, come on ! - What are you doing here ? I got another doctor to cover for me. You have to make out with his wife at the New Year's party and let him videotape it, but I made it. - Will, what are you doing here ? - I'm going to The Nutcracker. - What are you doing here ? - I am avoiding an awkward situation by going to go pee pee. Well, here it comes. Go ahead, blow me off. You know you're gonna do it. I can't believe you're blowing me off ! I changed my plans for you, not one time, but two times tonight. One, two, two times. Damn ! It's gonna be stuck in my head till New Year's. - How could you ? - I don't know what else to do. Is this how it's gonna be from now on ? When he can't make it tosomething, I'm expected to show up. The moment he's back, I'm out ? Will, when you say it like that, you make it sound like You understand exactly what's happening. I'm sorry, but he's my husband. Look, I knew things were gonna change when you got married, okay ? I just never realized that that things were gonna change when you got married. Enjoy the show. Hey, you guys work it out ? 'Cause, you know, I could go read the playbill and count the male dancers who thank their partner, "Ted". You know what, sweetie ? I'm sorry, but I've already made plans with Will. I didn't know that you were coming back. I sort of pulled him out of his Christmas plans, so I Hey, it's okay. I understand. Hey, you better hurry up, it's starting. You don't want to miss the almonds and pecans battling for the City of Macadamia. I have no idea what this show's about. Thanks, hon. Okay, come on. Have fun. Hi. Just out of curiosity, how come your hot buttered rums are so bad ? Just forget it. I'll take another one. Leo. This isn't right. You should be in there with your wife. Go on in. You made a sacrifice to be here, you go. - You go. - No, you. Leo, look. I'm just gonna have to accept that things are different now that you and Grace are married. I can deal with it now or I can deal with it later. I might as well deal with it now. Yeah. You don't wanna see it, do you ? Please don't make me. I mean, I'm in there five seconds, and the toys start to come to life. Man, the toys come to life ? I know. It was great when I was a kid, but as an adult you think, "That couldn't happen !" Please, go in there. No, I ain't watching no dancing toys. You go. Well, we can't just leave Grace alone. Somebody's gotta sit with her. My mom got a better offer. Looks like I'm flying solo. Oh, the weather outside is frightful, but the fire is so delightful, and since we've no place to go, Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping, and I've got some corn for popping. The lights are down way down low, Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~

And they're out. It's beautiful. It's like a butt. What's the occasion ? Whadaya talk ? I'm dressed like I always am. And I resent your implication that I have some kind of hidden agenda. Hello. Karen, that's three nights this week. I'm either incredibly flattered or worried that you're from the health department. See you brought your friends. Thanks for noticing. Ah, yes. And this is Red, Homo, Homo, and Boy. Welcome, I'm Milo. If you need anything, I'm here to serve you. Actually, the waiters are here to serve you. I'm here to overcharge you. It's nice to see you. Now I know why we're here. You like him ! Shut up ! Shut up ! He's cute. You should ask him out. What ? You mean like on a date ? Oh, I don't know. I've been married to Stan for so long, the last time I was on a date, Bush was president and we were about to go to war with Iraq. Don't worry, Kare. It's like riding a bicycle Only you're naked. And the seat's off. You can't borrow my bike anymore. Karen, go ahead, ask him. He was totally giving you the green light. You think ? Yeah, even I saw it, and I'm unconscious. - Go, go, go. Get over there. - Yeah. Yeah. - How do I look ? - Here, let me see. Make up : flawless. Hair : fabulous. Breasts I'm jealous. Now go. All right, if I'm not back in ten minutes, you can have my drink. Oh, God, what am I saying ? That's crazy. Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 12 Field Of Queens sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Ah, look at her. She's all flirty and shy. Like a teenage girl. Yeah. Are you there, God ? It's me, Satan. Hey, guess what ? While we were at Elliot's game, I signed us up for a gay soccer team. - What ? - Now, before you pee-pee it Just take a moment and think about it. It might be fun. What ? Forget it. No, I don't do sports. I mean, sure I'll flip through a Sports Illustrated if it's already in the bathroom and I'm already happy to see it. But that's where I draw the line. Gay soccer isn't sports, silly. It's cute guys in shorts runnin' around kickin' balls. It's a gay bar on astro-turf. You know, you should do it. You might meet someone. And you do like the way your legs look in shorts. I really do. But I don't know. Soccer ? I mean, what color are the uniforms ? Powder blue with white accents and lemon piping - Cotton ? - Cotton-poly blend, - very shiny, lotta movement. - Sounds cute. Ooh, ooh, I can wear my tinted lenses. I'm in. I was thinking, maybe sometime You and I could I don't Taste this. So it's not spoiled ? Oh, you're fun. You wanna You wanna go out sometime ? - You'd go out with me ? - Why wouldn't I ? You're charming and handsome and sexy. Oh, so you picked up on that ? I'd love to. Oh, um By the way, you just took two of my amphetamines. Huh. Maybe we should warm up too. I call the blonde in blue I saw him before you - You the new guys ? - Hi. I'm Jack, that's Will. - I'm Kirk, the captain. - Oh, so you're Captain Kirk. Who do we play first, the Romulans or the Klingons ? All right, listen up. We're gonna run a few drills, then we're gonna break into teams and do a quick scrimmage. All right, ladies. Let's go, let's go. What ? Play ? Now ? Well, don't worry. Like you said, it's gay soccer. We'll probably just run over there and compare Tony predictions. - I think it's going to be Hairspray. - Save it for the game. Everyone was running and kicking and pushing each other over. It's supposed to be gay soccer. Where were the lingering hugs, the affectionate ass pats ? The catchy team theme song ? Can't believe you didn't do better. You're so athletic. Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. Look at my nose ! My whole face is thrown off now. It's completely asymmetrical. I'm like a Picasso. Or-or-or Shannen Doherty. Oh, I'm sure you'll do better the next time. There ain't gonna be no next time, I quit. I'm turning in my uniform. Actually, I'm turning it into a tank top. It just looks better without the sleeves. Don't sew when you're this angry. Worst of all, Jack is like a superstar. The guy can't figure out when to step off an escalator, but he's a genius with a soccer ball. Will someone talk to this kid ? He's thinkin' about quitting the team. Yeah, because I'm awful. They even have a new nickname for me on the team Awful. I give up. I throw up my hands and jut out my hip. You know what, when I was your age, there were a lot of kids who said I couldn't kiss. But did I quit kissing ? I did not. I stuck with it. I made out with every guy who would have me. And today Not you, Whora Flynn Boyle ! He needs to hear it from someone who understands, someone who's as bad as he is. Will. - What ? - Go talk to him. - I'm not going to - Yeah. Shh Go talk to him. Okay, Elliot, look. Some of my biggest regrets are the things that I didn't follow through on. You know, like when I gave up the role of Kenickie in my high school production of Grease, because I was afraid to jump off the car during "Grease Lightning". Do you think a day goes by where I don't think about that ? God, I hope so. You see, he learned his lesson. That's why you don't see him quittin' our team. Even though he stinks so bad that I, his best friend, am forced to make jokes behind his back. Yeah, Will, you're sticking with it even though you suck ? Yes, I am. Wow, well, then then I guess I can do that too. Thanks. You know, that car was really high up, and I don't think a little stepladder would've made my move any less dramatic. Morning, campers. So how was your date ? I didn't hear from you all weekend ! Well, honey, I wanted to call you, but I lost your number. And do you know how many "Grace Johnsons" there are in the phone book ? Come on ! We want details. Was he sweet ? Was he charming ? Does he have a gay brother ? Or better yet, does he have a straight brother who drinks a lot ? Oh, kids. It was amazing. We talked. We laughed. He walked me home. He was such a gentleman. He opened the door for me. I opened my shirt for him. He gave me a little kiss, and we said good night. Karen and Milo sittin' in a tree. K- I-S-I-N-G Wait So, when you gonna see him again ? 'Cause you know, it's all about the second date, or as I like to refer to it, "The date when you can slowly let your stomach out". - Well, uh, he said he would call. - But it's been three days. Oh, look who's suddenly a math whiz. Oh. Well. What d'ya know ? Hello ? I bet you do. Who was it ? Someone looking for a designer. I didn't catch their name. You know I feel moody. I think I'm gonna go change my blood. Into a Bloody Mary. - He's gonna call, right ? - Absolutely. Truman. I didn't think you'd come back. Well I was gonna quit, but I wanna set an example for a young friend of mine. I'm trying to show him that sticking with something, even though you're not good at it, is its own reward. Well, if you really want me to put you in the game God, no ! I don't want to play ! What are you gonna do ? Sit on the sidelines with your needlepoint ? Nooo. I brought a picnic basket. Okay, princesses, huddle up. Okay, these guys are tough. But if we can beat this hetero team, we may one day achieve our dream of beating the lesbians. All right, now come on. Let's wipe the field up with these candy-ass breeders. Neiman Marcus ! - Sorry you're not gonna play. - Don't you worry about me. You just get out there and win one for the lisper. I think I'll start with olive tapenade on a bagel chip. - Finally, tonight - Hey. I wanna talk to you. We have a roasted tomato vegetable - May I finish here, please ? - Fine. Finish. Soup. You are just a real charmer, aren't ya ? What's next ? You get them to take their shirts off and then don't call them ? Well, I tried that with table number five, but it sort of ruined their anniversary. Who are you ? Figures you wouldn't remember. Red. Of Red, Homo, Homo, and Boy. Karen Walker's friend. Right. So how is Karen ? Well, if you picked up a phone, you'd know. Or is that not your style ? You know, guys like you just drive me Is that pie ? Yes, but we call it a galette. That way we can charge $18 for it. - Would you like to try it ? - No, I wouldn't. But I'll take a piece to go. How dare you treat Karen like that ? - And how does this concern you ? - I'm her friend and a woman. And I'm here on behalf of all women. Except her. She's on her own. How do you expect to earn anyone's trust, if you don't keep your word ? Could we believe anything you say ? I mean, look, it says that the special of the night is monkfish cooked in a saffron sauce. Is it ? Or is it just a giant turd cooked in poison ? It's not. Look, I am trying to run a business here. - You said you would call her. - Yes, and that made her happy. She went home thinking that I was still interested. She also went home thinking people work in toll booths because they have tails. What do you mean, you're not interested in her ? I mean, what's wrong with her ? Well, first of all she's a little old for me. She's exactly your age. That's what I'm saying, she's a little old for me. And when I kissed her good night, I just didn't feel anything. Listen, mister, I've kissed Karen more times than I can count. And every single time, I felt somethin'. Perhaps it was you. Let's investigate. - You're a pig ! - Oh, so you picked up on that ? - You know what ? - What ? This little playboy shtick of yours is gettin' old. You know someday, very soon, you're gonna wake up, and you're gonna find yourself very alone. Well, maybe not very soon. But it's gonna happen. Good day. Milo said that I could have a piece of pie. And a Cornish game hen. I'll be outside. Look's pretty tasty. Way to hustle. Oh, thank you. Lorna Doone ? - I'll take some of that. - Don't you have a game today ? Uh, yeah, probably starting right about now. I quit. What ? What happened to sticking with something, with not quitting just because it's hard ? You know ? I thought we had a good talk the other night. I thought I was a role model for you. I see you, like, once every eight months. Still I ever saw you as a quitter. You know, I mean, look at me. I'm no good at this, but here I am working my ass off just just waitin' to get in there. Waitin' ! Truman, Carlo's hurt. - I'm hurt ! - Get in there. What ? But-but-but I'm picnicking. Can't you send someone else, like-like this kid ? No way, man. You're my role model. You're in, Truman. Wrap that biscotti in parchment paper and get out there. But I just dipped it in espresso ! McFarland ! I know Betty McUseless is your friend, but don't pass to him. If we win, we get free facials at Sonya Dakar. - And a basket of scented candles. - Oh, my God I'm not about to blow that. - Hey, Karen. - Oh, Grace. You've been awfully quiet. I've been gone for two hours. You're funny. Uh, listen, I don't mean to sound negative, and I shouldn't because I'm taking six different pills so I won't, but Uh, do you think it's weird that Milo hasn't called ? Sweetie, I don't think he's gonna call. Why ? Look, I didn't want to tell you this because I was afraid it would hurt your feelings, but Milo is sick. Sick ? Oh, my gosh, I better call him. No, no, no, no, no. He can't talk to you because he's, uh, he's he's had his throat removed. Doy ! Well, that explains it. Well, wait a minute then, what's holding up his head ? Good question. Yeah, I asked the same thing. Um, there's this stick-like apparatus. I'm familiar And the head is propped on Karen, I just came from over there, and Milo doesn't want to see you anymore. He just is He doesn't like the Karen, he just doesn't see how wonderful you are. And I know that's hard cause this is the first date that you've had in a long time, but But don't let it put you off, because someone out there will. Well, thanks, honey. But I'm a big girl, I can take it. Tell me what he said. He said you were too old. Oh. Well, now I'm glad his head's on a stick. You know, it's strange how things have changed for the two of us over the last year. I'm a married lady giving out dating advice. Now you're the single girl, starting your life over. - I like it. - I hate it. I know you do. Here I am. I'm the mean machine. I'm fast and lean. I'm What rhymes with lean ? Penis ? I just said penis. What am I doing again ? Oh, soccer ! Right. How did the Q-Tip miss that ? Oh, look at him. Lonely girl. I should pass to him. It'd make him feel good. Don't pass it to me. Please, if there's a God, do not pass it to me. Oh, god, it's coming to me Run away ! Uh, I like being carried. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~

I though you were coming to visit me ! We were just leaving. We we're on our way. We're there. Where are you ? Hello ? Thanks a lot. You know, Brooklyn is where I live now.

Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 13 Fagmalion Part One Gay It Forward sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Yes ! Leo, all my stuff is unpacked and the boxes are gone. I know finally. Yes, that's a lie. But, I promise you I will only lie about the insignificant things. Yes, that's another lie. I'll see you later tonight, okay ? I'll have a nice dinner waiting. Yes, that is too. - Who is it ? - Your neighbor. I brought you a housewarming gift. It's a cat. Her name's Pees-On-My-Bed, but feel free to change it to Pees-On-Your-Bed. Thanks, but, um, I'm allergic. Oh, well that's ok. She's a rescue, she didn't expect much out of life. I'll just go drown her in the tub with the others. What ? No ! Kidding. I'm jus trying to guilt you. Go home, baby. God ! You have huge feet too. I like that. Yeah. I waited my whole life to develop, and those are the only things that grew. - I'm Julie. - Grace. - Adler. - Adler. I know. The old ladies upstairs told me. By the way, that's where all your magazines are. Interesting. Well, the next time Mrs. Rabinowitz fights me for a cab, boom. She's going right down. Oh. You're dark. Leo needs that. You know, we have a nickname for him in the building : "Wish I were doing him instead of my husband". You have no boundaries. I like that. So, do you need a hand unpacking ? I'm happy to help unless you have a bunch of personal, weird stuff you don't want me to see. No. Just don't open the one marked "Tools". Hi, sorry I'm late. Traffic was a biatch. Okay. Clearly Karen meant to fi this guy up with me. So here's how I see it. Barry and I have dinner. You cry quietly at a nearby table until I signal you to pay the check. I go home with him. You cook us brunch tomorrow. Eggs, please. Interesting. Here's how I see it. I grab you by the ear. I drag you to the door. And I push you in front of a car. Wait ! You don't understand. - Barry is my soul mate. - You haven't even met him. - I love him ! - You're crazy. Crazy in love ! Hey. You got the time ? I'm supposed to meet my date here at eight. Oh, it's ten after. You know women, they love to make an entrance. Apparently so does Will. Oh. Uh, I'm Will. Oh, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. You know, I don't go on a lot of dates, but at some point aren't we supposed to be at the same table ? Not always. - I'm Will. - Barry. Cousin Karen didn't do you justice. You're hot. She didn't do you justice either. You're you're here. - So, shall we order ? - Let's order. Kind of a late lunch so I and you're holding my hand. It's just, uh Dating it's, uh, a little new for me. Were you in a long term relationship ? Six years. It was pretty serious. - Oh. What was his name ? - Mary Elizabeth. Was that his drag name ? 'Cause I think I may have seen his show. No, it's a woman. I've never been out with a guy before. You're my first ! - Can I get anyone a drink ? - Oh, yeah. What do we homosexuals drink, Will ? Well, legally we can drink whatever we want. That was established in the Flaming Schnapps Act of 1983. Oh, man, this is going great. High five ! Hey, thanks for helping me unpack. Wedding pictures. Oh, no no no. You don't want to look at that. It's fifth in a series. You need to start with volume one. Grace, God. This dress is gorgeous. Everything's so nice. When we got married in my sister's backyard, there was dog poop everywhere and she wore shorts. My sister was so high at my wedding she thought it was my bat mitzvah. She kept shoving 20's down my dress. So we have a lot in common. Our sisters are bitches. Both our husbands are doctors. Well, mine's playing one in some Chekhov play in the Bowery. He makes $80 a week. And apparently he's not very good. Your husband's an actor. You're a massage therapist. That is so cool and bohemian. My husband's a doctor. How come we live in the same building ? The apartment belonged to my uncle. He died last year. - I'm sorry. - Keep it to yourself. We haven't told the super. - Your back ? - Yeah, I pulled it at the gym. Well, on the phone talking about going to the gym. Well, let me give you a massage. I'll grab my table. No. No, no, no. You've done too much for me already. Oh, please. I'm just so happy to talk to a neighbor about something other than the Holocaust. Damn, Grace, you're so tense. You're all knots and bones. It's like massaging a frozen turkey. Oh That feels so good. - Is the pressure okay ? - Perfect How about here ? - I'm just gonna go a little lower. - You go wherever you need to go. Well Thank you, Karen. I had my date with Barry last night. Tell me everything. skip the begging and the tears. That I can't stomach. Let's start with his stomach. It's soft like a baby's. And like a baby, he just came out ! Yeah, well, you're no prize pig yourself. You got a layer of pink flab, a pug nose, a squiggly little tail Hey, wait, maybe you are a prize pig ! Why are you in my life, you awful, awful woman ? The point is, you are desperate and he's family. So why don't you two join together in misery and make a rotten go of it ? Honey, you must like him. You sent him flowers and asked him to go out with you again tonight. I didn't send him any Oh, God ! Oh, honey, it made his day. And so did that picture of you sound asleep, making a human pyramid in your Joe Boxers. What ? Oh my God, I thought that was a dream. Rosario in camouflage, with a feather and a zoom lens. Great. Now I've gotta let him down easy. Hey, hey, save it for the locker room. Unbelievable ! I've got my own problems ! Karen, be honest. All right, I pinched Paul Lynde's wallet at the Desert Inn in '84. Well, that would explain why on your job application under references you wrote, "Not Paul Lynde". Look, help me with this. I just met my new neighbor, Julie. She's a massage therapist. She was helping me unpack and then she gave me a massage, which I think went a little too far south. Honey, you must've brought it on yourself. - What were you wearing ? - I was naked, under a sheet. Hmm, that's not it. Oh, my God. I got it. I got it. Karen, make an appointment with her. If she does the same thing to you then I know it's just part of the massage. - But if she doesn't do it to you - Then I'll do it to her. No. Then I will know that she was coming on to me. Ah. Honey, exactly where did she touch you ? Show me on this bottle of vodka. Right on the Smirnoff. - Oh, I don't believe this. - Please, just hear me out. I have waited my whole life to find love. And then, when it finally happens I am denied. And by who-em ? My best friend. Please, Will, let me love. - Hey, Barry. - I'll see you later. I'm sorry I'm late. I didn't know what to wear for our second homosexual date. Oh, traditionally, whatever's hanging on your homosexual chair in your homosexual bedroom. Here, I, uh, got you a present. It was 49.99. Oh, look at that. It's a rainbow flag beach towel. Do you already have one ? You probably already have one. No, I don't. And it'll come in handy, when I want people from space to know that I'm gay. I just thought I should get you something since you sent me those beautiful flowers. Look I gotta tell you something. I didn't I didn't send you those flowers. Karen, in her twisted way, thought she was trying to help. Oh. Heh. I thought it was a little weird when the card said, "Thanks for all the good gay sex, honey". Look, Barry, you're a great guy. - But I - It's okay. I'm sorry I'm not better at this. I was bad at being straight, now I'm bad at being gay. - It gets easier. - I guess. It's just I really like you. - You don't even know me. - I know you enough. You're nice. You're really smart. - You're handsome. - I know I'm sorry, Barry, I just I don't feel the same way about you. But I know someone out there will. You're gonna do great. Look, let's let's order. You know, it says "no sharing", but I say let's share. And dare them to oppose us. What do you say ? You know what, I think I'd rather go home. But thanks. I'll see you, Will. Keep the towel. So, what happened ? Did she knock, knock, knock on heaven's door ? What a waste ! I choppered that girl in from Brooklyn and all I got was a lousy massage ! I get more play outta Rosie when she's washing my bra with me still in it. Great. I guess I'm gonna have to have a talk with Julie. Same talk I had with the gift wrappers at Bloomingdale's. Shouldn't your finger be on that box ? I just saw Barry leave. What happened ? Look, I just bought this bag from the guy out front. Why are you buying a woman's purse ? 'Cause it goes with the shoes. Why so sad, big tiny ? I just had to let Barry down. The guy just came out and his first real date rejects him. What ? He's never been with a man before ? So he's the virgin Barry. - I feel bad for him. - Of course you feel bad. You are Barry. Barry is you. Ergo, you is Barry. Ergo, you is idiot. Perhaps. But I remember another boy who struggled on his way out of the closet. He had a little crush on me. I found him repellent. But still, I took him under my wing. I fixed his hair. - Taught him how to dress. - Yeah, you sent me to job interview wearing leg warmers with Chinese slippers. Perhaps. But the point is, we senior gays have a responsibility to the freshmen. To teach them, to bring them along. Why, I helped turn this caterpillar into a chubby butterfly. - And now you should do the same for Barry. - Why ? Why is this my responsibility ? Because that's what we do in the community. We gay it forward. How long you been sitting on that one ? Pretty much since the movie came out. Listen, I need to talk to you about something. Um, the massage last night This is gonna sound crazy. But did it mean more to you than it did to me ? Well, I didn't get paid, so I doubt it. No, no. What I mean is - Did you come onto me ? - What ? 'Cause you were really thorough. Dude. I'm a massage therapist, okay ? I go where the tension is. It really bums me out that you would think anything different. Oh, oh, gosh. I'm so sorry. Of course. I mean, I just I didn't realize I was tense there. - Maybe I should go. - No, don't go. I'm sorry. I'm from the city. We are not a trusting people. So I You know, I wasn't sure. I mean we were up all night drinking and laughing. And it ended with what I thought was inappropriate touching. Seemed like a lot of dates I've been on. Grace, when was the last time you had a girlfriend ? I mean, this is what we do. We talk. We kiss. We hug. We get to be intimate. It's what makes us better than men. Why do you think they die first ? I don't really have a lot of girlfriends. Well, I do, but they're men. Look, I gotta jet. But tomorrow night, you wanna catch a film ? - I'd love to. - Good, 'cause Greg's gonna be off somewhere doing stand-up. I mean, he doesn't make me laugh, but God bless. See you then. This is my friend, Jack. He'll be assisting me in this project. Now get dressed, we're going to the gym. It's after midnight. You're not ready to be seen during peak cruising hours. - What's this about ? - We're here to help. You got a late start, but we're gonna take care of you and raise you right. Think of us as your 'mo pair. - How long you been sitting on that one ? - Just since the cab. Here's your starter kit : All the Tales of the City books, Kiehl's non-alcohol face toner, Ethel Merman Gypsy, Angela Lansbury Gypsy, Tyne Daly Gypsy, and Pez. - Why Pez ? - Because it's fun. See, candy comes out of the neck. There's so much to learn. Well, you're in good hands. I just had a beautiful manicure. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			I love "24". But it's so unrealistic. I mean, it's 2 PM and he hasn't even peed yet. I've gone twice just watching it. Woof ! When did Kiefer Sutherland get so hot ? He didn't, sweetie What the hell did you two Mork and Mindy looking sons of bitches do to my cousin Barry ? You're supposed to help him be gay but you didn't finish. The poor kid's so confused, he's sittingat home on the couch watching football in a spandex onesie. We just got started. This is a guy who 24 hours ago thought that Batman and Robin just fought crime together. - We're makin' progress. - Yeah, well, step it up. The Human Rights Campaign gala is in a month. It's the social event of the gay season. Well, next to the Republican National Convention. - And I want Barry to be ready for it. - Karen, he's 20 pounds overweight, he shops at Miller's Outpost, and he has a beard. I don't mean "taking your mother to the Academy Awards" kind of beard. I mean actual facial hair. - He's right, Kare. - Can't be done. Homo wasn't built in a day. Well, that's too bad. 'Cause I was, uh, going through my jeans this morning, and I found 20 grand in that little pocket. And I was thinking that you guys could use that to bankroll this whole operation and, uh, keep whatever's left over for yourselves, but, oh, well. Would you just excuse us for a second ? We'll do it. And I'm sorry you had to see that. Grace ! Did you just get in ? How was your flight ? I live in Brooklyn. I took the subway. Right, right, right. So what was the in-flight movie ? Well, a smelly guy in Army fatigues did a dance for me. I love that guy. He taught me this move. Why do homeless guys always wear Army stuff ? Never the Navy, never a nice pea coat, or a sailor hat. Anyway, I just wanted to give you guys a heads-up. Leo and I are having a housewarming party. Now don't freak out about getting us a present. Don't go running from store to store. 'Cause everything I want is on this list. I'm not getting you another present. I haven't even got a thank-you note for the two wedding gifts I got you. Well, we need more stuff. What can I tell you ? Oh, honey, I'd love to go ! Oh, Brooklyn in the winter. Oh, you know what, I'm gonna use my miles ! Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 14 Fagmalion Part Two Attack Of The Clones sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Karen ? Did you sync up my Palm Pilot ? I sure did, honey. I also optimized your hard drive and traced that printer problem to a bad ethernet cable. Have I been drinking ? Come on, now, honestly, honey, I'm a little more together than you think. Hey, hey. Anyone order a cookie bouquet ? The talking cookies ! They're baaack ! Sure, they talk. But do they listen ? Honey. What are you doing here ? I thought you were elbow deep in someone's colon. Yeah. But then the office party ended. So Listen, I got some bad news. I don't think we can do that - housewarming thing this weekend. - No, I told you. When people complain about having to give another gift, you say that their first one never arrived. The thing is Do you remember the other day, I saw you in the kitchen in that mid-afternoon light. I said, "Man, you are the most beautiful woman in the world. How did I get so lucky ?" Yeah, I'm going to Africa for a month. I leave on Friday. What ? No, you're What ? Doctors Without Borders called. That clinic I helped set up last summer, they're way understaffed. There's a virus and a vaccine. And I have to be there. Plus they think I'm on "ER". I can't believe they're having a viral outbreak the same weekend as our housewarming party. Why do these things always happen to me ? - I'm sorry, baby. - I know. - I'm just gonna miss you. - I know. I'm gonna miss you too. We can talk more about it later. I gotta go pick up some toys. I fathered, like, ten kids in that village. If I show up empty-handed, there will be hell to pay. Honey are the cookies gone ? Okay, so we're clear on this, right ? You're gonna be in charge of Barry's body. I'm gonna work on his mind. Things like gay culture, gay politics, driving up the cost of real estate in affordable areas. Okay. But if you have his mind and I have the body, who gets the hair ? 'Cause it grows out of the mind, but it's still kinda part of the body. That's a very good question. And that makes me feel even better about being in charge of the mind. We'll save the hair for last. This is a huge project. It's such an awesome responsibility to think of someone other than myself. I'm a good person. I'm a great person. Oh, come on, Barry. This is an easy one. - Um, I'm not sure. - Take a guess. - Salma Hayek ? - Salma Hayek ? Is that not a real person ? I don't even know how I know that name. It's Vivian Leigh from Gone With the Wind ! How can a person not know that ? I'm tired and thirsty. Can I have a Coke ? It's Diet Coke. And no ! Come on ! Let's go, let's go ! Push ! Remember : No pecs, no sex ! This all seems so superficial. Are gay guys only about bodies and faces ? Absolutely not. They're only about bodies. Faces you can cover up with a cute hat or leather hood. Looser, looser. Tighter, tighter. Pull it in ! Look, um this move unless you're one of the Brady kids, should be stricken from your dance vocabulary. Okay, Barry. Now, come on. Sit here, sweetheart. Watch and learn, all right ? And note, these moves can also be performed on roller skates, okay ? Man, making someone gay is exhausting. I don't know how my mother did it. Oh, no. Is it 5:00 already ? Yeah, the cab's out front. Boy, 28 hours on a plane. What do you bet I still won't get through the corrections ? You know, I am so proud of you. Tonight I'm gonna close my eyes and imagine I'm in Africa with you, helping the needy. Till "The Osbournes" start. Then you're on your own. Okay, I gotta go save some lives. Yeah, I gotta go save 50%. Barney's is having a sale. Bye. I love you. I don't blame you. Bye. Yes ? Um, if you see some cute bowls for cheap, totally stock up. And don't agree on the first price, 'cause they expect you to haggle. Grace, these people don't have water. I didn't say they were good at haggling. What ? I'll get a bowl, okay ? I'll take their food and dump it on the ground and take the bowl. No, I just don't want you to forget to pay the gas bill. It's due on the 21st. Yeah, I'll pay them in wildebeests. - Grace, I'm gonna be sub-Saharan Africa. - Hey, I work too. I didn't say you didn't. I just assumed, while I was gone, you'd take care of the household stuff. Oh. 'Cause I'm a housewife now ? Suddenly, I'm the woman ? Should I crank out a couple of kids while you're gone too ? Grace, I really don't have time for this. I have to get to the airport and exchange my 100 American dollars for ten billion Zairian dollars. Fine, then I'm coming with you. 'Cause we haven't even begun to discuss who's gonna wash the dishes that are still in the sink. - He's pretty cute, isn't he ? - Yeah. - Go talk to him. - What ? I can't do that. He's out of my league. He's an all-star. I'm barely in the minors. Sports again ? What did I tell you to do when those thoughts come into your head ? Right. Judy, Liza, Barbra, Bette, these are names I shan't forget. Good. Or Dream Girls, Company, Chorus Line, these three shows are quite divine. Come on, you can do this. That's easy for you to say. You're a god. Please. A "god". In what way am I like a god ? You're hot. You're successful. Every guy in this bar is checking you out. No, they're not. Look, I was once where you are. Sorry, you're blocking their view of me. Everyone has a first time, Barry. - I can't believe you were ever like me. - Well, I was. In my first time in a gay bar, I was no more comfortable than you are. I've just been out a couple of weeks, and Jack just decided to throw me into the deep end - What do you think you're doing ? - I'm eating peanuts. Have you lost your mind ? Those are little pellets of fat and breath. You might as well be chewing on loneliness. Have you asked anyone to dance ? Have you talked to anybody ? Have you done anything ? I can't. I feel like everyone's judging me. Well, of course they are. It's a gay bar. Now, come on. Get out there. Who do you like ? What about that guy ? I saw you doing one of these when we walked in. What ? That guy ? No, he'd never go out with me. How do you know until you try ? Come on, do it, Will. - Come on, you got nothing to lose. - I'm scared. We're all scared. You gotta develop thick skin. And then moisturize and sleep in gloves. Come on, go. - Jack, stop it. - Go, go. - Hi, I'm Will. - Zack. - I'm Will. - Still Zack. Sorry. Talk to him. Talk to him. Talk. Look, I've never done this before, but Sure, I'll go out with you. Just like that, I got my first date. He ended up stealing my identity and traveling around Europe on my credit cards, but that "yes" felt good. - There's your guy. Come on, make your move. - Really ? No, I don't know. I Come on, come on. Do it. Get your "yes". And don't give out your PIN number, even if he says he needs it to "do your chart". - Hi, I haven't done this much, but - No. Okay, how 'bout this ? I'll pay the bills, but when you come home, you are going to wash the oatmeal pot. You know what, honey, why don't you send me the pot ? It'll be a nice break from bringing people back from the brink of death. Brink of death ? Give me a break. You're staying at a Hyatt. This is ridiculous. We're here. Oh, oh, oh, look at that. You took the luggage we just got as a wedding present. I guess it's just for you. Okay, I think I know what's going on here. Oh, really ? Enlighten me, Mr. Take-My-Luggage. It's Doctor Take-My-Luggage. Come on, Grace. You're pickin' a fight with me 'cause you don't want to say good-bye. You're having trouble dealing with the fact that we just got married, and now I'm going away for awhile. And maybe if you're mad at me, then you won't have to deal with your real feelings about me leaving. Is any of this true ? And don't answer me with any of the sounds your dad makes after dinner. Hey ! His chair makes weird sounds. When you ask him to do it again, he can't ! I have to go. - Do you really want to leave it like this ? - You're the one leaving ! Okay. Fine. I'll see you in a month. Good-bye. - Barry, wait. - Forget it, Will. Look, I appreciate everything you've done, but I want to go home. No, you can't leave. You're doing great. Great ? The guy said no before I even finished my sentence. He put his hand in my face. That's gay for "Stop in the name of love". And then come here. - I'm not an idiot. - I know. It'd be a lot easier if you were. Idiots do really well in these places. just got three numbers. And I just stole the wallet of "Who's The Boss"'s Danny Pintauro. I'll see you guys later. If I leave now, I can cry in the tub and still have time to eat everything in the fridge. Barry, don't go. Don't you want to have your first man-on-man kiss tonight and give me something to call your religious maniac parents about ? I can't do this. Just because Will got a guy on his first night in a gay bar, doesn't mean I can. Oh, please, is that what he told you ? Well, I did score my first time out. Ish Come on, just go out with my friend. There's 20 bucks in it for you. Which one is he ? Okay, 40. And you can lose the 'tude. You act like you know Wham! or something. You paid him to go out with me ? - We talked about this. - We have not ! Oh. Well, I talk to other people about it. Even I got a few miles out of that one at the family picnic. - Wait, that was you ? - Cousin Gina laughed so hard, coleslaw came out of the hole in her neck. Oh, boy. I gotta call that Gina. She's such a Oh, crap. There's Danny Pintauro, and he looks pissed. - You are unbelievable. - What's the big deal ? It's not like you just found out you're adopted or Canadian. The big deal is that all of my confidence as a gay man is based on that moment. - And now it's a lie. - I was just trying to help you - the way we're helping Barry. - Do not compare me to Barry ! Why not ? Look at him. That wreck is you Oh, please ! I was never as bad as he is ! Barry's pathetic ! - Stop it. - Barry. This does not concern you, okay ? We are discussing Barry right now. Stop talking about me like I'm not even here. You call me pathetic, but I look at you guys, and all you care about are superficial things, like the homoerotic subtext of "The A-Team". Or how to make your butt stand out, even in a dense fog. I didn't come out so I could be in your twisted production of My Fairy Lady. I came out so I could find a guy and fall in love. So what do you two have to teach me ? You got a 15-year head start, and you're both alone. Now who's pathetic ? Whew, I gave Pintauro the slip. Now who wants a drink ? I got "Who's The Boss" money ! Ugh, he calls me selfish. When you think about it, isn't helping people even more selfish ? And then he tries to make it seem like I'm unreasonable. - I'not the one being unreasonable. - Grace. Yes, I am. Turn around. I can't leave it like this. And I'm telling you now, if I forget to tip, it's just 'cause I'm upset. Now here's the thing. If something's bothering me, I just say it. I don't try to hide it. I don't make somebody guess what it is. I don't bury it in conversation about pots or luggage. Why should I indulge her craziness ? Because you love her. Crap ! That's what the Skycap said Will, do you think I'm pathetic ? No, of course not. You think I'm pathetic ? Sometimes. That's not how that's supposed to go. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Gimme again, gimme again. Do you think I'm pathetic ? Sometimes. He really nailed us. Shallow, vain. Are we those guys ? No. Of course not. Speaking of "veins", I got a new one coming in on my forearm. I think I'm gonna name him Kevin. He's absolutely right. I am alone. - What makes me such an expert ? - No, Jocelyn. Hi, Jocelyn. Look, um, I'm sorry. I think I was a little hard on you before. Don't apologize, Barry. Will needed to hear it. Anyway, if you're still into it, I'd like to start training again. 'Cause even if you are kinda superficial, I'd rather go through this with someone than go through it alone. - We'd be honored. - Plus, if you can manage it, I'd really like to look like this guy. Check out those abs. Aren't they fabulous ? - Was that ? - I think it was. Baby's first "fabulous". Get the camcorder. Are those - Is that Gucci on your feet ? - Oh, yeah. Aren't they great ? They kill my toes and cost a fortune, but what the hell ? I'll take out another credit card. I think I'm gonna cry. Will, do you know what this means ? - Unrealistic body expectations. - Choosing fashion over comfort. Living beyond your means. Boy George, I think he's got it ! Ma'am, I need you to take your seat. We're getting ready for takeoff. Yeah, I need to find my husband. We're flying together. Now ! You know, you're not supposed to use that while we're taxiing. Yeah, well, you're not supposed to take two blankets either, so let's just mind our own beeswax. - Hello ? - Hi, Leo. You'll never believe what I did. Um, what seat are you in ? I'm not sitting. I just got home. - Home ? - I just thought we needed a real good-bye, so I switched my flight to tomorrow. Where are you ? Karen. Karen. Leave me alone. Karen Please, what do you cookies want from me ? We're not the cookies. We're the pencil sharpener ! Oh, thank God ! For a second there, I thought the cookies were talking to me.

                    			Okay, I have a big problem with this love letter you wrote to your husband in Africa ? Where did you get this ? I gave this to Karen to mail yesterday. Yeah, and she gave it to me to read, laugh at, and make copies of. That's how we've been doing it for years. That is a gross invasion of privacy ! Besides, I thought that's what we did to Will ! Come on, you gotta throw us a little something spicy in there. Where do you keep recent photos of yourself squatting naked on a sheepskin rug ? Right next to the picture of me doing this. All right, come over to my apartment tonight. We'll start all over. Bring some tracing paper, and don't wear any underwear. Tempting but Will and I are getting together. Finally. It's been, like, forever. I mean, between me living in Brooklyn and him working all the time And now you're thinking about tracing your own thing. - Ah, hey, Karen. What are ya doin' ? - Oh, just a sec. Stanley walker is a dirty pig, and I hope he rots in hellll ! I'm good. How are you guys ? - Problem with Stan ? - I can't believe him. Parading around town with that new British slut of his ! Last week they had dinner at the mayor's mansion. Apparently, she spent the entire night sitting on his lap, feeding him steaks. 'Ere's a nice T-bone for ya, love. Hope you saved room for a bucket of "po-tah-toes". Oh, I regret the day I ever laid boobs on that man ! - God, that's just awful. - Yeah. Okay, your turn. Kare, during all my struggles, you've constantly been partially there for me. Is there anything I can pretend to do for you now ? Well, there is, Jackie. You know, there's, uh, one last box of my personal effects at the mans. It's mostly sentimental stuff Old photos, birthday cards. The receipt I got when Rosario's parents sold her to me. That kinda thing. What are you saying ? I mean, would I like to spend a few unsupervised hours rummaging through your closet ? Does a gay bear have anonymous sex in the woods ? Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 15 Homojo sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ God, that doorman's a real jerk. I lived here five years. I move out, suddenly, Tony looks at me like he's never seen me before ? Tony retired at Christmas, Grace. That's the new doorman, Abe, who's black, while Tony was white. I don't see people that way. So you ready to rock the house ? You ready to kick out the jams ? - Let's do it to it. I brought the cheese. - She brought the cheese ! Oh, you actually brought cheese. Yeah. Cheese night. Like we used to do. Brought a little camembert, a little stilton, a little gouda and some Kraft singles, 'cause I love that clammy feeling when you hold them up against your face. I've been off dairy for two months. Didn't I tell you ? - Did you ? - I thought I did. - So, no cheese ? - Sorry. But hey, hey, hey ! We can still do movie night ! I got The Rookie. I know Baseball, yuck. But Dennis Quaid, yum ! And Dennis Quaid in a cup yummer. Um, I already saw that with Leo. But we were gonna see it together. - Six months ago. - You know what ? It's fine. That just means that we have the whole night to sit here and talk. Yes, we have tons to catch up on. What are you doing in this closet ? You look like the kind of man that should be coming out of one. I have business here. Who are you ? I might ask the same question of you. Why, I'm Jack, Karen's friend. She didn't wanna come 'cause she didn't wanna run into that British slut. With your thick Hungarian accent, you obviously work here. Have you have you met her ? What's she like ? Well, she's got curly hair, like me, long legs, like me. She shags like a banshee, like me. And her favorite dance move is this. So you're that tart from the prison who stole Karen's husband right out from on top of her ! I'm the new woman in Stan's life. Lorraine Finster. Get a load of me. Stay away from me ! Don't look at me ! Or my package ! How can I not ? It's looking at me. You like it now, you should see it at night, when it's all lit up. No ! No ! Karen Walker's my friend ! I don't want anything to do with you ! Good day, Miss. I said, good day ! Are you a dancer ? Why would you say that ? Well, it struck me that you have the bearing of a dancer. Now, perhaps I'm wrong, but I was a ballerina back in the U.K.. So I tend to have a bit of an eye for these things. Well Heh heh In some circles, I'm known as a dancer. Actually, they're not so much circles, as cages. Well actually I wasn't so much a ballerina, as a stripper. - Bon-bon ? - Uh, love one. Wow. We were both at the bottom, and we pulled ourselves up with true grit and other people's money. I admire us. - I'm a little in love with you. - Really ? 'Cause I feel like I could fall too. But I can't ! You're the enemy ! - Or am I your new best friend ? - Damn, I think you are ! Honey, uh I'm a little concerned that you and Will aren't connecting anymore. - Why do you say that ? - Oh, well, you mention it in this letter you wrote to your husband in Africa. God, you people ! That's awful ! Unless we're doing it to Will ! Things are weird with us. We're off. It's like we've lost our mojo. Or, in our case, our "homojo". Well, honey, you know what you have to do, huh ? Seduce him. Yeah, go to La Perla, buy some sexy thongs and bra undershirts Put on some Paul Anka, bend him over the couch, and have at him ! You know Will and I don't have sex. Well, then, honey, what's your version of sex, huh ? What gets you two excited ? - The most excited ? - Uh-huh. Yeah. That would have to be, without question game night. Ooohh ! Game night ! Ooh, sounds tedious. - You should do that. - You know what ? You're right. We should ! It is so It's so fun ! Every year, Joe and Larry and Rob and Ellen come over, and we have this this big, huge parlor game blowout. We play for the "Suck On It" cup. God, that's tragic ! What's that ? It's a trophy. And we call it the "suck on it" cup because when you win And Will and I always win You get to turn to the losers and say, "Suck on it !". Which lever do I pull to be crushed by a safe ? Well, honey, what are you waiting for ? I mean, come on, call that Mo and Mary and Blob and Yellen and get 'em over to your place ! God, this is just perfect. This is this is just what Will and I need. Thank you, Karen. You know, sometimes, even a wet brain makes sense. - Anyway, here's your stuff. - Oh, Jackie, thank you. At last, I'm out of Stan's shadow. Well, if I leave the Tristate area. No prob, it was cinchy. So, I'll see ya later. - Jack ? - I'm sorry ! I met Stan's new girlfriend, Lorraine. We spent the whole day together. It was magical. Like a movie. Like something Miramax would shove down the Academy's throat during Oscar time. There, I said it. Uh, I was just gonna ask you why my teddy is missing. Oh, I'm gonna add a flounce to make him more masculine. Anyway, Kare you'd really like her. The three of us should go away for the weekend together. Amish country, maybe. Huh, fun. I do like a nice apple butter. So it's it's okay ? Oh, cutie, of course it is ! Come here, you ! You backstabbing boy bitch ! You are never, never seeing her again ! Do you hear me ? You stay away from that London hog, or I'll put fishhooks in your nipples and fly you off the Chrysler Building ! You got that ? Why do you make me do this to you ? But Lorraine's just so much fun. And I love my accent when I'm with her. It's so bleedin' 'ard to stay 'way. So what ? You just met this woman, and Karen's been with you for thousands of dollars. The damn Brit gets me, Will. She sees what's underneath. Right down to the surface. So tell me, what is this "gay night" you're having ? And why isn't this invited ? It's "game night". It's nothing like "gay night". It's a whole evening of interesting games, and someone goes home with a "Suck On It" cup. Actually, it's quite a bit like "gay night". You know, it's good you and Grace are doing this. You guys have been really off lately. - So you've noticed ? - I may have read it in a letter somewhere. Well this is our chance to get it back. Whenever Grace and I were having problems in the past, game night was always the fix. Something about lording it over our suburban friends with our mastery of showbiz trivia that really gets to the core of what makes our relationship special. You know, game night even solved the big fight of '91 ? Don't you wanna know what that fight was about ? You know, I trust that it solved it, so Ready ? And go ! A duck. A chicken. An emu. Uma Thurman. Shamu. Okay, no. Okay. The sun. The moon. Reverend Sun Myung Moon. An eclipse. Eclair. Claire Danes. A great dane. Dame Judy Dench. - Dame Maggie Smith - Enough with the dames ! - No talking ! - Ten seconds. Okay Oh, a flower ! A gun ! A garden ! Madison Square Garden ! - Time ! - Garden of Eden. What ? That's not in Midtown ! I didn't draw "Midtown". Well, well. You just move right in, don't ya ? I guess the guy I paid to hussy-proof this place missed a few spots. Well, you must be the old Mrs. Walker. And you were married to Stan as well, weren't you ? - What's that smell ? - Stan's favorite perfume. Dab of roast beef behind each knocker. Lamb chops work too. But I'm not here to discuss beauty tips. Where's my Jackie ? I know you've got him. And you know how I know ? Because I really think so. Well, you're mistaken. Now, I believe you know where the door is. It's the tall, square thing you go through on your way to the plastic surgeon. Why, you slimy limey ! I've got half a mind to No. No, I'm going to take the high road. And not just because I'm high. I'll be leaving now. Just going to take one little thing with me. Come on, Jackie. You listen to me, little missy. You may have taken my steer, but I'll be damned if you're gonna take my queer ! Come on ! Jackie, where are you going ? - But I - Come here. Jack, no. Come here. Come to me. Come on. Jackie, come. Come on. Oh, that's a good Jackie. - Come here, Jackie. - That's a good boy, - Jackie, come here. - Jackie, come. Jackie ! Oh, looky here ! All right, stop it ! You're gonna make me piddle ! If you're gonna make me choose, then I choose Karen. I'm sorry, Lorraine. I like you, but I love Karen. We have a special bond. And let's face it. It would take four of your boobs to fill one of her cups. Oh, poodle, do you mean it ? Of course. Your boobs are huge ! Mine will be too, a week from Monday. Come on, Jackie, let's go home, pass out, and forget this ever happened. And I swear I'll never cheat on you again. Hey, if Karen dies, I'll totally call you. Okay, going into the final round, Larry and I are in first, Rob and Ellen, you're second, Will and Grace, you guys are in third. Or, as we like to call it, last with a big "L" for "loser" ! Hey Hey ! We can still win this, you know. Yeah, we still have 30 seconds. We can take it. That is pressure. Hope you don't crack ! - See how I got in her head ? - You've already been in her pants. Okay, you ready ? Yeah, I'm ready. Why would you think I wasn't ready ? Because earlier, when we were playing charades, and I went like this, you said "parmesan". You don't realize how important cheese is until it's gone. All right, you ready ? Go. Okay, uh, uh, uh, she she's an actress, her last name is a senator, ran for President. Gore. Lesley Gore. Gore Vidal. Vidal Sassoon. - Paul Mitchell. - No. - Lost to Nixon. - Okay, Mondale, - Dukakis, Humphrey. Holly Humphrey ! - Okay, time out ! - Ah ! You can't call time out ! - Au contraire, my pregnant friend ! The timeout was established after the great bathroom controversy of 1997 ! Each team may call one, and only one, time out, per tournament, as long as a new clue is selected upon their return. Read your rule book ! Come on, Grace ! Guys, he's right. And we're sitting in the wrong order. Here, you need to be over here What happened to you ? Do you know what it means if they beat us in there tonight ? It means they're gonna look at us with the same mix of pity and disgust that we do them, and I'm not about to let that happen ! I mean I mean - Will We've lost it. - What ? Whatever it is we had that connection. That thing that made us us. It's just it's not there anymore. Sure it is. It it it it's - It's really not, is it ? - No. And I don't know if it's because I got married, or because we're not living together anymore or what, but it's gone. It's like we lost our mojo. Or, in our case, our "homojo". Get. Out. - That is exactly what I said. - What ? When ? - The other day. To Karen. - Whoa, slow down. You did ? Why didn't you call me ? I don't know, it was a gay pun. - It just seemed a little small. - But that's exactly what we're missing. We need to check in, and not just about the big important stuff, but the little, trivial things that people really care about. It was just so much easier when we were living together. You know, I get an overzealous bikini wax, that's three hours of conversation. Now, we gotta make an effort. You gotta call me - if you go off cheese. - I know You're right. That that was stupid. You know, I think I might have called and then hung up. Still think we're gonna be okay ? - I think we are. - Promise ? Oh, look who's back. It's the losers. Losers ! Suck on it ! How's that taste ? Suck on it ! - We still have a little time left. - Oh, yeah, three seconds. And no one can do that. Not even the great Will and Grace. Just give him the clue, Blob. Ready ? Go ! - Bangs. - Nancy McKeon. - When did he ask you to mail this ? - Yesterday. Read it, read it, read it. "And though I've never written one of these fan letters before, Justin" "I just want to wish you all the luck in the world on your solo career." "Sincerely yours, Will Truman !" - What are you guys reading ? - Nothing. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			Karen, what's wrong ? You've hardly touched your muffin. Oh, honey, c'mon. Since Stan and I split I've done nothing but touch my muffin. Ugh, now I don't even want it. I don't know what it is. Everywhere I go, I see Stan. In the thick ankles of a bakery clerk. In the sagging breasts of a bus driver. Even in the eyes of a fat baby. Wow, Karen He was a really fat man, wasn't he ? He sure was, Jackie. Well, Karen, maybe our little girls' night tomorrow will help you take your mind off it. - You're gonna have a girls' - No. Wait, are you sure that's tomorrow night ? Lemme check my book.

Well, that's good 'cause I left the plastic bag at home. Your job ! You have a job. It's time to go to work. Again ? I just worked, like last Tuesday. Jack, you charge your acting students money. You have an obligation to show up and make them regret that. I get this one. - You realize that's my wallet. - Yeah, I got it. Okay, people, who left their dog tied up with no food, no water and a Willie Nelson bandana ? Well, like, whoever you are you don't deserve a dog. That's why I let him go.

It's me Jack McFarland. - No way. - Way ! - For real ? - Real ! - Get out of town ! - Town ! Well, I think I can leave you two to your Mensa meeting.

But now I have my braces off. Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 16 Women and Children First sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Anyway after highschool I realized I had babysat for everyone in the neighborhood. And it was like, you know "Enough ! I need a change. " So, I got a Eurail pass and I babysat my way through Europe. Wow, Sissy, you've lived a glamorous life. Knock on wood. Mm, these are delicious. What are they ? They are Mint Milanos. Still with the expensive taste, I see. So, do you have a boyfriend ? What about that guy from the couch ? Do you still see him ? You mean Randall ? Yeah, we had an on again off again thing for years. You know, it was on and then it was off and then he got married and it was on again. - More tea ? - Please. God, look at you You are so grown up. Did you ever dream that one day you would be sitting in your own apartment, drinking tea ? You know what, Sissy ? I did. But not with you and not with tea and definitely not in my own apartment. Oh, you know what ? I better scooteroo. I'm between jobs and I really should use my downtime. I'm way behind on my friendship bracelets. Wait, Sissy. Do you have to go ? Well, I thought you said that you were teaching a class tonight. Yeah, but I don't wanna. Work's no fun. I wanna stay here and lay with you, like we used to. Wait a minute. What if this was your next job ? What if you were my babysitter again ? - I don't know, Jack. - I could pay you ! Okay. I am so excited you guys are finally meeting. I'll get drinks. - So, Julie, are you married ? - Yeah. He's an actor. Huh, well, "actor. " He did four student films last year and played Aladdin at the mall. What's yours do ? Cleans his ears with his car keys. And he's an accountant. Yeah, I led with the interesting one. Okay, bitches, let's get this lady love-in started. Who's up first ? And, yum. A hottie grows in Brooklyn. Karen, it's not that kind of girls' night. She's harmless, really. But just for fun, lock the door when you got to the bathroom. Oh, relax, Grace. I know how to do this. I've been in a sweat lodge with Candi Bergen and Penny Marshall. Well, not a sweat lodge so much as Penny's Aerostar. So what are we drinkin' about ? Oh, the usual. Rob's boring, and it's his fault I'm fat. At least he works. The only thing my husband did last year is add "Southern accent" to his resume. Oh, you wanna play this game ? My half-ton husband spent met some hussy in the cafeteria. Now they're shacked up at my mansion sharing the bed we used to make rabid love in. If you're playing "whose husband is worse" with Karen don't play for money. She's still collecting from Linda Hussein. C'mon, Grace. Tell us. What bugs you about Leo ? - Nothing, he's perfect. - C'mon give us somethin' ! Likes to wear your lipstick to bed, cries in the shower, likes to kiss I'm sorry. It's great. Married four months and still no problems. - Unless you consider constant lovin' a problem. - Oh, this is gross. Get her ! Whoo ! That's Leo. This is the time he calls to say he loves me. My husband calls the same time every day too. Maybe one of these days I'll pick up. I'm sorry I'm late. Did I miss girls' night ? Honey, you missed "girls' night" by about a hundred years. Shut your hole you drunken doughnut. Oh, my mood stabilizer party mix. Uppers, downers and candy corn. And don't tell my doctor, he's trying to get me off sugar. - Everything okay, Grace ? - Um, no. That was Leo. Uh, he's not coming back for another five weeks. Why ? What happened ? Um, I don't know. Uh, one of the doctors there ate some bad pork. or was eaten by a wild pig Um, all I know is that he He volunteered to stay longer. Here, honey have some party mix. You'll feel better. Or worse. That's what I love about party mix, you never know. C'mon, Jack ! The movie starts in half an hour. I don't wanna miss the previews. Then I'll never know what books have been made into movies that are now available on video. We're gonna need to use our indoor voice. I just put Jack down for his nap and I don't need you out here yelling like the wild man from Borneo. We're, like, 40. So, do you think you could stop talking to me like I'm a cub scout ? We're going to the movies. - Oh ? What movie ? - The new Vin Diesel thing. I don't think so. I hear it's violent, with a strong homoerotic subtext. - Why do you think we're going ? - Sissy ? My blanky fell off the bed ! I gotta go. Bye. So, it's another month. I mean, if anything it's good news. 'Cause now, I have another few weeks to do these dishes in the sink. I think there's peanut butter in the bottom of this glass. - So what'd you tell him, Grace ? - I told him it was fine. What else was I gonna say ? He's a million miles away. - You did the right thing. - I did, right ? You know, since we had our second baby I've been wanting to take a fork and just stab Rob in the balls with it. But I'm not about to bother Rob with that at the office. Julie, do you think I did the right thing ? Yeah. You never tell guys what you're feeling. Let them figure it out on their own that you hate them. Thanks. Rosario ? Yeah, dress slutty shut up. That's my motto. Great. Okay. Thank you. Guess that settles that. So, girls' night. Anyone with a uterus drinks free ! Hold on there, red. Don't you wanna hear what I have to say about this ? Well, Karen Come on. What ? Well, you're you. And ? And Come on. I see. No, no, no. That's all right. Honey, I understand. You think that just because my marriage failed that I have nothing to offer. You have things to offer. You would be the first person I'd call, if I wanted to hurt an orphan's feelings. Well, I know more about marriage than any of these girls ever will. And if you wanted my opinion, I would tell you to grow a set pick up the phone and call that no-good do-good husband of yours and tell him how you feel. That you're sitting here, home alone, pissed off while he's out there giving free boob jobs to hyenas ! But you don't care what I think so I'm outta here ! And I'm taking this with me. I'm certainly not leaving $3,000 worth of snacks where I'm not appreciated. Yes, the files just arrived. But, Mr. Stein, there is no way I can get all this done by Monday. I do too have a life. I In fact, I've got plans with my friend Jack tonight. But he's napping at the moment, so Hello ? I thought we were going to the movies. I was looking forward to going to see Vin Diesel. I heard he's got a new facial expression. I came to get you. But that crazy lady with the rockin' body sent me away. Jack, what are you doing with her ? She is in my employ. I am a very busy man and I need a staff. What exactly is her position ? She's my, uh She helps me with my, um You know, she sometimes she sometimes - She's your babysitter, isn't she ? - Yes ! She's my babysitter. So what if she is ? There's nothing wrong with that. What does she do ? Feed you, change you, pat you on the back to burp you ? Only when Mr. Gas Bubble's shy. Oh, my god, I was joking ! This is the creepiest thing I've ever heard. - Well, that's what babysitters do. - For babies ! What are you implying, Will ? That there's something odd about my relationship with Sissy ? You're an adult, Jack. Well, I don't wanna be an adult anymore ! It's very hard ! Sissy Sissy takes care of me. She makes me feel good. She cuts the crusts off my sammiches. Jack, you're a grown man. A grown man does not need a babysitter. How dare you call me a grown man ! I'm sorry, was my attempt to draft a 1 billion-dollar corporate merger keeping "wittle Jackie" awake ? You know, you shouldn't make that face. It might freeze that way. Look, William. I don't want to be the cause of any tension between you and Jack. Do you think maybe I could come in and we could talk about it ? I'm incredibly busy I don't see how that's possible. - I make killer s'mores. - I'll preheat the oven. No, Leo, I'm not asking you to come home. I just want you to understand that I'm upset. That these, these decisions affect me too and I want us to make them together. All right ? I love me too. Grace Hey, you came back. Well I got all the way home and realized I forgot my maid. I usually keep an extra under the mat, but You were right. - It was better to tell him. - Well, I'm glad. So how'd it go ? Well, I could tell Leo felt bad. That felt good. You should let me help you more, honey. I know a few things and I care about you. Now let's get back in there. C'mon, we got a room full of lovely ladies. Let's put on some music and get those tops off. You do know that it's not that kind of girls' night ? We'll see. - God, I love s'mores. - Why don't you marry 'em ? Don't make me laugh. No time to laugh. Look at all this law stuff. No way I'm ever gonna get finished. Well, you know, that's one way of looking at it. But there is another way. Inch by inch Foot by foot It won't take long with the homework song You do one task That's all we ask You do one more and you get another s'more  Well, when you say it like that it does seem totally doable. - Now, c'mon. You try. - Oh, I don't know. Come on. Case by case Tort by tort Sign and stamp Hey, I finished one report Foot by foot Mile by mile Perhaps I should try the McKendrick file So grown men don't need babysitters, huh ? She's not my babysitter. She's just singing me a little song to help me with my casework. We learned that in law school. Oh, would you just admit it ? It feels good to be taken care of. - Nice work, Sissy. - Hey, it was your plan smarty-pants. Wait You two set me up ? And it was easy. You're a whore for a s'more. Hey, there is no comparison between what happened here and the sick relationship you two have. And blow Thank you. The difference is I don't need it. What are you saying ? - I believe you heard me. - What's your point ? - I think you got it. - What are you implying ? What I said outright. You're a Sissy-holic. So what if, what if I am hooked on my babysitter ? It's a hard-candy world out there and sometimes this fella needs a little break. So if I have to pay someone $4 or $5 an hour to help me get through it then it's worth it. - Actually, Jack, I make $40 an hour. - Good-bye, Sissy. - I don't need you anymore. - What are you saying ? Sis I think he's right. I think I maybe need to outgrow you. Damn it. Why does everyone outgrow me ? I mean I know being a babysitter is all flashy and ooh-la-la. But you don't know the heartbreak behind it. The kids grow up and I never see 'em again. You know, but then I ran into you. And I thought maybe there are some things that don't change. Well, Sissy, we can still hang out and be friends and spend time together. - I mean, you don't have to charge me. - Yeah, I do. I need the money. I'm into Casual Corner for, like, 12 grand. I understand. It's been fun and I guess it had to end sometime. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			So anyway, when Leo got the call from Doctors Without Borders, he didn't wanna go, but I insisted. And if that makes me a hero, so be it. You're the hero in a lotta your stories. Thank you. So, now he's in Africa Oh, you're gonna love this. He was responsible And it made him insane with malaria. But if I could just get serious for a moment. I really feel like things Five, four, three, two Oh, Will, there you are. I'm sorry I'm late. The cast of Urinetown is after me. Simple misunderstanding. How's my hair ? I told them I wanted it to look "second-day-dirty". Delicious, your ears have never looked better. - Why my ears ? - Learn to take a compliment. Here's the bill for "Red McChatty" back there. Get the next one shampooed, I'm gonna go out back and smoke whatever's in the bottom of my pocket. Actually, your next one, Barry, isn't here yet. But we'll be making his decisions for him. Yeah, he's 35. He just came out of the closet. We've been working with him for the last few weeks to get him ready for the HRC Gala tonight. I hear what you're saying : "Tonight, are you mad ? He should've had his hair cut a week ago, it would have time to set, that's Hair 101." Yeah, but we had a dilemma. You see, his body was in worse shape than his hair, so we had to send him to a fat farm. He thought he was going to a spa. Isn't that great ? Why is everyone talking to me today ? Um Anyway, this is how we want his hair cut, okay ? - Chunky, but not too chunky. - PC, but not too PC. And gay, but not too gay. Yeah, we want him to be cruised in Chelsea, but not beat up in Brooklyn. Oh, crap, here she comes ! Hey. So, how's my hair look ? Delicious. Your ears have never looked better. Thank you. And you two look great. And I'm not saying that just because I feel so good about myself right now. Well, you know, it's a big night. Every a-list gay will be there. You know, the creme de la creme of the creme de la femme. And I am not leaving that benefit until I get serious with at least five guys. Hey Hey, the Human Rights Campaign is not some silly dating service. It's an essential advocacy group for gay and lesbian issues. How did that sound ? Too smart to land a hot dumb guy ? Careful with those tips, I want them nice and pointy in case I have to stab someone in the neck. My, my, my, my, my. If it isn't my dear friend, Karen Walker. So nice to see you. Why, Beverley Leslie, if you'd sit on a phone book, it'd be nice to see you too. Oh, honey, I haven't had a chance to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your poor wife, Crystal. Is she any better ? Well, it was a dicey, experimental surgery. But those Dominican doctors said if she wanted to look 70 again, she'd just have to try it. And yet, she lived through it. You must have been devastated. Oh, I'll survive. But poor you Your husband, Stanley Walker, dumps you for a younger hootchie mama who serves soft potatoes. He went from smashed to mashed. I have to laugh to keep from crying. Will, Jack, this whole day has been a disaster. D.I. Saster. The plane from the S & M camp you call a spa took off a half-hour late. So what do I do ? I eat a muffin. Sure, I spit most of it into a trash can like they taught me, but, I accidentally swallowed a few crumbs, and god help me maybe a nut. Now I'm late. Oh ! I look awful ! My hair is never gonna look good. It's stringy and ugly, and I'm fat ! Yikes, that was a little much. What a drama queen. - Our little boy's growing up. - I'm so proud. Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 17 Fagmalion, Part 3 Bye Bye Beardy sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Barry, it's okay you didn't like Broken Hearts Club or Kiss Me, Guido. Let me tell you a little secret, that we try to keep within the community. Gay movies suck. But, until the laws change, we're still obligated to go see 'em. - Will ? - In here ! Look, don't sweat it. Call me anytime. I'll see you tonight. Okay, huge news huge ! Barry has decided to shave his beard. - That's it ? - Are you kidding ? His beard is his last connection to his closeted life. Well, unless he's gonna shave it off with his feet, I still don't see the bigness. Trust me, this is a huge event in his life. And it should be marked in some meaningful way. Damn, I wish there was time to bake peanut butter cookies. Can we change the subject to something important ? What am I wearing to this party tonight ? Okay, dressing for these things, it's always a fine line. How do I turn on the gay guys without arousing the lesbians ? Heh. Barry's got a new tux. He didn't want me to see it until tonight Wanted to surprise me. Isn't that adorable ? Yeah, cute as a box of babies. Okay, this one's slitty. This one's slutty. This one's titty. This one's butty. Okay, here's some accessories and lingerie. Mix and match, enjoy. - This is gonna kill you. - I doubt it. Barry went to Barney's to pick out his first gym bag. Can you imagine what that was like ? I can And it's not very interesting. Man, the way you're going on about him, it's like you You like him. What ? Barry ? Come on, Barry's not my type. Don't give me that. I know all the signs. You talk about him constantly. You wanna bake cookies for him. Your face lights up with a huge grin - every time his name is mentioned. - No, it doesn't. Oh, for crying out loud, this is ridiculous. I just walked up a flight of stairs. What, did they put this here just so that the queens could make an entrance ? No And don't talk like that. This organization i dedicated to breaking down those kind of stereotypes. Hello, girls ! Dolly's back in town. I'm a-go working Somewhere, Rip Taylor is saying, "Now, that's faggy". - So whatcha doin' ? Waitin' for your date ? - Barry is not my date. Yet, you admit you love him. If I care for him, it is only in the way that a mentor cares for his student. You know, the way the way, in My Fair Lady, Henry Higgins cared for Eliza Doolittle. Henry Higgins loved Eliza. He grew accustomed to her face. That's love. Oh, please, if there was any love in that story, it was between Higgins and Pickering. You're nuts. Two confirmed bachelors in their late fifties whose idea of a good time is dressing Audrey Hepburn in fabulous Edith Head outfits ? Oh, they were gay, my friend. They were gay. Ladies, gentlemen, and undecided I'd like you to meet someone. He's been plucked, coiffed, buffed, and fluffed. May I present to you My cousin Barry ! Wow, he's hot ! The final test, Grace finds him attractive. He's gay, all right. Where's Will ? I haven't seen him all night. Oh, you know Will likes to do his own thing at these events. He's probably sucking down ten crab cakes before he makes a desperate move on some ugly waiter. - Hi. I'm Byron - Ah, sorry ! He's not interested. Move along. Buh-bye, Byron. Why did you do that ? He seemed great. You just rejected one of the hottest guys here. Everyone will be talking about it. Look around. Your mystique level just went up, like, 158 points. Wow, 42 more, I can upgrade to business gay. Heh-heh. Funny. But when you say something witty at a party, you should always appear bored, take a sip of your drink, and look away. That way, it'll seem like it happens all the time. Par example : Though two rights might make a wrong, a rolling butt gathers no moss. I see But that wasn't really a joke, was it ? It was pretty much just a random selection of words. Exactly My four-fingered friend. Hey, some party, huh ? I just saw two guys meet, marry, split up, and then get back together again for the sake of the Eames furniture. It's amazing, I've never seen so many good-looking guys in one room. You can include yourself in that, mister. - Doesn't he look good, Will ? - Yeah, he he looks great. Yeah. Check out his pecs. It's like he's got a granite bra on. - Come on, feel 'em. - Come on, Will, objectify me. No I got crab cake on my fingers. I need to get a crab cake removal system. There's some cute guys here, huh ? Too bad they're all 'mos. Ha ha ha It doesn't really matter to me, I'm a lesbian. Oh Honey, we're all lesbians when the right guy isn't around, huh ? Now, I wanna buy a little somethin' for my Jackie. Somethin' shiny but non-toxic, 'cause you know it's just gonna end up in his mouth. You don't buy things. It's a silent auction. You write down your bid. We'll announce the winners at the end of the night, and the money goes to help enact hate-crime laws and battle prejudice. Oh And they say lesbians aren't funny. Here's an exciting item, uh a gourmet chef comes to your house and prepares a romantic dinner for two. Yeah, I hear ya loud and clear, coach. But, uh, I just got out of a relationship, and I think it's a little early, okay ? But I think Jackie might like it. Not so fast. I want that dinner too. Well, what are you doing here, you frosted mini-wheat ? Now, you know, the plight of the homosexual is a cause dear to my wife Crystal's heart. So I plan on taking her money and purchasing that dinner for me and my business associate, Benji. Oh, I love gay events. Just got my eyebrows waxed in the men's room. Meanwhile, in the ladies room, I learned how to rewire a lamp. - What's with the puss ? - How could you do this to me ? Why would you tell me that I like Barry ? - Because you do like him. - That's not the point. I was perfectly happy not knowing how I felt. Now I feel all all raw and self-conscious, like like a stewardess without makeup. - Thanks a lot, Grace. - Stop it. You always do this. Instead of allowing yourself to feel Oh, I don't know, excited or happy or vulnerable, - you just go straight to anger. - No, I don't. Oh, really ? How do you feel about the ending of Titanic ? Oh, that was just stupid ! Of course they hit an iceberg ! Two guys in the crow's nest, a ship that big ? Come on, Will, it's okay. You can like him. I do. I like him so much. Look at him. - Ask him out. - Nah, nah, I don't know Okay, you listen to me. You are a gorgeous man, who is smart, sexy, and kind. How many deviled eggs did you have ? Okay, just go up to him, and talk to him, and say what you feel. - He'd be so lucky to have you. - I will. I will. I gotta go to the men's room. My eyebrows are too bushy. Thanks, sweetie. Yeah, that's okay. That dinner is mine, you sad, pickled woman ! It's mine, Baby Gap ! All right ! Top that Mrs. Walker. I can't. Since Stan left me, I can't throw around money with the same ease that I can throw around you. - I'm out, you happy now ? - What kind of human being would I be if I couldn't ring joy from a dear friend's misery ? Enjoy your dinner. You're short. Will. Will, look at our boy. Isn't he doing great ? I'm so proud of us. We should win an award. I don't think they give out awards for helping people be gay. Well unless you count the Tonys. Look, I gotta go to the little boys room. My hose is riding up. - You're wearing pantyhose ? - No. Come on. You go Go keep an eye on Barry. He doesn't understand how predatory some of these guys can be. Ooh, excuse me. I see a defenseless queerling who's wandered away from the flock. - Why haven't you talked to him yet ? - I'm intimidated, okay ? It's like I've I've created a guy that's too hot for me to date. It's the same reason Dr. Frankenstein didn't date his monster. What ? Dr. Frankenstein wasn't a homo. Oh, really ? He sewed together a bunch of guys to create the perfect man ? Wrapped him in linen. Give him a flat head, so you can set a drink on it. Dr. Frank was a 'mo, my friend. He was a 'mo. - Go. - No. - Oh, hey. Barry, I - Will, you've gotta help keep me away from that auction table. I'm bidding on things I don't even want. I know. I'm up to $300 on lunch and a steam with Jerry Orbach. Wow, that guy's been checking me out all night. He's not right for you ! Why ? Oh, right. Jack's rule : Never date someone white after labor day. - I'm gonna go over there. - Yeah, you know, but But Barry, don't, um Don't listen to his rules, okay. They're stupid. Except for that one about waiting half an hour after eating before dating a lifeguard. But, you know when the right guy is there, - you'll know it. - I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'm never gonna find him. You will. He may even be closer than you think. In fact, um Barry, there's something that I've been meaning to Okay, everybody, listen up. The silent auction is now officially closed. Congratulations, we've raised more money here tonight than we ever have before. We'll start by announcing our first item : A romantic dinner for two, cooked in your very own home. And the winner is - Karen Walker. - Wait, wait. Ho, whoa, what ? No ! No, no, that's impossible ! - I was the highest bidder. - You're not the highest anything ! I switched the books on you. Yeah. You've just spent a ton of Crystal's money on two front row tickets to see the Indigo Girls. Benji ! Benji ! Thank you. Thank you. Gays rule ! And to show my appreciation, I would like to give my romantic dinner to my best gal pal, Jack McFarland, to share with whoever he wants. What ? What ? I won ! I won ! I won ! Thank you, Karen ! Now, I know the question that's on everybody's lips. Who will I be sharing this dinner with ? Who ? Who, you ? No. Who ? Who ? Who Anyway, where was I ? I you know what, I'm just gonna come right out and say it. Barry - Would you go out - Would you go out with me ? - Me ? - You ? Him ? I can't believe you're asking me. Yeah, of course I would go out with you. Wow, it's just like you said, maybe the right guy was closer than I thought. And then, we got married. It was like a fairy tale. And on the first night of our honeymoon, he said something to me that I have never told anyone. You're gonna love this was Jewish. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~

I don't think that's tonight. - Please ! You're totally spying on him. - I am not. What kind of a world do you live in, when the only reason people are in a hallway is to either fart or spy ? Well, if you're not spying, then go into your apartment like a normal person. Fine. I will. Aren't you coming ? In a second.

God, I'm a fan of salad. Well, what kind of lettuce isn't in this ? It's fantastic. What are you guys doin' ? We're on a date ! Oh, my God. This is so embarrassing. I-I please, just don't let me interrupt. - Excuse me. - You wanna go out with me ? - Uh, kind of already on a date. - I don't mean now, but how quickly can you wrap things up here ? Excuse me. Tartlets for two. It's okay, I was just leaving. What do you say ? You just asked him out on a date while he's on a date with me ? Will Truman ! That is despicable ! And totally one of my moves. Out in the hall now ! Rosie ! I just met the most incredible man. Are you sure you just didn't lean into the doorknob again ? No, no. He's like a dream, like that place I go to to work. Engineering. Here to check the thermostat. Oh, that's him. Rosie, quick ! Do I look as bad as you ? - What's going on ? - Well He thinks I'm a maid. You have to pretend you're me. Okay, I'll take out my heart and sell my soul to the devil. We don't he time for that. Here, put this on. Hurry, hurry. Mrs. Walker ? That's right. Shut your mouth, maid ! My jewelry might fall out. What a monster. Who taught her to talk to another human being like that ? I have no idea. Of course, you don't. We're different from them, you and I. The rich. They think they're so much better than we are. But we have one thing they'll never have. Rickets ? - Pride. - Pride ! The true pride that comes of a hard day's work, of having friends, not possessions. Of measuring your accomplishments in love given, not dollars spent. Dollars - Will you go out with me tonight ? - Yes ! C'mon, d-do you even like him ? I like how I look when I'm next to him. And he's, he's not as cumbersome as carrying a pomeranian. Wow, you've, you've fallen harder than I thought. Look, why don't we just ask Barry who he's more interested in ? Okay, and whoever he says, that's who gets him. - Okay, fine. - Good. Now, this is a very delicate situation. I hope we can handle it - with mutual respect and dignity. - As do I. You know the best part about dating men ? A lot more slapstick. Okay, Barry, I know this is this seems weird, but we got a problem. See, I like you. Oh, sure, now that you're hot. But remember when he turned you down before, when you were hideous ? No. It's just that I now I've gotten to know you better and I want to spend time with you. - I want us to date. - But you can't date both of us, because we're best friends, and I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with Will, who wears a wig and a truss. So who are you gonna choose ? Me, who genuinely cares for you and really believes that we could make something great ? Or me. Try that. I don't know what to say. I like both you guys, you know, in different ways. But I guess if I had to pick one of you, it would have to be Will. Yes ! Yes ! What ? You're spectacular. I'm the envy of every maintenance man in this hotel. Today I walk with the pride of a bellman. Would you look at this waste ? Jerks in the penthouse ordered all this food and didn't even touch it. - You guys want it ? - Oh, yeah No ! We do not need their castoffs. Here. It's humble, but honest. Oh. Thank you. It's thoughtful, but dry. I'll get you some mayo. The mayo of the people. I've never seen a maid like you before. Where you from exactly ? Oh. I'm from Margaritaville. So, you excited about your big date ? Are you kidding ? I'm so confident about this that I've already signed us up for couples counseling. Hello. Nice shirt. Somewhere, a ballerina is shivering. Hey, Grace. What are you doin' tonight ? 'Cause I'm suddenly in the market for a new best friend. Here, let's see if we click. I'll say something witty, and then you say something back. Okay ? Let's go. I'm very handsome. - Jack, you're acting like a baby. - Oh, how droll. Let's never be apart. You're being ridiculous. Okay, he chose me over you. Do you think that makes me happy ? Stop smiling. It's unnatural on you. A smile on you is like a nice pair of legs on a chimp. C'mon. I don't feel any better about this than you do. - Stop it ! - Jack, he isn't laughing at you. He's just laughing, with me, at you. Well, I'm glad this is amusing both of you. Go on, laugh. Laugh at the sad, gay clown ! I curse your date ! A pox on both your entrees. Yeah, made the right choice. Karen, are you okay ? You haven't been to work in three days. Things are really gettin' done. It's freakin' me out. Karen ? Hello Just because I'm the new girl, they think they can give me the cart with the bum wheel ! And I'm short two shower caps and a sewing kit, and you know that's comin' out of my pay ! Housekeeping. Okay, here's a personality I've never met before. Thought I knew all of them. What's your name ? Actually, I'm kinda glad you're here. I could use some advice. Well, um, first of all You dust with the feather end, not the stick end. Hm. Better. Listen. I have this friend who lives at The Palace Hotel. And she and her maid Ro Mosario switched places so that my friend could pose as a poor, but honest chambermaid to woo a hunky maintenance man. Now my friend's fallen in love with him, and she's afraid that if she tells him the truth, he'll leave her. Hey, hands off my friend's cart ! So, you're afraid that a poor janitor might not love you because you're rich ? Not me, my friend ! Well, the way I see it is, if the guy really loves her, he'll look past the money and see a pure heart the size of a marble. Yeah. Maybe you're right. Thanks, honey. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to turn down the beds and put a mint on each pi Hey, where are my mints ? I don't know Can someone help this man ? I think he's looking for a copy of Boyfriend Stealer Weekly. C'mon, Jack. You're not still upset about me and Barry ? Okay, I guess I'll just have to stop seeing him. I mean, no guy is worth jeopardizing our friendship. Reluctant pivot, inquisitive head tilt. I mean, sure, we've had fantastic dates all week, talked and laughed, had feisty debates and comfortable silences, feisty silences and comfortable debates, silently debated the comforts of feistiness, but if our being together is gonna upset you in any way, I'll give him up. - Good. I think you should. - No way ! Are you crazy ? I'm really into Barry. He's the first guy in a long time I've felt this way about, who's not, you know, an arrow-shooting elf from Lord of the Rings. So just get over it and get happy for me. No ! If you continue dating Barry, I will never forgive you. You look older when you're angry. You're a gorgeous couple. When are you seeing him again ? Tomorrow night. Although, I was kind of thinking of dropping by his place right now and surprising him with, I don't know, Chinese food. - You think I should ? - Abs-and-pecks-olutely. It's very romantic. And moo goo gai pan is the food of love. Really ? Why do you think there's so many Chinese people ? Thanks, Jack. You're the best. Ah Bemused brow raise, shake of head. Hey, I brought some Chinese food over. I though maybe we could, uh order a pizza. That sounds really nice, but, um I kind of have plans tonight. - Oh ? Well, what kind of plans ? - Kind of a date. Oh. Okay. Um Uh, you know wh I'm just gonna say this. I like you, Barry. I don't wanna date anybody else, and I I was kinda hoping you didn't want to either. But, you were the one who said I should play the field for a while, that I won't know if I met the right guy until I see what's out there. You wanna know what's out there ? Half a million guys in lycra tank tops going, "Girlfriend !" Yeah, you could play the field for a while, but what you're eventually gonna find out is that Well I'm the right guy. So skip the middle part. Forget the dating around. I'm, I'm mid to to early 30 mish. I've done this already. - But I haven't. - Right. So now you don't have to. But I want to. Look, Will, you're great, but I've only been out a month. And I've only been good-looking a week. I need to see what's out there. I wanna do a share on Fire Island. I wanna see Cher in Vegas. I want a drag name. Something like "Kitty Litter". So, y-you you don't wanna I'm sorry. Look, um, I don't have to leave for a bit. Stay. I'll um, I'll heat up this Order a pizza. Yeah, you know, I should, um, I should go. So, I'll see you around. You're unlike any woman I've ever met. So good, so real. I know it's only been a short while, but I feel as if I know everything there is to know about you. - Me too. - I love you, Lopita. Wait. No. This isn't right. Or is it the rightest thing ever ? No. It's all a lie. I'm not who you think I am. I'm not good or real. I'm evil and imaginary. And I'm rich. Filthy rich ! - I don't understand. - I'm not a maid. I'm a snoot, a swell, a fat cat. Look at these soft, unlined breasts. They've never done an honest day's work in their lives. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. I've been looking at your breasts. My name is Karen Walker, and I'm the opposite of everything you stand for. I'm uptown, you're downtown. I'm upstairs, you're downstairs. I'm uppers I'm downers. Do you think that there's any way that you could ever love someone as rich and powerful as me ? - Sure. - Really ? Of course. You're my soul mate. I love you, rich or poor. Oh, darling. I've waited my whole life for this moment. - Let's celebrate. This calls for champagne. - I don't drink. It can't work. We're from two different worlds.

                    			Oh, Will. You're hot early. I mean, you're here, handsome. I'm sorry. Would you like some sex in your coffee ? You know, you learn a lot you get here early. For instance, I was happy to learn that the woman who vacuums and the guy who empties the trash are having an affair. I was not so happy to learn it was on my desk. Do you want me to confirm your dinner reservation with Barry ? No, cancel it. Barry and I are over. You can cancel the weekend in Key West too. I think I'd look a little pathetic in the pool having a splash fight with a blowup doll. You know, I love Key West. Yeah, well, pack your bags. I'll bring the bubbly. - Oh, God, I can't breathe ! - No, Connie, I can't - All right, I'm here. - Terrific. Everybody from The Matrix called. They want their coat back. I just wanted to make sure that you're okay after the whole Barry thing. - For the record, I never liked him. - You liked him. - I did, but he was no good for you. - He was perfect for me. He kinda was. Look, I'm fine. We we had like, what, two dates ? I spend more time on hold trying to vote for "American Idol". I guess you're right. I mean, it's not like you were planning weekend trips with him. Yeah, that'd be pathetic. Well, just so you know, I'm here for you. - Just like you're always here for me. - What do you need ? I want to borrow your apartment this afternoon. I'm making a sexy video to send to Leo. Why do you have to use my apartment ? I want to be dirty in a clean place. Well, just make sure you're clean in your dirty place. Truman. I want you to go help Short Margaret with her depositions and Black Margaret with her appeal. They're in over their heads, especially Short Margaret. Would you do that for me Gay Will ? - See ya. - Who are you ? Oh, I was just leaving. And, uh, by the way, - Barry wasn't really that cute. - He was totally cute. He was. It was a major loss. Stay strong. Sorry about that, Mr. Stein. I was sort of dating someone, and it didn't work out. It's no big deal. She's just very protective Mr. Stein, what are you doing ? I recognize heartache. My wife just left me. Well, it was 15 years ago, but I'm reliving it because of these new meds I'm taking. And if I remember correctly from our last uncomfortable hug, that's a new shampoo too. Come on, let's go have a drink. Sir, it's 8:00 in the morning. We'll have some eggs too. Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 19 Sex, Losers and Videotape sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Hi, Leo. It's me, Grace. I thought I would make you a sexy video. And why am I making this sexy video in Will's apartment ? Because things could get messy. Ew, sour strawberry, sour strawberry. Oh, bad angle. Hi, lover. What the hell ? Jack, what are you doing here ? I live here, when Will's at work. Well, get out. I'm making a sexy videotape for Leo, and I'm not going to do it with you in the room. Sweetie, baby, cookie, honey What you're sellin' I ain't buyin'. Hi, Leo, I'm back. I love to love you, baby Oh And cut. Eating and singing ? Why don't you just sit on the toilet and pick at your feet ? Excuse me, I think I know how to turn a man on. I certainly didn't pass my driver's test by learning how to parallel park. Sugar You're tryin' a little hard. - I am trying to be sexy. - But you don't have to try. You're naturally sexy. I mean, just like now. - Really ? - Well, not now. You know what the problem is ? You're too self-conscious. You need to come to my acting class. I've helped a lot of people lose their inhibitions and get in touch with their sexuality. And by theirs, I often mean mine. Forget it. I'm not taking tips from a man whose most notable credit is Shakespeare in the Pants. A'ight, suit yourself. But you watch that tape. I think you'll find yourself a little stiff. And you'll be the only one ! I really liked Barry. Why didn't he like me ? Will, love is mysterious. It's just like my wife always used to say. "Stein, you're needy, pathetic, and a rotten lover." - That doesn't make me feel any better. - How do you think it made me feel ? It's just that he's someone I could really see having a future with. I wanted to come home to him every day and say, "Hey, honey, what's for dinner ?" And he'd say, "I don't feel like cooking. Let's go out." And I'd say, "We always go out. Put down the scotch and pick up a wisk. Why are you crying now ?" It's not sexy, but it's what I grew up with. Now, when you say "he", you're talking about a man. - Yes. - But Barry is a girl. No he's a man. That's why they call you "Gay Will" ! Oh, hey, look who it is. It's Will and Grace. No, no, Karen. Karen, Karen, this is Mr. Stein of Doucette and Stein. Mr. Stein, this is Karen Walker of drunk and delusional. A pleasure to meet you. Smitty, the usual. So what are we celebrating ? Well, I'm afraid you've stumbled on a bit of a lonely hearts club. Will and I were just swapping stories about lost loves. Me and my wife, he and his gal. Guy. Well, deal me in. I've got a lifetime membership to the losers club. I've been dumped by one-ton billionaires, heads of state, and every member of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, but I'm not naming names. What's so great about another person, huh ? All they do is manhandle your boobs and eat all the ham. Yeah, and get hair gel on your pillow and rearrange your bedside figurines. And cut your ties in half and make you call yourself "Nancy". A toast love stinks. - How sad. - Hear, hear. Attention, please ! Attention ! Please take your seats. Class is in session. Thought for the day : Though the eyes are the windows to your soul, the zipper is the window to your underwear. Who is prepared to perform ? - I am. - Ah, Joanne. Always with your hand in the air. One day that hand's gonna be up in the air on Broadway. Perhaps in a musical, perhaps just hailing a cab. All right, what do you got ? I did some preparation for my audition this afternoon. - I'd like to get some thoughts. - That's what we're here for. And action. Thanks, Imodium. All right. Now, are you gonna wear your hair up or down ? Because you're trying to reach people with cramps, bloating, and explosive diarrhea. That, to me, says down. - All right, now - Hi. I'm I'm sorry to interrupt. Jack, can I talk to you just for a sec ? Well, Grace, whatever you have to say, you can say it in front of my class. We expose ourselves to each other every single day. Ooh, that reminds me. Russell, take off your shirt, and tell your lawyer to stop calling me. And scene. Nice work. Um, well, Jack, I watched the tape, and you were right. I was kind of repulsive. Oh, sweetie "Kind of" ? Do you really think that you could help me ? 'Cause I'll do anything, except whatever he did. Sure, come on up here. Come on up here. Come on. Now, we're gonna try something new today, class. It is called "Improv", which is short for improving, okay ? Okay, Grace, are you ready ? Wow, I didn't realize I was gonna have to do this in front of so many people. I mean, there's almost five of you here. Now, whatever I throw at you, you just do it. Are you ready ? And you're a cat. But sexy. You're walking in mud. Not the cat, you ! All right, forget it. All right, let's This isn't working. Let's try something a little more relatable. Okay ? Um You're a mailbox. But you're the sexiest mailbox ever. Who likes to dance An Irish jig With one leg, on fire, underwater, who's sexy - Where'd the cat go ? - Stop it ! I can't do this ! God, I'm so confused. I'm a cat. I'm a mailbox. I'm a cat box. Grace, you've gotta be more patient. I know I can help you through this. When Russell first came to me, he had no grasp of Pinter. Now he grasps his Pinter every day. Forget it. I'll just get Leo tapes from that season on "Party of Five" when Jennifer Love Hewitt's boobs grew 15 inches over two episodes. Okay. Welcome to the second meeting of the loser's club. Let me get you a drink, sir. Maybe I'll get some snacks while I'm at it. Maybe some mozzarella sticks and a big pile of peanuts. What the hell, I'm alone, right ? I might as well be fat and shiny. They ain't love handles if nobody loves ya. He's nice. - I love our little club. - Me too. - You know what I'd love more ? - Tell me. You and me making dirty on a squeaky cot. You read my mind. I just had a great idea. Let's go to the video store and take all the romantic comedies and put them in the science fiction section. - To spite. - To spite. - My tongue is double-jointed. - What ? - To spite. - To spite. I love to love you, baby. I Aaaahh ! - You sick, twisted freak ! - No, no, no, no. - Let me explain ! - You videotaped me in the shower ? - That is such a violation ! - But - I don't want to hear it ! - You were sexy ! I'm listening ! I figured if you didn't know I was there, you'd be yourself. And you where. Watch the tape if you don't believe me. You were free and uninhibited. Oh, my God, you were there for that part ? Don't worry, I'm going to score that section with violins and maybe a slide whistle for comedy. That's not what it looked like ! I'm a very thorough soaper. - On the house. - Thank you very much. We just got engaged. You sure you wanna do that ? Yeah, I love him. Sure, now. Hell, I love him now. But wait a minute and a half. Love is like a horse-drawn carriage ride. It seems romantic at first, but eventually you realize you're cold, and you're staring at an ass that craps right in front of you. - Oh, my God, you're horrible ! - Honey Come on, you were thinkin' it too. Where have you guys been ? You missed it. I think I just broke up an engagement. And they're young too. Sorry we're late, Will. Something came up. I don't get it. What's funny ? Well, things that come up are often funny, Will, especially if they haven't come up since 1997. Oh, look, look. The engaged guy's flirting with the cocktail waitress. - Which one is he, hon ? - He's right over there. Oh, look, the fiancee's coming back. I think she threw up. Sweet ! Watch them and tell us what happens. Ooh, they're fighting. Oh, my God, I hope she slaps him. Hey, I'm dry. Where's the barkeep ? Sweetie, he's right behind you. Oops ! Sorry. I thought it was her. Although it was nice. Wait a minute. Are you two Honey, that's what happens when an irresistible force meets an insane object. But we we hate love. That's our club slogan. And it's the theme of our upcoming Annual Barn Dance. Well, we were wrong, honey. Love's good, especially the third time, when you cut the oxygen off a little. That was fantastic. I thought you were trying to kill me. Stop this ! This flies in the face of everything we stand for ! - You have to break up ! - Oh, come on, Gay Will. - Aren't we allowed to be happy ? - No ! No, we're not. Love is a crapping horse ! All right, Joanne, let's try it again. And remember, you've been unjustly accused of adultery, they've taken away your children, and you've just now realized - you're blind. - Blind, got it And action. Today's winning Powerball numbers are 16, 53, 31, and 7. Okay. All right. I want you to bring it back to me again tomorrow. But this time do it as if you're really, really good. Ahh ! Don't kill me. Jack, I'm not gonna kill you, but I do need to talk to you. Okay. Class, take five. That's showbiz lingo for I'll be back whenever I feel like it. Let me just say this. One what you did to me is completely unforgivable. And two that tape was hot. So we need to make another one for Leo, 'cause I'm keeping this one. - So I helped you ? - I guess you did. Here's the key to my apartment. I am usually in the tub around 8:00. So don't come then. And next time, I'm not going to shave my legs. That part dragged a little. That's the same feedback I've been getting too I mean, you think ? I love to love you, baby You will never believe who hooked up. Alec Baldwin and Dennis Quaid ? I was just thinking about it in the shower. Karen and Mr. Stein. Can you believe that ? It's like when Drunky met Crazy. I don't know It's kind of nice. Where are they registered, the Jack Daniels distillery ? It's unnatural. Pairing up never works. When I build my ark, everyone's gonna get on one by one. Single file, no talking ! - Why do you care ? - I don't ! It's just that if you're gonna join a lonely and bitter club, you gotta at least stay bitter. Oh. I was wondering what these buttons were about. - Why are you in this club ? - Because I do care about Barry. And I did plan a trip for the two of us. I even baked him a world's best boyfriend cake. Is it in the fridge ? - Oh, Will. Why didn't you tell me ? - I can't tell you stuff like that. - Why not ? - Because you've got a guy now. You know, before, we were both losers. We'd come home from our dates, and we'd swap our loser stories. Your date would turn out to be gay. Mine would turn out to be straight. We'd laugh about it and eat some cake. - Really, is it here ? - Focus. But now you got someone. You're a winner. A loser can't tell a winner a story. Oh, sweetie, please. I can be married 100 years, and I will still be a loser. I videotaped myself in the shower, for God's sake. Wow. Is that what it takes to get you into a shower ? Really - you gonna be okay ? - Yeah, I think so. You need me to stay over for a couple of days ? 'Cause I can do it. It'd be no problem at all. - Your apartment's a mess, isn't it ? - A total pigsty. At this point, it'd just be easier to move. Will We have something to tell you. My boyfriend, Mr. Stein, and I have decided to break up. That's right, Will. Romance comes every day, but a little club like ours, that's once in a lifetime. So come on, let's go get a drink and just spit in love's eye. You just spit in my eye, sir. Well, as long as it makes you happy. You know what, guys, it's fine. Please, go back to doing whatever it was your meds led you to believe you were actually doing. I think they're cute. Who are you ? Am I the only one who sees her ? Well, Mr Stein Now that we have Will's blessing, how would you like to go back to my plush suite at the Palace Hotel ? I don't know. Now that it's not forbidden, it doesn't seem as exciting anymore. You're right. Hey, let's go pick up another couple. Awesome. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			Oh, does Jacques' have a new chef ? What is this ? It is an Eggo. Fancy. Would you mind if I put a little syrup on it ? I would not, we are not that kind of establishment. It's nice to not have anything in your head, isn't it ? Join us. We're livin' out loud. Hey, guys. Hey. You know, if you want some breakfast, I'd order now, 'cause in about a half an hour, the lunch menu kicks in. It is Hot Pockets. I'm gonna wait for the Pocket. Just a reminder, tomorrow's my birthday. Just another reminder, my husband abandoned me to help the needy, so the presents need to be bigger and better. I got you something great. You want a hint ? No ! You know I have to be surprised. Remember two years ago how upset I got when you left your present out for me to find ? "Left it out" ? It was hidden in a storage locker in Queens. That I rented under an assumed name. You bit through a combination lock. Just make sure it doesn't happen again. Oh, poor Grace. Alone on her birthday. Yeah, poor Grace. Know why I'm laughing ? 'Cause you're single ? No. I've arranged to have Leo come back early to surprise her for her birthday. - Peas and carrots, peas and carrots ? - What ? Well, how'd you do that, Willona ? It was actually easy. I chartered a camel from Mombasa to take Leo to a landing strip in Malindi where a gypsy helicopter will fly him to Nairobi. And from there, it's just a short I could have flown him direct, but it's like a hundred dollars more. I know. Good, right ? No I was laughing 'cause you know, you're single. Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 20 Leo Unwrapped sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Surprise ! I just broke my favorite bookmark. Wh where is everybody ? And why are you nude ? What are you doing here ? You're not supposed to be back till Sunday. - It is Sunday. - It's Saturday. It can't be. I left on Saturday and I've been on ten planes, and a bus, and what I'm still convinced was an anti-semitic camel. Guess that's why they wouldn't give you the kosher meal. You know, the flights were no picnic either. I had to sit through Lilo and Stitch 17 times. Not that I don't appreciate everything you did to get me here, but did you know that for only about $100 more, I could have flown direct ? Oh, you're kidding ! Wow. That, uh Will, that robe needs pants. Hey. Lotta men wear shorty robes. James Caan wears a shorty robe. Look, if there's no party tonight, I'm just gonna head home. You know, I'm exhausted, they lost my luggage, and five minutes into the flight, the stewardess spills a tray of orange juice all over me. By the time we flew over London, bees had built a hive on my lap. No, no, no. No, you can't go home. You'll ruin the surprise. You gotta stay here tonight. Look, you can crash in my bedroom, and tomorrow you can help me with the party. How are you with a pastry bag and rosette tips ? I never tried 'em, but why don't we hold each other for awhile, and we'll see how we feel after that ? What are you doing here ? It's my birthday eve. I'm alone. I'm staying over. No, you can't ! You you gotta get out of here ! Why do I have to Wait a minute You want me out ? Oh you're in a robe. Oh I smell orange juice. Oh I have no idea what's going on. All right, look, the gig is up. You want your birthday present ? 'Cause I might as well just give it to you now. No, tomorrow. It has to be on my real birthday. Well, then, you better get outta here, because it's on its way up here. No, no, wait. I don't wanna see it. Well, then, you better get out ! Not the elevator ! It might be in the elevator. Use the stairs. Okay, but first thing tomorrow morning, I'm coming over. Good, fine, go. Leave it, leave it, leave it ! Hellooo ? I need you and Karen to keep Grace busy all day tomorrow. I can't, I have plans. I just hooked up with the cute ugly guy from the Kiehl's counter at Barney's. Does he have any of that pineapple papaya facial scrub ? Because everybody's out of it. Thank you. Leo got back a day early, and I don' want them running into each other 'cause it'll ruin the surprise. No problem. I'd be happy to help. Hey, why the long robe ? Come on, get up, it's my birthday ! - Happy birthday, honey ! - Thank you. Okay. Here we are, honey. Surprise ! An arcade ? All this just to bring me to an arcade a block from my apartment ? Why did you have to cover my head ? 'Cause your hair's a disaster. Ugh I fell asleep in my clothes. You'd think after two days, this orange juice would have dried. Oh, you got a message from Air-Picture-of-a-Gazelle. - They still haven't found your luggage. - Yeah, I knew I was in trouble when my boarding pass was a coconut. I gotta get some stuff for the party. I still can't find a decent vegetable glycerin soap for the guest bathroom. It makes me insane. Anyway, help yourself to whatever's in the fridge. Unless it's marked "party". Or "Will's". Oh, and when you wipe down the counter top, use water only. You know what polished concrete's like. I can't believe you haven't found a man. I know. Oh And if you want a little entertainment, while I'm gone, I just got Xanadu on DVD. That finally came out on DVD ? I guess all my letter writing paid off. Yeah. You know, there's an extra ten minutes of roller ballet ? That's great, you know, 'cause the first time I saw it, the roller ballet felt short. I know. Okay, don't answer the phone, and stay put. Don't answer the phone and stay put. Okay, I got it. Have fun. Psst Like Xanadu ? Who doesn't ? Here you go. Ten extra minutes of roller ballet. Excellent. What's better than a Vanilla Coke and a jalapeño chili dog on your birthday ? A breath mint ? Hey, guys. Look what I got from my skee ball tickets. It's a monkey on a trapeze. I'm tired of it. Okay. Come on. I wanna go on the Dance Dance Revolution machine. You can't, Grace. Somebody's on it. Oh, let me take care of this. I'm good with kids. Hey. Puberty. Step off ! No way. Okay. Well, wouldn't it be more fun to play with my "make your own fake I. D." kit ? Cool ! Come on, Grace. You're up. Remember, just follow the arrows and try to keep up with the beat. Okay, honey, shake your booty. Shake your groove thang. Shake your Do those move ? Not only do they move, they They don't move. Okay, hit it. Oh, please. This is easy. Ooh, okay. Here we go. Crap ! Crap ! Crap ! Son of a bitch ! Now I have to pee ! Come on, Jackie. Why don't you give it a try ? I don't know, Karen. I'm not much of a dancer. Scary bathroom, scary bathroom. Gotta find a clean one. Gotta pee ! Gotta pee ! Gotta pee ! Who left the seat up ? - Sorry. That was me. - That's all right. I forgot how good that was. If it weren't for my three wives in Africa, I would have forgotten, too. Don't give me that face. You're still my favorite. You're an ass. I missed you. Me, too. You got anything to eat ? I'm starving. All Will had in his fridge was a soothing eye mask. I only got half of it down. When were you at Will's ? I wasn't. - But you just said that you were - No, I didn't. Crap. Will flew me in to surprise you for your birthday. But I got here early, so he's been hiding me in his apartment so I wouldn't ruin the surprise. Oh, my God, that's unbelievable. Wait, does that mean there's not gonna be a real gift ? I feel bad I wrecked it, you know ? The poor guy went to so much trouble. I'm not gonna go into the details, but it involved a VW bus, a leaky canoe, and a very awkward breakfast with Desmond Tutu. - Poor thing. - I know. He didn't win the Nobel Prize for chewing with his mouth closed. No. I mean, poor Will. He did all of that just to surprise me 'cause he knows just how much I love surprises. - We can't ruin this for him. - Well, surprise ! It's ruined ! Not necessarily. I mean, I know. But he doesn't know that I know. So if you go back to Will's and pretend that you never saw me, then he'll never have to know that I knew. - No. - No, "knew". No ! I'm not going back there. There's shorty robes and Xanadu, and coffee mugs that have to go in the exact same place every time ! Come on. He did this for me. Do this for him. Now, is there anything different about you from when you left Will's apartment ? I got the orange juice out of my clothes. Hey ! I hope you don't mind. I borrowed your shorty robe. Or, as the guy in the laundry room called it, my penis ruffle. You went to the laundry room ? I told you to stay in the apartment ! What if Grace had seen you ? What if Grace had been in the laundry room ? She wouldn't be doing laundry, but there is a candy machine down there. Get out here. I wanna go over the plan with you. Ah, yes. The plan. You had it laminated You say that like it's a weird thing. Okay, 6:00, you go over to Jack's and wait there. fun, fun, chit-chat, presents. Then, 7:30, you wait in the hallway, I'll open the door, you jump in and yell "surprise !". Damn it, the coffee cups go up here ! Do I have to draw you a diagram again ? - If you are gonna be a guest in this apar - I saw her, okay ? There's no surprise. What ? I I After you left, I went to our apartment and Grace saw me. You wh ? Why ? - I needed something to wear. - I gave you my clothes. Please. Your clothes are too tight on you. Great. This is the worst thing that's ever happened ! Hey, I just came from Africa. Do you have any idea how many people there are suffering from ruined surprise parties ? Wait a minute. If Grace knows, why did she send you back here ? Because she was so touched by what you did, she asked me to play along so I wouldn't spoil the surprise. This is supposed to be her surprise, but she's more concerned about my joy at seeing her surprised than her own joy at being surprised ? Dude, I don't know. I'm just happy to have a dry crotch. Wait, wait we gotta proceed with this plan. You can't tell her I know. It's over, Will. She knows. Yeah, she knows, and I know, but she doesn't know that I know she knows. It can still work. All must be as it was. Oh, my God This game is amazing ! Honey, look, I'm winning, I'm winning ! Karen, that's a change machine. I don't care what you call it. Where do we cash in these buttons ? Where have you been ? You were gone so long we had to eat your funnel cake. Wait a minute. We're not the only ones eating your funnel cake. You had sex. Come on, give it up. Who was it ? I ran into Leo. But you can't tell Will I found out. I mean, I know. But he doesn't know I know. And now that you know I know, you can't let Will know that you know I know, you know ? No Do you know ? I think I know. But I'm sure I don't care. Okay, you fill him in. I need to go pee again. Oddly, the bathroom here is cleaner than the one at home. Poor Grace. Her surprise is ruined. Right ? We should help her, Jackie. It's her birthday. She deserves a real surprise. Now put your thinking cap on. What would be a bigger surprise than Leo showing up ? Blanket Michael Jackson, I've got it ! Leo not showing up. Karen, it's beautiful. Thank you. You're welcome, honey. Happy birthday. Oh, and See this one right here ? It's pure cyanide. So if you're ever in a jam, just bite down hard. Wear it in good health. - Now, now me, me, open mine. - Thanks, Jack. I wouldn't get too excited. It's probably just another one of his headshots. It's not a headshot. Okay, it's a headshot. Oh, and look. An updated résumé on the back. Ooh, 7:30. Time for my present. And it's a big one. Now, let me see That's funny. Could have sworn I brought it in here. Maybe it's in the hallway. What kind of present would be in the hallway, I wonder ? What do you think it is ? I hope it's another party, 'cause this one's a snooze. - Happy - Oh, my - Where is he ? - Wait a minute, what do you mean, "he" ? - Leo. - You knew he was coming ? Of course I knew. Didn't you know I knew ? Yeah, I knew you knew, but I didn't want you to know I knew you knew. That I did not know. I just kept up this whole charade 'cause I wanted you to have a good surprise on your birthday. I only did it so that you would have the fun of surprising me. Happy birthday. Thank you, sweetie. So where's my husband ? Surprise ! He's not coming ! Man, we got you ! Okay, come on. Come on, seriously, where is he ? We're not sure. No. Once we drove him out of town and dumped him in a ditch, it's anybody's guess. - What were you thinking ? - You threw him out of a car ? Hey, calm down. We just thought that it was so sweet that you wanted to surprise Grace and that she wanted to let you surprise her and, well, we just wanted you both to get what you wanted. Wait Does any of this look familiar ? Yes, I remember passing this orchard. Oh, there he is ! Holding up all those apples. That's an apple tree, brainiac. Wait. I smell orange juice. Pull over. Pull over ! Why, look, it's Leo. But I thought he was in Africa. Surprise ! Oh, my god, I had no idea ! This is the best birthday ever ! - Who wants cake ? - No, no cake, please. I've been stuck out in the cold for two hours. I'm freezing, I'm covered in mud, a weirdly-aggressive deer just tried to mate with me. Oh, now I know where we are. There is no surprise, okay ? We all know it. He knows, she knows, and they know, we know, and you know he knows she knows, and she knows they know and now everybody knows. I know, so just stop pretending ! Ah, screw it.

You have enough underwear to last you two months ? What is this place ? It's pretty. Where are the fish ? No, Karen. It is a "laundry-mat." People come here to clean their clothes Then, they reuse them. Why, poor people are just plain clever. I wonder why they can't figure out a way to make more money. You've never been to a laundromat before ? Whatwhy am I surprised ? Last week at the post office, you kept tapping on the window and feeding peanuts to the clerk. Why, there's so much real-life I've never experienced. Sectional sofas for sale missing cats battered women shelters Fun ! Honey, look at me I'm finally using the Internet ! Yeah !

I tell you, you walk down Columbus Avenue with two rolls of quarters in your pocket you get a lot of attention. Thanks. Now, what's happening on your feet ? I think she's talking about your shoes, Heidi. What ? They're clogs They're good for your back. They're good for the back of your closet. You know what, the hell with both of you. I like 'em. I'm gonna wear 'em. Damn it ! I fell off my clog ! Not funny, I think I did something bad to my foot. Well, you did that when you put the clogs on this morning ! Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 21 Dolls And Dolls sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Will called from the doctor I guess he actually sprained something. So I guess it's just going to be you and me for the good old-fashioned foldin' party. Grace, just because you say the words "good old-fashioned," doesn't make it a party. Even though I made a good old-fashioned foldin' party mix tape ? Okay, now it's a party. Do you see ? Do you see why it's a party ? - Hey, what's the big idea ? - It is such a great song I think we should save it for sock bundling. You know, we would never have this much fun if Will were here. You know, he practically ruined my good old-fashioned find-the-bad-smell party. Why does he always have to be in such a bad mood ? With those With those angry arms. Stop taking my money ! Stop leaving crumbs on the carpet ! Stop making fun of my angry arms ! Yup, sometimes he could be a little mean and intense. Wow. Do you think he'd ever kill us ? No, come on It's Will. Maybe you should move your glass off the coffee table. Pick up the glass ! Wipe down the ring ! You're right, first he sees The Ring, and then we die ! Hey, what're you guys doing ? I- I-it's a good old-fashioned folding party. It was Grace's idea ! Take her, she has funny genitals ! A good old-fashioned folding party ? Why is it all you have to do is add "good old-fashioned" to something and you got yourself a good time. I hope you saved the fitted sheet for me. It's fun to pretend it's a giant shower cap. Areare you okay ? Yeah. Oh, I mean I was I was in a lotta pain. But then, the doctor gave me these painkillers, and I feel a lot better. About everything, actually. Oh ! No good. Wow. Cheery Will I like it. Unless he's cheery because he's back there loading his gun ! So I had this apartment to myself for 10 years because I was having an affair with my boss. And he paid half the rent so we'd have some place nice to "do it." But then he got murdered. And I-I couldn't really afford it on my own. So what's your story ? Well, since my marriage ended I've been living at The Palace. And even though I've made a lot of swell friends, it's lonely. I wanna a real home with, um, with real people. I mean, you're real, right ? Super real. Okay, true or false ? I'm easy to live with. - True. - False. I'm a nitpicker supreme. I think it comes from all my years as a professional in the music biz. You're in music ? Yeah, I-I didn't want to put it on the ad because then, you know you just get a bunch of wannabes knocking on the door I'm an office manager for the company that does those collections you see on T.V. You know, Hits of the '80s, Ladies of the '80s Rock Ballads of the '80s. The '90s. Well, I can see why you'd wanna keep that a secret, Liz. I mean, you must never know if people are really liking you just for you or the '80s hits. So, um, you should know that you know I- I like things done a certain way. Just ask Melissa and Keith. They work under me. Like, if they're five minutes late for work, I look at my watch I look at them and they just get it. Oh ! Oh, my God. I totally just bragged. Please tell me to shut up. Cut to me still talking about myself. Um, Liz I know we haven't known each other very long but I think that you might be just about the most interesting person I've ever met. - I could learn tons from you. - Okay, okay, true or false ? - I think you're great - Um False. - True ! - Oh, this game is so hard ! Oh, Jack. Look, have you seen Will ? I've been tryin' him for a couple of days and he hasn't returned my calls. Yeah, I think he's home. He didn't go to work ? Is he all right ? Is his ankle worse ? Grace, I'm trying to run a business. Hey, sweetie. Look ! TiVo saved all the "American Idols" for me. I love Paula Abdul. And I love that we live in a world that would give a Paula Abdul a second chance. - Uh, why aren't you at work ? - Oh, I'm sick. My ankle still hurts. Oh, have you ever seen "King of Queens" ? It's funny sometimes ! But I don't really believe that she'd stay with him Or do I ? No, I don't think I do. Well, I don't have to settle this right now. Oh, hey ! I made cookies. Oh, thanks, sweetie. Oh, boy. There's chocolate on the carpet. I'm sorry. What a mess. - Eh, leave it. - Okay, now you're freakin' me out ! There are crumbs on the carpet your robe doesn't match your socks and, oh, my God there's no product in your hair ! I'm calling 9-1-1 ! I'm fine. You know I- I got those nice little pills. - Ooh, better call in a refill. - Already ? Little secret: if you cheat and take 'em a little closer together you can avoid the pain completely. It's even pretty effective in squashing the lingering ache from having to work so hard for my mother's affection making it nearly impossible for any man to love me enough to make up for the hole she left in my heart. That may have been the greatest day of my life. I love errands. They're like mini adventures for undesirables. Okay, so your half of the bill is $30.45 and don't try rounding it down like my last roommate 'cause that is just "F'd up." Well, you don't have to worry about me, Liz. I intend to pull my own weight around here. Now, did you take a look at the chore wheel ? Because you're in charge of emptying the ant traps and organizing the CD tower. How did I go my whole life without ever learning any of those words ? Karen ! You shouldn't have bought this cheesecake. I'm, like, totally eating healthy this week. Cut to me eating this whole cheesecake. Oh, Liz. I love when you do "cut to me." Everybody does. Oh, Lizzie. I rented us a video. You are going to get me into so much trouble. If you're lucky. - You're crazy. - Like a fox. - I doubt it. - You wish. - Don't I ever. - You and what army ? I'm so glad we're roomies. You know, I've lived with men practically my whole life. I didn't know what I was missing. I mean, the bond that can grow when two single gals share a tacky apartment with too many clocks and vanilla candles. You know what, Karen ? Guys just mess everything up Or get murdered. We are strong independent career women. - We don't need men to make us happy. - You said it, sister So you wanna go see if we can get laid ? Totally. - That's weird. - Looking for these, Miss Taylor ? What're you doing here ? Give me those. No. We're not going to let you do this to yourself. We think you have a problem And we ate all your Mueslix. - Who's "we" ? - We wanna help you, Will. - Get out of my apartment ! - No. You have a problem. You have got to get off gotta get off this merry-go-round. - I want those pills ! I have pain ! - Effie, we all got pain ! Look, we understand. You're an elderly gay man with a poochie tummy and an unappealing personality. Why wouldn't you be in pain ? I Wait a minute, those aren't even my pills. Those are just old antibiotics. They are ? Crack whores are sneaky ! Oh, wait, look ! These pills have become a crutch. And these crutches have become a coat rack. Damn, you're right. Okay, we'll do it your way. I'll just, uh bring in the paper and we'll make a pot of coffee Start a whole new day. - We're good friends. - Smart of us to catch on. - He's not coming back, right ? - No, no, I don't think so. Thanks, Tony. That's Tony. When I first start coming here I thought he was gross. Cut to me flat on my back on his futon. God, this is great. Casual sex, mookie bartenders, dirty futons This is the stuff of life I'm gonna get an S.T.D. tonight ! - Man, I am so buzzed. - You wanna French ? Not right now. I got my eye on this guy. I think he's really into me or at least he's gonna be. I got my eye on some one too. Let me look for him. There he is ! Kurt ! - Wait, you can't like him. I like him. - But I like him too. Well you have to back off. Because it's the first rule of being a good roommate. - You can't go after the same guy. - Then why don't you back off ? - Because I saw him first. - How do you know ? - How do you know I didn't ? - Damn, your street smarts. - I'm going for him. - I'm going for him too ! - Hey, Kurt, mind if I join you ? - Well, I'm kinda dancing with her. Or would you rather be dancing with an office manager ? - You know, I was here. - And now you're gone. Hey, Kurt, check this out. Hey, Kurt, look at me ! - Here I am. I'm your lady, Kurt. - Take it, take it. Kurt, have you been working out ? - Wait, you're not Kurt ! - You're not Kurt either ! Now look what you've done. Me ? You scared him off with your big boobies and your weird bisexual vibe. He was into me ! No one's into you. You're an oddly confident I'm a professional in the music business with two people working under me. Melissa and Keith hate you ! - Take it back ! - No ! Yes ! Oh ! You ripped it This is everybody's favorite top on me ! Who's "everybody" ? Melissa and Keith ? They hate you ! Come on, feel good buddy. I know there's one in here. Damn tic-tacs ! - Will, stop. - Get outta here. We are not leaving ! The pain is in your head, Will ! And now you're hooked on the junk ! I fell off my clog ! At some point, every one falls off their clogs but you gotta get back on your clogs and work through the pain. And even though you may wanna take off your clogs again you gotta keep 'em on. Will. Let me show you something It's not going to be pretty. Come on. Come on, man ! Look at yourself. Now, look at me. I am adorable. Now back to you. You look awful ! I look the same. Outta my way, you're blocking my view. Will, you have to face it. You're not yourself. You haven't been to work in three days. You threw your dry cleaning on a chair. You told your mother that you'd call her back. And then you did. My God, what's happened to me ? You know, of all my bad roommate experiences this has been the third worst. That born-again Asian queen with a guinea pig was a better roommate than you ! Yeah ? Well, of all the bars I've ever been kicked out of that one had the best onion blossom. News flash: I want you out. You're a sucky roommate ! What ? You mean you're gonna end our friendship over some man in Dockers with Red Bull breath ? I could've loved him. I want you to write me a check for the rest of the month's rent and get out. You know, I just wanted to try a new experience. Make it out to the landlord "Walker Property Management." Oh, and add on $1.09 You ate one of my yogurts. Let's see, how do I break this to you ? True or false ? I own this building. True. Yeah, I am Walker Property Management and I think I want you out. Wait a minute ! We're roommates. We're friends, we could be lovers I'll take that French now. Sorry Lizzy Boredom you've left me no choice. That's right, cut to you living in a dumpster. Feeling any better ? Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't know what happened to me. I was really out of control. But I guess I had to hit rock bottom before I could admit I had a problem. Will. It was three days. Really ? God I was so whacked out it seemed like a long weekend. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~

You know you how you always get hungry an hour after veal parmigan ? So, K, how's it going with the divorce ? Do we know what we're getting yet ? Well, we'll find out next week after the hearing but I'm not worried. All we have to do is show that Stan cheated on me which the filthy pig did, no hard feelings. May he rot in hell, I love him to pieces, the fat turd. - And I get half of everything. - Can I have half of that ? - I may even get more than half. - Me too. Because I've got the best lawyer in town in my corner one Miss Wilma Truman. Drop trou' and take a bow, honey. Uh, Karen, I can't represent you. Stan is my firm's biggest client. I just assumed you knew I'd be representing him. Well, I didn't know. I just assumed that you and I were friends. Well, I'll show you, missy. I'll get another lawyer. A better lawyer. A gayer lawyer ! Yeah, well, good luck finding that. Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 22 May Divorce Be With You sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Well my lawyer should be here any minute. Are you nervous, nelly ? Look, Karen, I know it's awkward being on opposite sides but there's no reason this case should get in the way of our lukewarm friendship. Wait till you meet this guy. He's a killer. He'll make a monkey of you. But, of course, with your hairy back that shouldn't be much of a leap. Hey, Mrs. Walker, sorry I'm late. I figured, since I'm a lawyer now I should probably have a suit. I stopped off at The Men's Wearhouse but my credit card got declined. So I had to call my mom but not to worry. I got the suit, and I'm ready to get medieval on law's ass. - Will Truman. - Oh, hi. I've heard of you. I'm Jason Towne but all the kids at law school call me "JT". Well, uh not all of them. Some of them call me Soupy 'cause, you know, I like soup. What, uh, do I have a boog ? No, no, no. No boog. Uh, I just You just seem very young. That could just be me. The other day I realized that the guy at Starbucks that I've been calling "Sport" is actually 32. Wow, 32 scary. - So, uh, you guys ready to party ? - Fire it up, Soupy. I'm buggin' out. I can never get this thing open. Yeah, they're kinda complicated. Wait till you get car keys. Can I see you outside for a second, please. Sure, hon. Oh, sweet ! My mom put in a Kudos. He's a cutie, isn't he ? Pretty lips. He's an infant. Where'd you find him the Montessori School of Law ? Hey, for your information, he just won Deborah Harry a huge settlement from the tabloids for saying that she showed up at the market with undies on her head. Which she did. I'd show you pictures but I sold them to the tabloids. Karen Your case is complicated. It involves math and reading. I'm afraid this kid is too green. You're the one who's green green with envy.

Jack, thanks for filling in for Karen. You know, it's kinda slow today. So you could help me organize the back room. Oh, today's not slow. You have a client coming in any minute. Client ? What are you talking about ? How do you even know that word ? Well, I took a little "inish" and got you a meeting with an associate of mine. And by "associate," I mean friend. And by friend, I mean lover. And by lover, I mean And by I mean wealthy. - How wealthy ? - He's got a TV in the bathroom. Oh, what a great idea. 'Cause I miss so much TV when I'm in there. Sorry, no public displays of affection. They don't know I'm gay here. I guess that means you haven't spoken or moved. Come on. All this, and I get to take a bath and watch Everwood. And sometimes I turn on the TV, okay. - Grace, Cam. Cam, Grace. - Hello, I'm Grace. I just want to say I love everything you're wearing and I'm furious I didn't get those glasses first. They're just for show. I got them at an estate sale. They're actually killing my eyes. Pretty soon I'm gonna need glasses. - What about her ? - Did I tell you, did I tell you ?

Mrs. Walker's case is like, mad complicated. They keep on sending me all these papers and these folders. I can't make any sense of any of it. Can you help me ? I'm the opposing counsel. Yeah, but you're cool, right ? No, I'm not cool. I'm uptight and moody. Which is not really the point. I- It's unethical for me to help you. But, but I'm gonna lose the case and Mrs. Walker's gonna lose like, thousands of dollars. Millions. Millions ? Dang that's a lot of cheddar, yo. That's craz-azy cheddar. Look, all you have to do is is prove that Stan violated the prenup - and Karen gets half of everything. - That would be awesome. Like how ? How ? How did you get Debbie Harry the huge settlement ? Dude, I didn't represent Deborah Harry I was, like, born during her comeback. That was my dad's case. I didn't realize there was a Soup Senior. Look There's a fidelity clause in the agreement. You prove that Stan violated that, and you're set. Oh, boy. Look, you didn't hear this from me but you might want to check out their surveillance tape from the prison. They keep a record of all activity. You might be able to figure out when Stan and his mistress hooked up. Okay. Then what ? Well, then you can prove that Stan Violated The fidelity Fidelity cl Clams ? Yes. Stan violated the fidelity clams. Clause ! He violated the fidelity clause ! Mr. Walker violated the fidelity clause ? That's huge. Can you prove that ? Yes ! This is Grace Adler of Grace Adler Designs. I was in there yesterday. I told you I would be back today.

Oh, and mister, don't think we've forgotten about you. Guess who's getting a panic room with its very own stripper pole. I don't know Maybe Cam's new boyfriend. He dumped me in a restaurant. It was harsh. So was the lighting. He gave me this watch to remember him by. He doesn't know it yet. Oh, Jack, I am so sorry. Yeah, well, Grace I'm so sorry for you too. I'll be okay. Wait. What ? Well, I mean now you have to quit. What kind of friend would you be if you kept working for the man who broke my heart ? But, Jack, if everybody stopped working for men who broke your heart the city would shut down. - Grace, hey. - Uh, look, Cam, we need to talk. What's the matter ? I can't do this. I can't be your designer. Why ? What happened ? I thought it was going so well We clicked. We were having fun. I know. It's just that that Jack's my friend and this really doesn't feel right anymore. Oh, are you sure ? 'Cause this morning I decided to the hell with the budget I want the leather walls. Oh, my God ! I love doing leather walls. No, no, I can't. It's it's not right. Or is it so right ? We can still work together. Jack doesn't have to know. Stop, you're confusing me. - I'm sorry. I have to go. - I have a giant house. It's in the country and it's enormous. I want you to do it Will you do my giant house ? Cam, I'd love to. You know I'd love to, but I can't. Okay, I understand. But tell me, just for fun if you were to do my giant house what would you do to it ? I don't know. Sure, you do. Describe it to me. Well, I'd have to know how big it is. I mean, you say it's giant. But a lot of clients exaggerate. Damn. I don't care what anyone says. Size does matter. And I have a friend at Architectural Digest. He wants to do an article on the renovation. I see a picture of you in whatever we renovate doing this. I love doing this. Especially in pictures. All right, I'll do it. But only in the country house. The city is too risky. If Jack sees us together he'll never forgive me. I'll get my checkbook. I'll get my swatches. They're in the bathroom. I left them there yesterday when I was watching Oprah. Hello, Cameron. Sorry to bother you. Especially since I'm a Oh, how did you put it Shrieking infant with the attention span of a fly. But I left my Legos here. What did you do with them ? Here. Now please you have to go. Ok, but, they better all be here. Why are you in such a hurry to get rid of me ? Do you have another man here ? Cam, I can't wait to get my hands on your Jack ! Grace ! You lied ! You do have another man here ! - And you, how could you do this to me ? - Jack, let me explain No ! I don't wanna hear it ! I'll be leaving now. It looks like I'm the only one around here with any integrity. Is that my watch ? I will not dignify that with a response. Karen Will, what are you doing here ? I'm having lunch with my attorney. I guess this is where you go when you have a lawyer on retainer who wears a retainer. Hey, those are invisi-braces. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. Your lawyer's incompetent. He's a nice kid. Take him skateboarding. Sneak him into an R-rated movie. But for God's sake, do not let him represent you in a multi-million-dollar divorce case. What do you know ? He happened to have won a number of high-profile cases. Like what ? Bert v. Ernie ? How dare you ? That's mad insulting. You think that I can't tell when someone's incompetent ? Check out all these fries. I only paid for a small, but score ! - What's up, bro ? - Hey dog. I'm leaving. Think about what I said. What was he doing here ? Well, Will thinks, and I may be starting to agree, that you could be the wrong lawyer for me. You have no experience, your suit doesn't fit and you giggle every time you say pro bono. Bono. Okay, that's funny. But I don't know, JT I think maybe I better let you go. This is too important to me. and I can't afford to lose. Oh, we're not gonna lose this case. He is. And you want to know why ? 'Cause I tricked him. See, I walk into that room with my backpack and my big suit talking about my iguana. I don't have an iguana. I'm a lawyer. I drive a Mercedes as big as a house. And I totally got Deborah Harry that settlement. And do you want to know how she thanked me ? By rocking my world in the back of that Mercedes, that's how. You feel me ? How would you like to live under my skirt ? Your dumb-ass friend spoon-fed me everything I need to win your case. His client's gonna lose his shirt and Truman's gonna lose his job. You chew on that. I'll see you at the hearing tomorrow. Oh, yeah, here. Get yourself a bikini wax. I like a clean work space. Jack, come on. Open up. I know you're home. I can hear your tap shoes. What do you want ? You're interrupting my tech rehearsal. Boys and girlie boys, take five. Look I feel terrible. I went there to break it off. And then we started talking and one thing led to another. Before I knew what was happening he whipped out his checkbook and I was showing him my carpet samples. Well, you hurt me, G. I know, which is why I ended it once and for all. I am never seeing him again. Yes, would have been the best job I ever landed But your friendship means too much to me. Hm, Thanks for doing that, G. Jack, sweetie we need you back. That dance captain thinks he's Fosse, but he's just bossy. Hey, Grace. Yeah, we're back together. After you guilted me into quitting a job that would have landed me in Architectural Digest doing this ? I can't believe you did this to me ! Oh, Grace. Here's the advance on your design fee. Thanks, I'll see you Friday. - You're still working with him ? - Well, you're still dating him. - You're a terrible friend ! - You're a worse friend. Eh. What are you gonna do ? What's up, Truman ? Ready to throw down ? Well, look at you. I didn't think OshKosh B'Gosh made power suits. You surprised to see me ? Karen told me you tried to get me fired. Did I get fired ? No. Look, JT, I just didn't think you were up to handling Karen's case. Some of these hearings can run past 9:00. You don't get it, old man. I've been playing you like Pong. That's a game from your era, isn't it ? So what, this was all an act ? How evil ! How sneaky ! How underhanded ! My God, you are a lawyer. So, uh, thanks, bud. This surveillance tape's gonna come in real handy when I hand you your balls in court. Not so fast, Soupy. The only one handling Will's balls will be Will. - Yeah, but I can crush his balls. - Excuse me. They're in the room. Will's my friend and I'm not gonna let you do anything to hurt his career. So you're canned, Soup. You don't want to make that mistake, baby. JT, give us a minute, will you, please. Holler if you hit puberty. Look, if you're doing this to protect me, don't. I can handle myself. He may be young and pretty but I am old and irregular. Which makes me mean. Which makes me a good lawyer. Are you sure, honey ? 'Cause I'd hate to see that kid nail you in there right before he nails me in here. - Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. - You're sweet. You really take good care of me, don't you ? Despite my better judgment. - I'm still gonna kill you, you know. - Bring it on, Mary. Hey, Little Man Tate you're back on. For reals ? Psych. You're going down, pops. P.S., today's soup is cream of I'll kick your ass. I hope you know what you're doing. Your childish tricks aren't gonna work in there. You're playing with the grownups now, my friend. Whatever. After you. Team W&G ~seriessub.com~   
                




                    			Gosh, Grace, it was so sweet of you to cook Will and Karen dinner. Well, you know, I just figured after a long day at the divorce hearing it would be nice to come back to a home cooked meal. You're so generous. I swear, if you weren't Jewish you'd definitely go to heaven. Thanks, Jack. And if you weren't gay you'd go there too. Who does that Stanley Walker think he is ? Trying to cheat me outta half of his fortune ? I gave that man the drunkest years of my life ! Oh, you've still got some good drunk years ahead of you, I bet. Oh, and you two wouldn't believe the lawyer that Stan has. Hmm, this Truman fella. Tricky little queen. Mincing around the conference room "I object, move to strike." Yeah, he was a riot. You know who else was something ? The pill-popping shrew trying to get her hands on Stan's money. Falling asleep on the conference table waking up with a shriek, throwing up a little in her purse. Guys, guys, come on. Let's relax. Nobody got hurt, nobody got outed. - Yay ! It's ready. - Grace, I wanted to say that ! A "yay" is better from a gay. Look, Will. We've been cooking. Oh, a cuisine of Chef Boy-are-you-lazy. Hey, we were just trying to do something nice. Sorry, if it wasn't as fancy as you would've done it. With your squeezing pepper and your stirring things in bowls. Sorry, it's just been a difficult day watching Joan Crawford address PepsiCo. Oh, yeah, real rough day for you. Meanwhile, my soon-to-be ex-husband is trying to screw me over. I am never speaking to that man again. I mean it, I'm done ! Miss Karen. - I have awful news. - What is it, Rosie ? Because this day couldn't possibly get any worse. It's Mr. Stan. He's dead. Hey, hey, I got off work early. Picked up a couple of sixes, I found a 20 on the street. Damn, it's good to be alive ! What ? Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 23 sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ I can't believe Stan is gone. I feel so bad. Maybe I could've saved him. The man died schtupping his mistress. I don't see how you could've saved him. The point is the randomness of it all. People die. I might die. Even worse, I might get old. Really old. - And we're back to Grace. - I don't think we really ever left. Hey, buddy. That suit I couldn't find this morning looks good on you. It's like a vacation for the seams. - Hey, Karen. - I'm so sorry, Karen. - Could I get in on that ? - Sure, you big softie, come on. - Rosie - Yes, Miss Karen ? - Could you do me a favor ? - Anything, Miss Karen. Could you go into the chapel and Lemon Pledge my pew ? Like you had to ask. I'm gonna go and make sure all the unattractive people are in the back. You shouldn't have to bear anymore pain today. Hey ! Lazy eye in the back ! - Will, Will. - I'm right here, sweetie. No, Will, when can I see the will. You're very upset. I don't think now is a good time to talk about that. I know, honey, it's just that I'm feeling so many emotions Loss, anger, sadness. Knowing how much money I'm getting would really snap all of that into focus. Well, I'm not really sure I- I haven't seen the latest version. Huh what huh latest huh ? Yeah, Stan came in to see his estate attorney a couple of weeks ago. I remember because it was the day that I tried the Rock deodorant and they asked me to leave at 3:00. They changed his will Why would he do that ? Looked what my husband's cash dragged in. How could this happen, Letty ? My Stanley, my little man. I could still remember his last words. "I'm I'm" and then he was gone. - Lorraine. - Karen. - Back-up maid. - Miss Karen. Nice outfit for a funeral. If that dress were any shorter I could see your English muffin. I wouldn't talk. If that dress were any lower I could see your yankee doodles. You're a natty dresser. Are you English ? Oh, no, I'm gay. Well, it's the same thing. If that weren't true I'd find it offensive. Come on, Karen. Let's go inside. Darling. Darling. I know this is a sad day for both of us. But I just want you to know one little thing. I'm getting it all. Well, then, maybe you can treat yourself to some underpants. Stanley Walker touched so many people's lives. He was a wonderful husband a loving father a respected businessman His absence will leave a huge void in our lives that cannot possibly be filled. All right, enough with the fat jokes. And now a reading from Psalm 23. "The Lord is my shepard" I don't know what I'd do if you died. I hope I go first. Then again, you love me so much that would be unbearable for you. Yeah, you should die first. Definitely you. Can I go in my sleep or you looking for me to suffer ? Hey, look at her. I know. We hate her. We hate her even more than the know-it-all daughter on "The Gilmore Girls." Is that tart flipping me off ? Oh, I can't take it anymore. Wilma ! Listen, I need to see that will and I need to see it right now. Chop chop ! What're you suggesting ? That I page a lawyer on the weekend and have him run the will over here ? Drag some guy all the way to Westchester ? Clear this place out in the middle of a funeral and start talking dollars and cents ? Sounds good. Oh, all right. I wouldn't ordinarily do this but I'm dying to try my new Blackberry. Why do you need to see the will ? Stan changed it. She might get everything. Damn her ! I am never speaking to her again. And now, a moment of silence as we reflect on the life of Stanley Walker. Sorry. - Turn it off, Leo. - Good idea, Grace. Hello ? Oh, hey, how are you ? I'd like you to have all your things out by tomorrow morning, all right ? I'd like you to eat me. An number of people have offered to share their memories of Stanley Walker. And first up is his Well let's say, friend. Lorraine Finster. Thank you, Kevin. Stanley Walker was a giant bear of a man. And underneath that giant bear was a smaller bear. And underneath that bear was me. Gasping for air. When I first met Stanley I was working in the cafeteria of a white collar prison. At the time, I was deeply involved with the handsome embezzler who led a major telecom company into bankruptcy. When I laid eyes on Stanley all thoughts of other criminals were forgotten. - Stanley Walker was a great man. - A big man. A fat man. - But he was also a kind man. - A family man. A surprisingly good dancer. Whenever he stopped by my office he would always bring tulips. I don't like tulips so I'd go down to the Korean market and exchange them for other flowers or a salad. Or those little fig cookies that come three to a pack. They're always up by the gum. You know which ones I'm talking about ? He was an accomplished Etch-a-Sketch artist. I'd like to show you one he did for me. I will always remember you Stanley Walker. Always remember you, Stanley ! Hey, where did it go ? I'll miss his humor He loved a good knock-knock joke. Whenever I saw him he always had a new one for me. Well, today, I have one for you, Stan. Knock, knock. - Knock. Knock. - Who's there ? Will. Will who ? "Will" miss ya, Stan. And now, to say a few words is Stan's loving second wife Karen Walker. Two people are wearing your dress. Most of you know about the recent trouble Stan and I have had. Just in case you don't I'll get you up to speed. The British whore killed him. But the truth is we really did care about each other. I guess what I'm trying to say is I want you all to leave so I can find out what's in his will. I'm not kidding if you're not in the will, please exit. The good people at Neutrogena have provided wonderful gift bags. Please pick one up on your way out. Leo, where were you ? It was kind of an important phone call. Doctors Without Borders. They're opening a new clinic in Guatemala and they they want me to come help set it up. Guatemala ? You're going back to Africa ? Yes, yes, and remind me to buy you an atlas. I can't believe this. You just got back - and now you're leaving again ? - Can I just say something No, how could you be so insensitive ? I mean, you have no sensitivity You're like the opposite of sensitive. And while I'm at the bookstore I'll pick up a thesaurus for you too. I'm glad that this is funny to you. Ha, ha, big joke. "My wife's dumb." Ha, ha. "I know more than one word that means insensitive." Whoo-hoo ! Would you shut up. You freak, I want you to come with me ! Oh. Wait, are you really asking me or are you just asking - 'cause I kinda yelled at you ? - I'm really asking you. Baby, I want you to come. This this is what I do And and you're you're who I do. I- I just wanna be able to do who I do, while I do what I do. - You do ? - I do. Guatemala ! I'm going to Spain ! Oh, Kare. I'm sure you don't have anything to worry about. Stan sure loved ya. He'll make sure you're taken care of. I don't know, honey. That Cockney sucker had some kind of power over him. For all I know, she could've talked him into signing everything over to her and leaving me nothing. Huh. 'Scuse me for a second Hi, Lorraine. How you hanging in there ? Well, it's tough, Jackie. I mean, I've been touched by death, haven't I ? I was also touched by Stan's nephew. Filthy little rascal tried to bugger me in the rectory. Well, you do have a very pretty rectory. If everyone could please take their seats. We'll get started. "I, Stanley Evelyn walker being of sound mind do hereby bequeath the following My cured meat room and all the contents therein shall be divided as follows. All hanging salamis and domestic hams will go to my son Mason for reasons that will be clear to him. My prosciuttos, mortadellas and the best of my wursts go to my beloved daughter, Olivia. The entire contents of my jerky room" "shall be all chutneys Preserves and jams, including but not limited to, mustards shall go Rufus Huang of Empire Szechwan. Thanks for the deliveries." What ? Ten trips a day and three back surgeries, all I get is mustard ? Thanks for nothing, fatso ! - "Regarding my monetary assets" - I'm pulling for you, Kare. Fingers crossed, Lorraine. "First and foremost, for her years of undying love and loyalty I leave to my dear, dear maid, Rosario the sum of $10 million dollars." I'm free ! I'm free from that evil witch. I hope you rot and I hope it hurts. "To be paid upon the completion of 20 more years of service to Karen Walker." Can I get you a soda ? Maybe later. Like in 2016. "To someone whom my second wife, Karen always held in such regard and spoke of with great affection" Oh, my God, that's me. "Grape Antler." "I leave you my life-sized oil painting of Karen so you never have to be far from her." Oh, crap. Maybe I can trade with that Chinese food guy. "And to two of my favorite people whose commitment to each other has inspired me to look for love in my own life I leave the sum of $20,000. Will Truman and Jack McFarland get married already." Did you just propose to me ? No ! I was reading the thing. I guess Stan thought you and I were a couple. Kiss him ! You gotta be kidding me. This is ridiculous. I know ! Who can get married for 20 thou' ? My dress alone will cost 15 ! Continuing on. "The remainder of my estate which includeses the entirety of my financial holdings all real estate and its contents will go to the true love of my life the woman I was meant to be with" "My wife, Karen." Oh, my God ! Whoopee ! Kare, I was pulling for ya the whole time. You, me "And finally, to Lorraine Finster " What the hell's left ? His right teste on a biscuit ? "Lorraine, you always said you wanted nothing from me but affection. So I leave to you affection. Ta." I was trapped under that fatty for two days. I've got the word "Posturepedic" permanently imprinted in my spine and all I get is "ta" ? Well, I guess if you'd had ta-ta's you would've gotten everything.

                    			I still can't believe Stan's gone. And I must say, it was a beautiful funeral. It was, and it really got me thinking. We were the best looking ones there. I know. I mean, we were, like the reason it was beautiful. So, how about Stan leaving us all that money ? Twenty thousand dollars ! Yeah. To plan our wedding. I still have no idea why he thought we were a couple. - Is that your third glass of wine ? - Are you counting ? Sweetie, I am so excited about going to Guatemala with you. I'm a doctor without borders. Technically, you're not a doctor. Hey, I got a "B" in high school biology. Down there, I'm a doctor. Well, well, I've never seen trash take itself out. Stuff it, you bitter witch. Just getting the rest of my things before they start to reek of booze and anti-growth hormone. Well, then, you won't mind if I take a look in that suitcase. Up yours ! I may be a gold digger a stripper and a whore nine arrests no convictions. But I am no thief. I admire your principles. Almost as much as I admire my diamond ring in your hand. Give it up. And ? And ? Wow, impressive. Had we met years ago and under different circumstances this might have been hello instead of good-bye. I'll be leaving now. But I won't be leaving quickly. And why ? Because I have a diamond tiara up my bum. Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 24 sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ It was a lovely reception, Karen. I was especially moved by the Taco Bell fly-over. Well, thank you, Lars. You know, you kids can go if you want to. I've got a lot to do before the yacht leaves for St. Barts in the morning. Why are you going to St. Barts ? Oh, oh, visiting "friends" ? No, Stan wanted his ashes scattered in the Caribbean off the back of his yacht. It's going to feel very empty there without him. Of course, any place would feel empty without Stan. He took up a lot of room. Karen. We, uh, we could join you. Oh, I'd love it if you girls would come with me. Hey, did you know there's a jacuzzi onboard ? A jacuzzi ? I love bubbles ! Wow, fun ! There gonna be some spa-like things where we're going ? Well, the whole country's pretty much like a steam room. Oh, and Chef will be there with his famous morning crêpe station. - Crêpes ! - I love folded foods ! We'll have nice meals, right ? Depends if the food drop came that week. And the shopping. All of the stores on St. Barts are duty-free. Duty free ! Lotta doody. Gracie, honey why don't you come with ? I can't. I have to help people. You go have fun in your jacuzzi and your crêpes, and your shopping. I'll be fine sleeping in my own filth and waiting for food to drop down from the sky. Hey, sweetie. - Come on why don't you go ? - What ? Really ? Yeah, I mean I love you but let's face it. The thought of you doing something selfless is a joke. I love that you get me. Hey, guys we're going on a cruise ! Dr. Markus ? Uh, there's a Dr. Morty here to see you. Great. Tell Dani to come in. Oh, suddenly, I work for you too. Karen, I'm really sorry to do this here but this trip came about so fast they had to get my paperwork started so Dani offered to come and bring it by for me. Oh, good ! I finally get to meet the famous Dr. Morty. - Leo's going to Guatemala with him. - Her. Hi, I'm so sorry to intrude. Leo, your papers. Thank you. Dani, this is Will and Jack, Karen Rosario. Nice to meet you. This is my wife, Grace. Oh, Leo never mentioned he was married. Oh, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. He talks about you all the time ! All the women at the hospital they hate you. And one of the male nurses. Yeah, he mentioned you too. Although when he said "Dr. Morty," I pictured an old blotchy Jew who kept saying, "You call this dinner ?" You've met my father. I better get going. It was great meeting you. Hey, I'll walk you out. - Bye. - Bye, now. She seems nice. You must be dying ! Aren't you dying ? Your husband is going to Guatemala with that ! I would die ! I know ! That bod ! She could be in a Whitesnake video ! Just ! die ! That is some lucky flesh-eating virus that gets her. - Die ! Die ! Die ! - Okay ! I get it ! She's gorgeous and she saves lives. Big whoop. I look good sometimes. And I let people cut in front of me in line at the supermarket. Well, I haven't but I've thought of it. Come on, Gracie. You have nothing to worry about. I know that ! I'm very secure in my relationship. I love my husband and I know that he loves me. I would die ! I'm glad you all could be here. I spent a lot of time with Stanley on this boat. Not with him, I'd be with the crew on the opposite side to keep us from tipping. Here are the ashes. Wow ! Is that all Stan ? No, there's another can in the limo. They put him in a popcorn can ? Isn't that a little unseemly ? No more so than the cremation. It took four days and xused so much power that all of Bergen County lost their air conditioning. Mrs. Walker ? We're just about ready to shove off. Thanks, Driver. That's the captain ? That's your limo driver ! Yeah, drive a boat, drive a car, drive a plane. As long as I'm drunk what's the difference ? Well, I should probably get going. Our plane takes off in a couple of hours. - "Our" plane ? - Yeah, me and Dani. You're flying together ? Yeah, we're going to the same place. Why ? No, nothing. It's just that you never mentioned it. It's an interesting omission on your part. The way you omitted that it's interesting to me. - Are you okay ? - I'm good. I'm good. It'll be fun flying together. And lucky for you, if you have to make a water landing she has those huge flotation devices attached to her chest. Tell me, do they light up ? Hmm, it's cute when boring people fight. But come on, let's say we get out of here. I'll show you around. We'll start on the port side and work our way around to the whiskey side. She really was hot though, wasn't she ? I would die ! Grace, you're being silly. Danielle's a friend. I've known her for years. Besides, she's not even my type. Please, she's everyone's type. I'd do her. All right, l-l-let me just picture that for a minute. - Stop. Would you take this seriously ? - No ! Because nothing's gonna happen. Look, when we got married I took a vow for better, for worse. There were some other things in there I wasn't quite following because I could see your thong through your dress. I love you. You're right. You're right. I'm crazy. Go. Save the world heal the sick and just don't forget to get me a present. And a real present this time. Not one of those native crafts like you brought me from Africa. I want something that comes from a real store with a real receipt. How 'bout I just give you some cash when I get home ? That'll work too. Bye. What ? I see what you're up to. You planned this whole thing. What are you talking about ? This ! The boat, the sun, the lotion. Getting me to take my blouse off. It was all a clever ruse on your part to get with me. Well, you caught me, Jack. It was all part of my master plan. First, I arranged to have Stan die so I could have him cremated and thrown from this boat where I persuaded the sun to shine so I could lure you on deck and rub lotion on your creamy Hey, lovers, I hate to interrupt the honeymoon but we're just about to scatter Stan's ashes. And, Will, there are three things I want to tell you. One I really appreciate your being here. What are the other two ? Oh, when you sit like that I can see your man berries. What are you wearing ? Why aren't you dressed ? What ? We're on a boat. We're scattering the ashes of a dead man and you're dressed for Salma Hayek's pool party. I don't think Karen really cares what I'm wearing. It's the fact that I'm here that counts. Well, if everybody's ready we should get started. I wouldn't want Grace to be late to the MTV beach house. I didn't know ! How did everyone else know ? Because we know how to act in these situations. And because Will dressed me. Thank you all for being here today. This was one of Stan's favorite spots. He spent many an afternoon doing cannonballs off of the side of this boat. He destroyed an entire ecosystem and created that small chain of islands. I'd give anything to be with you again. One more dance, one more kiss. One more night in our box at the opera giggling at the frightened faces of the people sitting below us. But I guess that's never going to happen again. Listen, guys. I'm sorry. I think I need to do this by myself. Would that be okay ? Sure, Kare. We'll go open a bottle of champagne and drink a toast to Stan's memory. Grace, maybe you want to slip into a coconut bikini. Yeah, speaking of coconuts how 'bout a longer bathing suit ? I've been going like this all morning. You can go too, Ro-Ro. I'll be inside if you need me. I don't know what I'm gonna do without ya, Stanley. I don't know what I'm gonna do without him, either. Wh ? How the hell did you get here Dame Judi Wench ? I made a deal with your driver. He promised to let me stowaway in his cabin if I'd let him stowaway in my capri pants. Good Lord. How many men are we going to share ? Get the hell outta here ! Look, I just came here to say one last good-bye to Stanley. And to give him this. Oh, my God. It's, it's Stanley's favorite toupee. I knew he couldn't rest in peace without his piece. His mother gave him this for his sweet 16. Thank you. I know that he would have wanted to have this. Perhaps in the next world they can convince him to wash it. Oh, God, I'm gonna miss him. Me too. - Would you like to - No, that's okay. You do it. You get some air under that thing it really moves. Ah, the sea life. Isn't it romantic ? I wish we both had dates. Or if only one of us could have a date I wish it was me. What's the matter Grace ? You okay ? I was just thinking about what a shmuck I was. Leo's not gonna cheat on me. I mean, look at me. I'm a freakin' bombshell. Yes, I believe it was Rita Hayworth who said "a woman is only as beautiful as the amount of food she keeps in her teeth." I am a bombshell. I'm gonna go visit the poop deck if you know what I mean. This place is dead. What should we do ? I believe there's a new gay bar that just opened up right over there. Let's go. I like holding your hand. It's almost as soft as Stanley's. You know, for a scheming, husband-stealing skanky whore, you're good people. Listen, I know you've kind of fallen on hard times since Stanley left you nothing in his will. Is there anything I can do for ya ? Well, you can start by giving me some of that bloody money. I'm not kidding. - Forget it ! - Why not ? Well for starters, I don't know how you'd even begin to divvy up something like $985 million dollars. Listen, you drunken sea hag. I spent the better part of a year with that man Tell him what his feet look like. Tell him what his knees look like. I deserve something. You deserve something. Well, how about I let you keep screwing my driver ? Oh, and do me a favor, don't kill him. We need to get home. Ooh, oh ! I love this song ! Mornin', Driver. Ma'am, I think your husband left his bag. Oh, this is Leo's. Thank you, Driver. Shoot. Hope there's nothing in here that he needs. "To Leo" ? This looks private. Leo, we're going to be spending a lot of time together in the next few weeks and I have to say something in this letter. I could never say to you in person. I want you. OhmyGod. You have to know that you can have me whenever, wherever. And when that time comes know that I am going to Until you beg me to stop. I can't wait. Love, Danielle. That bitch. Driver, hang a right !

                    			Get out of my bed! You get out of my bed! That's your bed! This is my bed! If this was your bed, it would already be made. If this was your bed, it would be shaped like a race car, and you'd be clutching your woowie. Now scram, I'm naked over here! Wait a minute I'm naked too! Guys! You would not believe what I just found in Leo's bag a love letter from that bitch, Dr. Morty. When I think of how I almost didn't read it because I was respecting his privacy, it makes me so glad I'm never honest! Come on, I need to talk it out. Uh, ah, we'll-- We'll join you in a sex-- Suck--! Sex--! Two minutes! Yeah, and then you can tell us all the nudes-- Dudes--! Man-on-man action! Hello hurry up. I'm freakin' out here. Oh, my God! You two Have a little CD player? No fair! I hate this boat. Well, this is just great. When we get to St. Barts, I am buying myself an E-P-T. And so help me, if that stick is blue.. I am not going through this alone. Not again. Let's just figure this out, okay? Now what What did we do last night? We--we--we-- we drank a lot, we danced, we peed off the side of the boat. But at some point, I came down here to crash. That much I remember. And--and I remember waking up and realizing we were in bed naked with each other. Rightbecause that happened 30 seconds ago! Look, if something happened, you would've remembered, because it's so rare for you. Right. And if something had happened, you would've left and my wallet would be missing. So nothing happened. nothing happened. Nothing happened. It's funny I tell ya I guess we should get dressed. Wait a minute, my wallet is missing. Will & Grace episode 06x01 "Dames At Sea" synchro:Marksbeb Do you believe her? I mean, who does that? Who sends a love letter to a married man? I mean, it's one thing if it's your roommate's dad that looks like Mark Spitz  and drives a Datsun 280ZX, and you're pretty sure he winked when he said he had an office in the city. As random example. "Leo, we're going to be spending a lot of time together." Blah, blah, blah, blah. "Something I could never say to you. I want you." Wow. "You can have me wherever, whenever." That's hot. Yeah. Do you believe her? I just wish I knew some voodoo so I could cast a spell on her and turn her into a ferret. Yeah, that's pretty much your only option. Okay, then we've got to go down to Guatemala and stop her before she does something. Grace, you are way over-reacting to this. He's right. Besides, you should've seen this coming, Grace. What's that supposed to mean? Well, it's karma, dear. Yeah. It's what you get for marrying above your station. See, by marrying Leo, who-- if I may compare both of you to cuts of meat-- is a Grade "A" slab of prime rib, while you-- you're just a plain-looking girl. You have spat in God's eye and now must be punish-ed. Ooh, stress wrinkle, right there in the-- Grace! Please, let me just beat him until he bleeds! Calm down, Grace! What are you going to do? You gonna fly to Guatemala, track him down, make some big scene like some crazy Guatemalan scene maker? -you're--you're-- you're keyed up over nothing. It's just a letter. Yeah. Yeah, it's just a letter. He's not gonna respond to that. I, myself, have written him several letters all unspeakably filthy. And I didn't get nothing but a wink and a smile. -So he's not gonna? -No. -And she's not gonna? -No. -And they're not gonna? -No. Thanks, Will, it's so good to talk it out. Wait, what's that? It sounds like another boat. Hold on, Rosie, we're almost there! Oh, my God, what happened to you guys? Lorraine tried to kill me! She threw me overboard. Rosie jumped in after. And then this Russian freighter came by, pulled us out. We spent the night. It was horrible. This morning, we swiped their jet ski. That's Russian for jet ski. Aw, Karen, that's awful. Could you point out the coordinates on this map? You know, out there in that icy water I stared death in the face. And let me tell you, it wasn't pretty. Ah! There it is again! Yuk yuk yuk. I saved your miserable life out there. Honey, I'm sorry. You're right. If you hadn't turned your support hose into a life vest and used your bra as a sail I might not still be here. That's right. So don't forget your promise. Promise? I don't remember any promise. You're not weaseling out of this, sister. You promised me one Friday off a month. Talk to the boob! Karen, the woman saved your lifeinexplicably. She's asking for so little stupidly. Oh, all right. But I don't want the rest of the staff finding out about this. So you tell them you're getting monthly hormone treatments to turn into a man. Or a woman, whichever is more believable. this whole thing has just been so exhausting I buried my husband, almost died, learned to dance the ksiazka. Would you kids mind if we just headed back to New York? Of course not. Guys, do you mind missing St. Barts? I can't speak for Jack, but, you know, I don't mind kissing him-- Kissing it-- Missing it! Yeah, I wouldn't mind getting home to dry hump-- dry land-- hump Will! Wait a minute. If Lorraine threw you overboard, doesn't that mean she's still here? My God, you're right. That Brit's still on this boat. Come on, let's put a little Colgate on a toothbrush and see if we can scare her out of her cabin. What's that? It's Lorraine! She's taking your jet ski! Speak English. It's Lorraine! She's taking your jet ski! Will, you're my lawyer, do something. You!! I'm really more of a litigator. Guess what? Leo's coming home! Why? What happened? His passport and all his papers were in the bag he left on the boat. He spent four days in a tiny holding room at the Guatemala City airport with two missionaries and two people in the missionary position. Dr. Morty never got a chance to make her moves on. Thank God. I was a little worried. You said I had nothing to worry about. Leo's coming home! Yay! Okay, now what do I do with the letter? Throw it out. I could. But then he'll never know the truth about her. So show it to him. But then he'll know I snooped. No, he's got to find this on his own. And I've got to be there when he reads it so I can act all shocked about it. Ooh, I know what I'll do. I'll do this. No, too big. Maybe Maybe just one. Grace, do you work? Or do you just spend the day practicing your reactions? Thought so. - Oh, I was just putting out the garbage and I got so much to do so - Oh, you know, things are crazy right now with the holidays What was that weirdness just now? What weirdness? Didn't notice. Must've happened after I left. Give it up. Okay. Look. Is this from the Betty Rubble collection? Will. Remember when--on the boat when you came into the room, and--and--and Jack and I were in bed Right. Without any clothes on after a night of drinking - Oh, my God!! - And we're gay don't freak out. Nothing happened I think. What do you mean, you think? - I don't remember. - Oh! Oh, right! It's not funny. You and Jack finding love. Becoming lovers. Were there kisses? - Were there butterfly kisses? - Oh, stop it. This isn't funny. Jack-- I-- I think Jack may have feelings for me. Of course he does. He's always had a thing for you. And now you tossed him a bone. Or he tossed you a bone. I wasn't there, I don't know what happened. But I do think you're gonna have to let him down easy. How do you do that? You know, how do ya-- How do ya tell someone that you have kind of a history with that you're just not interested in them romantically? I guess I could start with a plate of soft cheeses Oh, my God! You and Will? God, why don't you tell the whole restaurant? Don't make a big deal about it. Nothing even happened I think. You think? Honey, either you know or you don't. Unless you're lucky enough to be married to a man like my late husband who always let me sleep through it. Hey there, big guy in the sky. Here's a little somethin' for ya. I can't believe I was in bed with Will. When I woke up and saw that olive skin and that furry body, I thought, "Please, God, let it be a giant furry olive." But you know the worst part, Karen? you're both men? No. I think Will has feelings for me. Well, of course he has feelings for you, honey. I mean, look at his love life. The only man he's had in the last 16 years is Grace. You're right. That poor, unlucky, pear-shaped bastard. What should I do, Kare, what should I do? Well, honey, you gotta end it. I mean, if you let it go -- Wait, are refills free? - Not on cappuccinos. I could put coffee in it. -  Thanks. -Great - If you let it go on any longer, he'll just get more and more obsessed. I mean, next thing you know, he's moving in next door, and-- - He already has! - You're right, Kare. I gotta end it. And I gotta end it now. - No, no, honey. Not now. -Why? -Coffee. what's the emergency? It's Friday-- my day off, remember? I'm on my way to a taping of "Whoopi." I know, Rosie, but I really do need you. I've decided to start collecting those wooden nesting dolls. Go around town and see what you can pick up. Yeah, I like the way they start out big and then get little teeny-tiny. Go. Forget it. I saved your miserable gin-soaked life. Maybe you didn't hear me. I said I like the way they get little teeny-tiny. Go. Oh, hey, Rosie. Table for one? I'm not staying. But I will have a biscotti. I hear those tapings can go on for hours. Oh, my god, she's choking! Well, well, well. The hunter has become the Mexican. aren, save her. This restaurant cannot weather another tragedy! Oh, I'll save her Just as long as she goes back to working every Friday. I-N-S! There. We're even. I'll start looking for those dolls. You--you know, I'm going to have to charge you for that biscotti. Sweetie, you're home. Come on. Unpack your bag. Make sure your passport's there, along with your other stuff-- underwear, letters, whatever. Later, later. I--I had a bumpy landing. It kinda, you know, got me in the mood. Oh. Oh, oh, okay. - Well, you know what gets me in the mood? - What's that? Knowing that my man has proper international travel documentation. Okay, okay, I'll--I'll--I'll-- I'll look. - What's this? - Hmm, looks like a letter. - It's a letter. - That's what I thought too. - It's from Dr. Morty. - Dr. Morty? Why is, uh, why is she writing me? Hello. Oh, man. Man--whew, man. Yeah, it's my itinerary. It is not! Is it?! I don't know! Grace, you, uh, you--you obviously read it. And thank God! She wants you, Leo. But I don't-- I don't want her. Please. You're two hot people down in the sunny tropics with nothing else to do but have sex. I know. I've been to Daytona twice. Grace, Doctors Without Borders is there to prevent an entire population from being annihilated by infectious diseases. Yeah, for, like, 20 minutes a day. Then it's "doctors without bottoms." Sweetie, she's nothing to me. And by the way, in-in-in the future, if you're gonna go through my things, just try to be a little bit more thorough. - These are all pictures of me. - Yeah. My eyes are closed in all of them. That's because you're asleep I-I-I took them before I left, because I can't sleep unless you're asleep next to me. That is so sweet. And so creepy. - So are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. You know, all I could think about since I left was one of your home cooked meals. So let's go upstairs and have sex. - Then we'll spend all day tomorrow in bed. - Oh, oh, baby, baby, I can't. I have an early flight. - You're leaving? No, you just got here. - I know, but they're expecting me back. Look, I-- I'm gonna go jump in the shower. You put on the panties I got you for Passover, and I'll meet you in the bedroom. Hi. I need to talk to you just for a second. Good, 'cause I-I-I need to talk to you too. - So-- - Yeah. I, um, I discovered a new cheese over the weekend. Cowgirl Creamery. You want to try some? I would. - This Cowgirl Creamery is a very good cheese. - Thank you. That's a nice top. Thanks. Just got it. - I'm not interested in you. - I'm not interested in you. - No, I'm not interested in you. - No, I'm not interested in you. - No, I'm not interested in you! - No, I'm not interested in you! What are you doing?! I'm letting you down easy! Nuh-uh! If anyone's letting anyone down easy, I'm letting down you. And yet you're wooing me with soft cheeses and compliments to the top. Jack, come on. This clearly meant more to you than it did to me because, well, look at me. I am, and I'm looking at a forehead with teeth. ack, you have feelings for me. How else do you explain constantly offering to spot me at the gym? - That's what you do at the gym. - In the sauna? Look, if anyone has feelings for anyone, it's you for me. Signing us up for a tango class. Signing us up for a cooking class. Everyone knows you express your love through the dance and the bake. - Let's just forget about who has more of a thing for whom. - You for me. - I said forget it! Whatever happened on that boat wouldn't have happened unless there was something lurking in our relationship for a long time. Something we--we need to start dealing with honestly. So is that what we're doing now? We're just being honest? I think we have to if there's any hope of getting past this. Well, if we're being honest, I guess I'd be lying if I said I never And I'd by lying if I said I never Wilma, take off your homo hat and put on your lawyer hat. That damn Rosario saved my life again! You know how I'm in a gang, right? Well, I flashed my colors in the wrong neighborhood and suddenly I'm surrounded. I'm about to take a cap to TYE dome when Rosie screeches up in the limo, pulls me in and guns it. Now she wants her day off and a pizza party with the maids. So, get me out of it. Oh, by the way, every room in the boat is under video surveillance. I took a look at the tape and nothing happened between you guys, just the occasional gas and some soft weeping. Whew, there's a lot of caffeine in a Red Bull! See ya! - So Nothing happened. - Nothing happened. - Nothing happened. - Nothing happened! R-O-L-A-I-D-S. Us. I know, you're gross. And you're a pasty-faced, middle-aged woman. - I'm glad we're back to this. - Uh, me too. Hey, want to go see a movie later? Maybe a documentary that raises more questions than it does answers. Okay, I like that. - Oh, thank god that weirdness is over. - Oh, thank god. Leo, come on. You're gonna miss your plane. I can't find my bucky pillow. - That's so cute. You named your pillow? - No, it's a bucky pillow. It's for the plane. It goes around your neck like this. Oh, is that what that's for? 'Cause, you know, it also goes around the toilet seat like that. Want me to get it? Let's just hope that that's the last thing my neck and your ass have to share. - I'm gonna miss you. - I'm gonna miss you too. Oh, I almost forgot. I wrote you a letter. - But don't read it. You have to wait until you go to bed tonight. - Of course. No, no, no. I'm--I'm serious. This is really important to me. I want this to be the last thing you see before you fall asleep. Okay, the first time I agreed, I was lying. But now that I know it's really important, I'm really gonna do it. Okay. Now come here. Put some of that stank on me. - Call me the second you get there. - I will. - Bye. - Be safe. Okay. Who am I kidding? "Dear Grace, I can't believe I'm saying good-bye to you again. Last night, I was watching you sleep. And, well, it just made me realize it's so much better than sleeping next to a picture. If you're reading this, you're probably in your nightgown ready to crawl into bed or it's been 30 seconds and you're in the same outfit because you can't follow a simple instruction. Either way, I'm not leaving. I'm giving up Doctors Without Borders. I'm on the other side of the door." What? I'm on the other side of the door. Oh, my God. Are you sure? I don't want you to do this for me. I'm--i'm doing it for us. Why did you do the whole letter thing? Why didn't you just tell me in person? Well, 'cause-- 'cause you tend to, uh, to hit when you get excited. No, I don't. I can't believe you're staying! So what are you sayin', counselor? There's nothin' I can do? I'm sorry. You and Rosario have a verbal agreement, and you have to live up to it. But I just saved her life. Holding a toaster over the bathtub and not dropping it is not saving her life. Oh, all right. She can have her damn day off and her pizza party. But no sleepovers. And no correspondence with her family!   
                




                    			Hi, guys. Hi, Grace. I like your new crew cut. Over here. Oh. Hi, guys. Hi, Grace. I like your new crew cut. - Two lattés, please. Thank you. - Oh, waiter, could get me a slice of raw beef and some water? You still on the Zone diet? It's tough. I stopped after the snacks tried to break out of their containers. No, silly. It's for my dog. Oh, my God, I love dogs. Let me see the little gerbil? No, this is Chompers, the Earl of Puppydom. He belonged to Lorraine. We found him in the back of Stan's closet living off of little bits of turkey he found in Stan's trouser cuffs. I'd keep him, but every time I see him, he makes me think of Lorraine. She used to sit on the couch at gnaw at her ass too. Anyway, I'm glad you're all here. Tomorrow night, I have something very special planned for all of us. Yay. - Leo and I are having a dinner party. - Boo. - Leo's ex-girlfriend is coming. - Yay. - But I'm fine with it. So there's no drama. - Boo. Really? His ex is coming? - Ya-- - Stop it! Yeah, Leo said that he ran into her in the subway. And being the cool wife that I am, I said, "Invite her over. It'll be fun." You're hoping she has big ears and buckteeth, right? Little bit. You know, I was kinda worried you'd be jealous of Diane. I mean, she's cute, she's smart, she's an editor at Vogue. Her piece on eyebrow shaping won the coveted Shallow Award. Big whoop. So you had a fling before me. I had hundreds. It was like a a revolving door, loser after loser after loser after Wait. Ah, shoot. You know, we only have five wine glasses? I'll just wash out one of the glasses we use to keep our toothbrushes in. Hi. You must be Diane. I'm Grace. Hi. Uh-oh. Awkward moment. New wife meets the ex-girlfriend. You think he traded down, I think he traded up. You're a gorgeous redhead, I'm an adorable blonde. But we know we have something in common brown hair. Come on in. Hey, is that Diane? - Hey, Leo. - Hey, hey, hey. How you doin'? I'm good. Wow. A room full of Leo lovin' ladies. I'd give anything to take that back. Well, you did good, Leo. Man, she's pretty. I hope you don't mind me judging you solely on the basis of your looks. Oh, please, how else would you judge someone? Hey, I brought you something. Oh, my God. That is fantastic. Is it? It was in a basket in front of your neighbor's door. Maybe I should keep it. - No. You've got the Hermès Birkin bag. I love that bag! - Oh, I love it too. Well, lookie-loo. Same taste in bags same taste in dudes. I promise, I'll stop. I've been on a waiting list for that bag for two years, you bitch. I can say that, right? We're in that place? Oh, we're way past that place, you dirty skank. You know what? Here. Take it. What? No. No, I couldn't. Oh, please. Writing for Vogue, they give you tons of swag. Besides, I want you to like me. Dia--It's okay, Diane. She likes you already. No, it helps. All right, so I'll be right back. I gotta fix all this. Um, I kinda thought you were gonna be butt-ugly. Leo. - She's nice, huh? - Nice? She's fantastic. You traded down. Wait. You know, I am so proud of you. I mean, I thought meeting my ex was gonna be much harder for you. Why? What'd you think I'd do? Fall back, clutch myself, gasping? "Oh, my God." Don't flatter yourself. Well, how can I not? I mean, at the moment, I've had sex with everyone in this apartment. Including myself. Hi, lovers. Hi, Grace. Hi, Lebron. Is she here? Is she pretty? Is she prettier than you? Is she prettier than me? She's great. Really. She gave me a purse. Look. The Hermès Birkin bag! I've been--I've been on that waiting list for two years. For my mother. Honey, we got you a dog. - A dog? - Yeah. I've always wanted a dog. And I still do. This looks like something a dog coughed up. No thanks. Hey, this is Chompers. The Earl of Puppydom. On cold nights, he keeps your privates warm I've heard. Hi, everybody. Oh, everybody, this is Diane. This is Jack and Karen. - And this is - Will ? Diane? How do you guys know each other? - We once, um-- - Hey, I know who you are! This is the only girl Will has ever had sex with. Oh My God! - Oh, my God? - Oh My God! I forgot to salt the tomatoes. And they are certainly not going to salt themselves! No! What's going on? Nothing. I'm salting tomatoes. Yeah? 'Cause it looks like you're assaulting them. Why did you invite her here? She's ruining everything. What, 'cause she slept with Will? What, are you jealous of them? I'm not jealous. And I'll tell you why I'm jealous. Because I'm not jealous. - You're not making any sense. - Oh, and all of the sudden, you're the President of "Things That Make Sense"? I'm so sorry didn't call you back the next day or-- ever again. Yeah. Well, I-I-I was a little surprised when I woke up and you were gone. But I did appreciate that you baked cookies and did a load of whites. My way of apologizing. I just--I just felt so weird about the whole thing because I was-- I--I was gay, you know. I still am. Yeah. Like I didn't know that. How did you know? Probably 'cause you put your rubber on with your pinky up, Mary. That and that you were kind, sweet, sensitive, wanted to cuddle a lot. Don't straight guys like to cuddle? Not in an attempt to delay intercourse. But, you know, the dead giveaway was that you cried the whole time we were doing it. Don't straight guys like to cry? Di, if I may get a little personal on your ass. What magical twist of fate brought you two kids together? Well, I was blind drunk, and my roommate was under observation for pulling all of her hair out. Beautiful. Beautiful. We'll be right back. We're talking with one-night stand Diane. I like you. Wanna make out? I like you too. Let's see how the evening goes. So You and Will, huh? Yep, me and Will And, uh, me and you, huh? Yeah. Me and you. And maybe later, me and Karen. So in a way, you and Will have slept together. So technically, you're bi. We'll be right back. We're talkin' with swings-both-ways Leo. You know if you chop that any finer, the guests are going to have to snort it. Why don't you tell Diane? I'm sure she'll find it hi-i-i-ilarious. Are you mad at me? No. I'm not mad. And I'll tell you why I'm mad. Because I'm not mad. - You're not making any sense. - Oh! And all of the sudden, you're the Vice President of "Things That Make Sense"? - Why vice president? - Because Leo's president. Deal with it. - What is wrong with you? - Oh, I don't know. Maybe I'd feel better if I slept with Diane. That seems to be the cure for everything. Dinner! Come on, Chompers. Pee pee, poo poo. Do your dirty for daddy. What are you doing? Well, you told us to take him for a walk. Not around my dining room. Fine. We'll take him out. Well, Grace, everything smells delicious. Whoops! You almost made it, Chompers. It's as big as he is! Well, maybe not everything. - Did he just--? - Don't worry Grace, I put a salad bowl over it. Can we open the $25 bottle of wine I brought? 'Cause I think we're done with the $6 stuff. It's-- it's my fault. I thought two bottles per person was going to be enough. Maybe if we were in high school. I'm the same way. I always keep track of whatever I bring to a party. If I had a dollar for every piece of Tupperware I never got back I'd have $13. Big surprise. You agree with her, but you don't agree with me. - You didn't say anything for me to agree with. - You didn't give me a chance to say anything, did you? Mmm. Grace, this is delicious. It's so nice to be around people who eat food. When somebody has a birthday at Vogue, they put a candle in the middle of a Lifesaver and then argue about who gets the smallest piece. - I made these kabobs for Grace once. She totally fell in love with the recipe. - Liar! How could I fall in love with your kabobs? I've never had them. Diane had your kabobs. But apparently, I wasn't good enough for your kabobs. Wait. Why do you care that Diane's had Will's kabobs, but you don't care that she's had mine and I've had hers? Silly. Diane is a girl. She doesn't have kabobs. She has a kagina. And nice katits. You know, Grace, I was with Diane a year and a half. It wasn't just one drunken night in a dorm room. It was a lot of drunken nights. Including one embarrassing incident involving a public bathroom and an untimely entrance by Ed Koch. By the way, I know it seems like I need to drink in order to have sex. I don't, it just makes it better. Nobody finds you interesting. Except your husband and your best friend? Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, you know, it's--it's a--it's a party. Let's let lose a-a-and eat frosting right out of the can. Will's right. Now come on, come on. Change the subject. For gosh sakes. So, Diane, you work for Vogue, huh? Who was a better lay, Huck Finn or Captain Homo? Come on! Who was better? Who was better? No. We are not discussing this. It's not a competition. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. - Will was better. - Yes! What do you mean "Will was better"? He couldn't find a G-spot with Yahoo! Maps. Yahoooooooooo-hoo! Leo, don't let it bug you. I'm sure there's plenty of things you're better at. They just don't involve sex with a woman. You know, I don't have to defend myself here. Grace can tell you how good I am. Two words: Disneyland. Jail. Well, you know, I'd love to help you out, sweetie. But I really don't have any basis for comparison. You see, I've had you, but I've never had, uh, this guy. Because apparently, I wasn't good enough. Are you ever gonna let this go? No. I don't understand. When I found out that you slept with someone right after you couldn't do it with me, I always thought that--that--that the woman would be totally different than me. You know, ugly. And then this walked in. Hi. She is beautiful. She's funny. She's smart. She's like my twin. Yeah. Right honey. Just like Randy Quaid is Dennis Quaid's twin. So what was it, Will? Why her and not me? Excuse me! I had an actual relationship with this woman. I mean, she had a drawer at my apartment. I-I called her parents Papa Tom and Mama Joanne. You know, I-I-I-- We had our pictures taken on a coffee mug together wearing T-shirts saying "Caution: We're hot." So how about a little jealousy for me? You know what, you're right. I'm sorry. I've been such an idiot. And if I just really stopped and thought, and I just focused on what was real, it--it does kill me that you were with such an amazing woman for so long. Thank you. That's all I needed. You're welcome. So what was it, Will? Why her, not me? I'm going to get the coffee mug. I told you this. Because I cared about you and I didn't care about her. You'd just thrown me out of your house. So I-I went to this party, loaded up on vodka and Squirt, met her, and had what was apparently phenomenal sex. The next morning, I-I-I ran to Jack's house and spent the whole day crying and talking about you. - Really? - He did. He was a wreck. He was crying so hard, he could barely iron his jeans. The thing with her was a drunken, meananingless night that I only look back on with shame. It meant nothing to me. Really? Well, it meant something to me! - Huh? - I remember everything about that night. How we met at-- at Jenny von Slaniker's "Back From Mono" party. You were in the kitchen for some reason running the bong through the dishwasher. I was immediately drawn to you because you were cleaner than everybody else. then we--we danced to that Dead or Alive song, "You Spin Me 'Round." And you did, Will. You spun me right 'round, baby. Right 'round, like a record, baby! Right 'round, 'round, 'round! The girl's a mess. Well, so's your Birkin bag, honey. Bad boy, Chompers. Later when-- wh-- when we made love on my futon, it was so romantic. My hair was burning on my hotplate, but I didn't care. How could that be? I mean, I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I was scared. I was fumbling. I don't even think I took my underwear off. All I know is it's the only time I've ever had an orgasm. Ever. In my life. What?! Well, I-I-I was close that time, but Ed Koch wrecked it. Isn't it important to you at all? I mean, didn't-didn't-didn't you take anything away from it? I-I took one of your Benetton sweaters. That was my roommate's sweater. She accused me of stealing it. We went to student court! I'm sorry. I didn't-- Like I told you, I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I was a basket case. I still am a basket case! Excuse me. Oh-ho-ho, yeah. This is just where I was hoping this evening was going. You know, uh, maybe I should check to see if she has an emotionally disturbed brother with the same legs. Well maybe it's just as well you never did take a ride on the Truman train. That coulda ruined you for life. Train? You had one passenger. Yes, but at least she got off. Yeah, at crazy town! - I'm gonna go check on her too. - No, no, no, no. You are mine. And you're not going anywhere near that woman ever again. Now that's what I'm talkin' about.   
                




                    			What is it about putting metal to cotton that makes me feel like a man? - Hey. - Hey. Leo, be honest with me How do you feel when you see a pillowcase this perfect? I feel excited, and then sad. Wait, scratch "excited." - So, do you have that tennis racket for me? - Yeah. Right here. Never been used. Bought it a few years ago when I was still hoping that Lleyton Hewitt was a latent homosexual. I can't believe you guys are playing tennis today. It's a beautiful sunny day, you should be at the movies. I know. I'd love to be inside, but Karen invited me to her country club. Yeah, I'm surprised Karen belongs to a club that lets Jews in. Oh, actually, I might have to sign in as Kelly O'Reilly. Anyway, what are you doing today? I'm gonna drive to Connecticut, see my mom. Since the divorce became final, she, you know, sounds a little down. I'm gonna spend some time with her. Which show did you buy tickets to as an excuse to get out of there? Hey, I don't need an excuse. The fact that I have seats for Mamma Mia with a strict 8:00 pm curtain time is purely coincidental. Wait, so, so you get a little Mama, and then you get a little Mamma Mia? Come on, give me another one. I'm on fire. Anyway, I'm taking Jack along for company. And 'cause it's fun when my mother yells at him for touching the furniture. He cried once. Oh, it was so good. Thanks for this. You guys kiss way too much. Sorry, guys, can't talk, a lot going on right now, really. Are my khakis done? You know what they say, a wrinkled ass is the devil's playground. Beat that, Hung Lee Dry Cleaners. You really love ironing, don't you? I do love ironing. Okay I might be a little rusty. The last time I played was at Camp Hasamir Hatzayir. I won the singles title, and got to try ham. Yeah. Honey, feel free to keep the Jew talk down to a whisper. Hey, guys. Man, this is a fancy club. I can't tell whether I was peeing in a urinal or an empty candy dish. Grace's husband, what are you doing here? Well, he was gonna play with us. That's okay, right? Oh, heh, well I thought it was just gonna be you and me. - Is there a problem? - No. I thought it was just gonna be you and me. Oh, I'm sorry. I just assumed when you invited me that you invited me and my husband. No, it's fine. I don't know how to tell you this, but I thought it was just gonna be you and me. Besides, where am I gonna find a partner at the last minute? Well, well, well. Karen Walker Once again single in a doubles world. Beverley Leslie with your pants so tight, won't you be my partner tonight? Ooh, I would be honored. - You think we can take 'em? - Please between the two of us, we've got eight feet on them. Okay. Just a quick stop here, and then back to New York for two hours of Mamma Mia, and a lifetime of trying to get "Dancing Queen" out of our heads. I'm so excited. Do you realize we haven't seen it in almost three weeks? Okay, I went once without you. I went twice yesterday. Hello, anybody home? Hi Will. Hi Didn't you hear me calling you? Yeah, I did, but Oh, I figured that if I didn't answer, eventually, you'd find me sitting here alone, so, I didn't want to waste the energy saying, "Hi, 'I'm in here." Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Hello, Jack. - Hi, Mrs. Truman, I just wanted to say-- - Ooh, don't touch that molding. There is some kind of, ugh, oil on your hands that, last time, actually damaged the wood. Isn't it a little dark in here, mom? Come on, you should open the curtains. It's a beautiful day. Oh, is it? Oh, last time I looked, it was pouring rain. Boy, time flies when the man you've been devoted to for 40 years says, "Stop calling, you're waking us up." Now, who wants a glass of chardonnay? Mom! You don't drink chardonnay in the dining room at 10:00 in the morning. You pour it into a coffee cup and drink it in the bathroom. - What's going on? - Oh, nothing's going on. It's just that the things that seem so important just don't seem so important anymore, you know Impressing the neighbors, keeping up appearances bathing. Well, for what it's worth, I can barely smell ya. - You're sweet, Jack. - Well, I bathe. Oh, don't sit there! That chair's for guests. Mom, I'm worried about you. You're sitting here alone in the dark. You-your ornamental gourds are all askew. And-- And are you not wearing a bra? Oh, I have it on. It's just around my waist. I'm hungry. I'm gonna go get the rest of that sandwich out of my bed. Okay, she seems fine. Fine? It's like a scene from Grey Gardens in here. I'm afraid if we leave, she's gonna take a nap at the bottom of the pool. Hey, my grandmother wears her bra around her waist. Of course, that's where her boobs are. Come on, serve! What, you need a normal-sized person to stand on so you can see over the net? I'll have you know, people at the club actually talk about my serve! They also talk about your he/she quality, but that's not gonna win us the points. Come on! That's a good sound. If we can still have children, that was really funny. Oh, are you okay? I'm fine, fine. Must have been her drinking arm. Ooh, I'm sorry, Grace's husband. I promise it won't happen again. Nice shot We win! Take that, you stupid giants! - Karen, can I see you for a minute? - Sure, honey. Sweetie, can I get you anything? Uh, maybe just a glass of water. And-and some tiny crutches for my balls. What the hell's the matter with you?! Why are you harpooning my husband? "Husband, husband." Does everything have to be about your precious "husband"? Ok, I get it. You just lost Stan, and then I show up with my guy. This must be incredibly hard for you. No, that's not it. No. Then what is it? Karen? Well, you told me about the hit and run, you can tell me. It's just I hate Leo. Yeah. Yeah. Boop. - What? - Mm-hmm, hate him. Hate him, hate him, hate him. He's dull, he's ugly, and he don't make me laugh. - Is that all? - Wellno, honey, but I don't want to say anything more, that would be hurtful. - Hey, mom, you know what we should do? - Your father was selfish in bed. That's right, the vacuum game! Oh, I love the vacuum game. But do they make attachments for girls? Not that vacuum game. And by the way, you can keep my Dust Buster. Come on, mom! - Oh, I can't even remember the rules. - Of course, you do. I-I-I vacuum a room, and then you follow me around and critique it. And every time I did it right, I'd get a fudge brownie. Every question I've ever had about you has just been answered. I think the vacuum may have broken when I used it to suck up your father's Rolex. Great. What are we gonna do? She's still a mess! And if we stay here any longer, we're gonna be late for Mamma Mia. And you know if you miss the first five minutes, you may as well miss the whole thing! Hey, calm down, veins-a-poppin'. I have an idea. Why don't we bring her with us? No! My mother hates musical theater. I took her to see Les Mis. She said, "Oh, please dear, in real life, the poor people never sing that much." - Trust me, she'd hate Mamma Mia. - Mamma Mia? Are you boys going to see that? You know, the woman next door whose son has a meth problem raved about it. Really? You want to go? You-you do know there will be singing? Oh, I love singing. Oh wait, they aren't poor, are they? How could you not like Leo? Everyone likes him. Even the woman whose leg he amputated said, "I may have lost a leg, but I gained a friend." Honey, I told you, he just doesn't make me laugh. Although, I believe I said it like this. He don't make me laugh. Well, obviously, you have no sense of humor because he's funny. He's like Regis funny. And if you don't see that, well, then I feel sorry for you. - Knock, knock. - Oh, hey, what do you know about that? A knock-knock joke, and Leo's famous for them. Ha, ha, ha! Who's there? You see, I wasn't saying a knock-knock joke, I just entered without knocking, so I said, "knock knock." You kill me. Baby, um will you tell Karen what you did the other day at Balducci's in-in-in the produce aisle? - That was good. - I know. - That was good. - It was, tell it. - Okay. - And tell it really funny. Tell it perfect. Uh, I decided to make chicken the other night, so, so I was gonna marinate some carrots. Sweetie, cut to the funny part. That's not the funny part. So I'm standing behind this woman who's also buying carrots. And right before we had a chance to reach for them, she grabs the last bag. So I said to her, look, could you maybe make an 18-carrot meal instead of a 24-carrot meal? Get it? "Carrot." Like gold? Yeah. I got that. Listen, I'm gonna go "poop." You could've told that a lot better! You should have said carrots more, it's a funny word. Fool! What-what is wrong with you? I'm sorry. It's just it's Karen. Okay, Karen doesn't really like you. Well, so what? I don't really like her. Come on, let's go grab some lunch. - Well, doesn't that bother you? - No. Not everybody has to like me. Yes, they do. If people don't like you, how are you supposed to know if you like yourself? Well, you still like me, don't you? I don't know. It's all muddy now. Why can't she see how fantastic you are? Wait a minute. You're concerned about the opinion of a woman whose pet peeves are sobriety and kindness? You're right. Who cares what that lunatic thinks. Everyone else adores you and that's all that matters. - What about you, Grace? - I'll get there. Mamma Mia, here I go again. My, my, how can I resist ya? Mamma Mia, does it show again? My, my, just how much I missed ya. Whoa! Boy I can't remember the last time I had so much fun. Oh yes, that's right, it was right before I walked in on your father holding that hooker up in the air with his legs. There was something in the air that night, the moon was bright. Fernando Jack, thank you. It was a great idea. I really owe you one. Well, I don't know why you're so surprised. For I am a wise man, Will. A wise man. Yes, you are. By the way, that's potpourri. Or is it brain food for a wise man? It's potpourri. Come on, mom, say goodnight to Jack. I'll drive you home. Home? Ugh. The thought of going back to that house makes me want to stop taking my calcium pills, and throw myself down the stairs. Come on, we're gonna see each other in a couple of weeks. In the meantime, think of all the fun you're gonna have with your "Mamma Mia" beach towel, and your "Waterloo" water bottle. Yes, you're right. It's fine. Wait a minute. Hold on a sec. Hold the phone. I'm workshoppin' an idea here. You could leave, yes. But what if you stayed? - What? - What? Sure. Why be two lonely old women rattling around in your stained caftans and shower caps alone, when you could do it together? - Uh-- W-- Jack, sh-- She doesn't want to stay here. - Well, I-I-I-I could stay for one night, I-- Or seven. Or a whole month. Stay until you feel better, Mari. She-she already feels better. Silly, did-did-didn't you hear her singin'? Jack, before I forget, I think I saw something shiny in the hallway, wanna have a look? Ooh, I'd love to. Where is it? Why are you hiding it from me? It's right here. What the hell are you doing? I can't live with my mother! Don't you realize the crimp that is gonna put in my theoretical social life? Shame on you. That woman suffered through heterosexual sex, and give birth to a bloated lump. And this is how you thank her? I thanked her plenty with 30 perfect piano recitals, and long letters from government leadership council. - Fine! Uninvite her. - Fine, I will. Is everything all right? Yeah. I-I just think it's best if-if you stay. Really? Yeah. Why don't you go to the linen closet and pick out a duvet with contrasting sheets? I'm so lucky I had boys. Anyway, Leo and I talked about it Excuse me, can you not be so stingy with the bagel chips? And I'm asking as a rich Irish woman. - Anyway, we talked about it. And we decided that we don't care if you don't like him. - Oh, that's fantastic, honey, 'cause I really don't. Well, I don't care. More importantly, Leo doesn't care. That's my high school yearbook. 876 people, all of them like me. - Leo, what are you doing? - Listen! Excuse me. Maria Ginetti. Let's see what she wrote "Never change." You know why she didn't want me to change? Because she had a moustache? Because she liked me. I got a hundred never changes. I got 300 K.I.T's. "Keep in touches." Homecoming king funniest most popular. Oh look, here I am hosting our school's Night of a Thousand Laughs. The reviews for that? I'm glad you asked. - Leo. I thought you said you didn't care. - Well, I do care! I mean, I-I-I I'm good looking. I'm a doctor. I'm funny. Maybe you don't see it. But there's a certain entertainment reporter at the Sandy Springs High School Chronicle that just might disagree with you. - "Not since the Spanish Club's production of El Grande--" - All right, all right! Enough! Hey, hey, hey! You need to cool down, and get me bagel chips. Okay, what are we gonna do about this? You see, the thing is if you don't like Leo, we're gonna end up spending a lot less time together. I mean, I'll-- I'll see you at work. Or as you like to call it, the sleep-it-off place. But that's it. No, honey, that would kill me. Hey, okay. How about this? What if I pretend to like him, just like I do your other husband, Will? Interesting. Leo, would, would that work for you? Let me get this straight. If anybody asks, or if, let's say you ever have to sign a yearbook, you'd say you like me? That's great. So, in effect, everyone really does like me. All right, then, we're all friends. On the surface, where it counts.   
                




                    			What is it about "Smallville" that brings out both the teenage girl and the lecherous old man in me? It's the writing. So how's living with your mother? Think you'll do a Christmas card together? Maybe you guys and a couple of schnauzers? Don't remind me. I spend every minute with her. Museums, shopping, hair appointments. In the last seven days we've had eight dinners together. Don't ask me how. - Where is she now? - Well, we had an early dinner. I sent her off to see Gypsy. We'll probably get a quick bite later on. Oh, now I see how that works. Hmm, interesting. "Smallville" night. Oh, I used to be a part of that back in the day. Don't have time for it anymore. Why? Got one-liner in an off-broadway play. Who are you playing? A guy that smokes an imaginary cigarette? Maybe. Maybe I should talk it over with James Earl Jones. He's starring opposite me. Opposite you, or across the street from you? Here, drink this. Don't mind me, I'm not even here. Hello, boys. Grace, you must have a very understanding husband. I am going to take a long tub. But before I do, does anybody have to make? Will? I'm good. I hate when she talks to me like a child. "Does anybody have to make?" Oh, shoot, now I do have to make - Honey, I am so proud of you. Acting in a play with James Earl Jones. - I know. One of the greatest large black actors of our time. How did you do it? Well, you know, Karen, it's such a crazy story. There was an open call. I tried out, and I got it. I didn't even know you could get parts that way. Good morning, fellow actors! Ahh, the smell of an off-broadway theater. It's always worse than you remember. Mr. Earl Jones. I'm Jack McFarland. I just wanna say what an honor it is to be working with you. The theater is, well, it's my life, you know. I live it, I breathe it, I fondle it till it falls asleep. But more importantly, I respect it. By the way, do you know what play we're doing? The Iceman Cometh. Cometh. You are outrageous, James Earl Jones! Filthy and outrageous. Would it be forward if I asked you to lift me above your head? - I'm sorry, I hurt my back doing that for Kevin Costner. - Ah ha. Yes. Mr. Jones, I only have one line, but I was thinking of saying it a few times in different accents. Thoughts? Jack, as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter if you have one line, or 437 like me. You and I are the same. Yes, I have two Tonys and most recognizable voice on the planet Otherwise, you and I are the same. You know, I've always thought that. But to hear you say it Wow. What are you doing here? You're married. You should be at home getting fat. I know, right. But ever since Leo's been home, he's just had a lot of extra energy. He wants to do it like twice a week. Together. So I've gotta tone up. What kind of shape do you have to be in to just lay there? Good shape. Anyway, I started with a trainer last week. You're paying for a trainer? Is that so hard to believe? Kind of, you tried to have a cavity filled at a street fair. That's cute. Did you think that up while you were living with your mother? Could you not bring up mother, please? The gym is the one time of day I have to myself. Okay. Just so you know, that was a little Norman Bates-ish. Oh, okay, I gotta go. There's my trainer. What? That guy over there? He looks like he's already training that woman. - Yeah, I train with them. - Oh, I see. And do they know that? Look, why should I pay good money when I could just as well follow these guys around and do the same exercises for free. Because it's cheap and unseemly. And yet, I still don't live with my mother. - How many more sets you have? - Oh, I'm just getting started. You wanna work in? - Thanks. I'm Andrew. - Will Truman. - So, Will Truman, you here alone? - Will Truman, your mother is at the front desk. Yes, yes, I am. - Didn't they just page you? - Nope, no. I-I don't think so. Will Truman, please meet your mother at the front desk. Will Truman! Will, dear, are you here? I'm just a man who's scared of life and even more scared of dying. So I'm staying drunk and hanging on to life at any price, and what of it-- And you know what real peace means, because you won't be scared of life or death anymore. You simply won't give a damn. You're a liar. Okay, okay, okay. We're gonna have to stop. There's only one person that's acting on this stage. And that's Jack McFarland. Him? James, you're not giving me anything. Well, I have two friends that might disagree with you, Tony and Tony. Would you like to meet them? They're in my dressing room. I've also had two Tonys. Also in his dressing room. Who is this guy you're playing? It's called acting, James. Let's see some. Take five, everyone. Like I need this crap at my age. I've got Darth Vader money! "It's called acting, James." How 'bout some directing, Gordon? - You okay, honey? - What? You think all that bothered me? I'm fine. If you say so. - What? - Well, uh, can we get real for a second, honey. You are a big, gorgeous man with a dazzling smile and large sausage-like fingers. You don't need to act. Which brings me to my point. You can't. What? You gonna make me bring up my Tonys? Ugh, enough with those bowling trophies! Honey, that's an award they invented to keep gay men off the streets for a night. Let's face it, honey. You stink. Now, you haven't done anything good since "This is CNN." But what about-- Look I-- I was Mufasa. Mufasa? Honey, more like Boofasa. Yeah. It's bad. You know, you're right. You've finally said out loud what I've always feared. I'm a fraud. There you go, honey. Whew, it's out. Now you can let it go. You know, I hear they're hiring at Lady Foot Locker. If I could only be more like that Jack, the way he breathes so much life into one line. Well you can't compare yourself to Jack McFarland. - After all, he is one of the foremost acting teachers in this city. - He's a teacher? You think I can get into his class? Eesh, I don't know, honey. It's like a hundred bucks a month. But that's exactly what I need. I haven't been to a class since Lee Strasberg. I sat between Marlon Brando and Shelley Winters. Honey, no offense, but how did that bench not break? Who said it didn't? - Hey, Will, right? - Yeah. Are you here alone, or are you here with your mom again? - My mom? Please - Oh, there you are, Will. I'm borrowing your flip-flops for the shower. I'm with my mom. Come on, I don't even need this muscle for sex. What? I didn't say anything. My mother was here. Again! Third time this week! The only person that goes out in public with their mother more is Kevin Spacey. Tell her it's time to go home. - I can't. You should've seen her when we were shammying off the mini-blinds. She hugged me and said it felt like Christmas came early this year. - Well, you know, you're gonna have to be honest with her. It's the only way. Oh, nice advice, coming from the first woman to steal exercise. - Okay, let's take a break. - Ooh, it's about time. - What? - Why do you keep "whating" me? And your shorts are up your butt. Oh, Grace. Grace, Grace. I-I have a little problem. Can I talk to you about it? You know, girl to girl. Um, heh-heh, well, wouldn't you rather do that with Will? I don't like that kind of joke. And besides, Will is the problem. - What do you mean? - I am dying to get out of there. He's driving me crazy. Always including me in his plans. I swear to God, if I have to get up at 5 A.M. to go to one more flower mart! Well, you should just tell him that you're ready to leave. I'm sure he'll be fine with it. Beyond fine. I'm not like you, Grace. I just can't say anything that pops into my head. And, besides, he is so much happier and regular since I've arrived. It would devastate him. - Mom, come on, or we won't get to spin next to each other. - Coming, son. Hello, everyone. Welcome back to class. Now, remember, we are guests of the owners of this theater here today. So if you see any of the owners, hide. Now, we have a very special friend joining us today. He is an acting legend, known for such memorable roles as Oh, get out of town! You did a "Lois and Clark?" Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. James Earl Jones of TV's "Lois and Clark." Make some noise. - Thank you. Thank you. - Now Let's just jump right into it. Jiminy, what do you got? - I did prepare a monologue from King Lear. - Ooh, tough. Who would you like to do this monologue with? Just me. Uh, all right, it's a little unorthodox, but, hey, I give you points for moxie. Let's do it. Yeah, let's see. Action, please. - Blow winds! Crack your-- - Whoo! And stop! Stop. Okay. Let's start with the voice. It's fine for a lesbian, but you're a man. You want to-- You wanna be up here real high in your head voice. Not down here. But real high up here, okay, La la la. - La la la. - La la la la. - La la la la. - A little more nasal. Nasal, like, lady. Lady! Good! It's all part of lightening up, James. We gotta lose the James Earl Jones, and find the James Girl Jones. Now. We're gonna do a scene from "Sex and the City." Joanne, would you like to help us? Great! I'm still on a high from my Monostat 7 callback. - Mr. Jones, may I just say I am such a-- - Stop gushing, Joanne, you're a commercial actress. Okay. And you're walking with purses. And action. - Oh, Samantha, I'm so nervous. - James, James. Uh, did you get mugged? Where's your purse? Oh, Samantha, I'm so nervous. Big is in town, and I don't know what to do. You don't what to do, or you don't know who to do? Oh, Samantha, you're so terrible. But those Jimmy Choos are to die for. James, the voice, okay, Jimmy Choos. - Jimmy Choos. - Jimmy Ch-- Up here. - Jimmy Choos. - No, it's Jimmy Choo! Jimmy Choo! - That's better, excellent, better. Russell, take your shirt off. - Why? 'Cause we got a lot of work to do. Honey, cover up. I can see you. Will, can I talk to you for a second? - What's up? - Great news. Your mom's sick of you, and wants to leave. - She does? - Yeah. Isn't that great? - No, it's not great. I'm her son. Mommy! Are you sick of me? - Of course not. Where did you get such a crazy idea? - Grace said you said. - I said no such thing. - Yes, you did. And you said you're sick of her. I did not! Would I handwash the stockings of a woman I'm sick of? Grace, what's wrong with you? You seem to enjoy causing trouble. Oy, goyim - Well, I don't know what that was all about. - Me either. Oh, I hear they're gonna have gerbera daisies at the flower mart tomorrow. We should get up early. - Darling, I'm sick of you. - I'm sick of you too. I really can't wait to leave. I mean, if I have to watch one more documentary about an alternative family and pretend to be moved I'm going to jump out the window! And if you call my doorman oriental one more time, I'm going to have to find a new building. - Can I go home tomorrow? - Tomorrow? Why not tonight? Excuse me. Are you working out with us? No. I don't even know you, Josh. - Then how did you know his name was Josh? - Oh, shut up, Carol. - You know, I don't do this for free. - Oh, I'm shaking. What are you gonna do? Send me to exercise jail? And P.S., You're not even worth it. I haven't noticed any changes in my body. If anything, my ass has gotten bigger. That's because this work out is designed to make Carol's butt larger and her chest smaller. Oh, dear God. What have I done? - Honey, this is so exciting. In five minutes, that curtain is going to go up. And you're going to make your big debut! - I know Anyway, I should get home. Wait! Karen, I need your support. I'm really worried about James Earl Jones. He has made no progress at all. A week in my class, and his hair looks exactly the same. Have a good show, Jack. He can't even do that. Oh, honey, this isn't one of those shows where everyone wears a hat? - James, you were amazing tonight, amazing! - I know. I already called my family. It was only five cents a minute. - Mr. Jones. Hi. I'm a friend of Jack's, and I just wanted to tell you, that you were brilliant. - That's very kind of you. But no, I will not record your outgoing message. Hey, J-Jo. Nice work out there. Listen, uh could I ride on your shoulders for a few minutes? Oh, all right. I'll go change into my Juicy Couture sweats and meet you in front of Sardi's. Jack. I got to thank you. That week in your class really helped me. Got me back to basics. You got me to the place where I knew nothing about acting. Because you know nothing about acting. Well, you're welcome. So, I'll see you tomorrow in class. We'll be doing selections from L'Oréal commercials, okay, so bring a wig. - Actually, you won't. I'm leaving your class. - Oh. Okay. So I'll see you here tomorrow night at the play. Actually, you won't. I had you fired. You're a lovely person, Jack, but I'd rather share the stage with a dashboard bobblehead. So, in future, let's all remember the words of that great Dane, "the purpose of playing, was and is to hold, as it were, the mirror up to nature." Great Dane. Yeah, right. Like a dog can hold a mirror. Will, what do you think? - Not bad ? - Yeah, they're great. Where did you get them? Your closet. We're the same size, isn't that cute? I guess it's only fair. I used to try your new clothes when I was a kid. Listen, we should go. But you know what we Let's start having a regular lunch or something. I would like that. More "us" time. My ankle! You can still walk on though? Please! What do you know two to five more weeks of "us" time!   
                




                    			Hey, big news, Will! I've discovered a universe where your egg-headedness is celebrated and your feta cheese thighs are overlooked. It's the gay spelling bee. A gay spelling bee? Can we do that? What happened to the policy of "Don't ask, don't spell"? No, silly. It's a real spelling bee. With gay contestants and gay words. Like "flounce" "hydrangea" "set design by" Come on, I need a coach! Sorry, Jack. I'd love to, but my mom's still here. I can't leave her. Oh 'Cause you're gay? No! Because she hurt her ankle, because she's in a wheelchair. And what you said. Hey. Oh, hey, Leo. You're tall, with girlish lips. You want to coach me for the gay spelling bee? You know I'd love to, but my voice is still a little bit hoarse from the bisexual hog-calling contest. Grace is sick. I just came by to pick up some of Will's magical consommé. Well, where am I gonna find a coach? Heigh-ho! - Oh, hey, Kare, would you-- - Sure. - But you don't even know-- - Sounds great. - But if I told you-- - Come on, let's get started. You'd think Karen would have learned her lesson. It's the same way she wound up becoming husband number eight to Elizabeth Taylor. So Grace still isn't feeling well? I thought food poisoning was supposed to be, like, a 24-hour thing? It is if you stop eating the shrimp. - Well, why didn't you just throw it out? - I did. The soup's almost ready. I just have to, um. Could you just turn away for a minute? Why? My secret ingredient. And I don't like people to know. Okay. You can look. Ooh! I just realized I have the perfect container. Heat-resistant Tupperware. You have a really full life, don't you? Yeah, but I'm about more than just consommé. do a savory corn chowder and a ginger carrot that's won awards. In my own personal soup contest. See, you're not just about being a lawyer. You--you have your soups. I don't have a soup. What's going on with you? I don't know. I I mean, I gave up Doctors Without Borders to be with Grace. And--and it's great. I-I just, uh I-I miss it sometimes, ya know? Well, it's an adjustment. You haven't been back that long. You're still getting settled. Big cast changes at Thoroughly Modern Millie We're all a little off. Yeah, but, you know, they made me an offer. They, uh, want me to come over to Cambodia and set up a clinic. It's a six-month commitment. No, no, no, no, no. You can't do that, 'cause Grace will freak out. I-I know, but I can't turn it down. I mean, I miss the excitement. Here there's no civil wars, there's no cholera, there's no epidemics. There's--there's nothing to do! Nothing to do? Look, if you can say that, then you don't know this city, my friend. You give me 24 hours, I'll show you Will Truman's New York. And you will never want to help a person ever again. God, that would be awesome! - Come on, let's go. We'll drop this off to Grace, and then we will hit the town. - What about your mom? I'll just double her medication. If I play my cards right, I won't have to see her till next Thursday. Here's your bagel. I put it in the toaster oven so the cheese and muscle relaxants could get all nice and melty. Finally, a healthy breakfast that tastes good. Okay, sit down. Come on, let's get started. Okay. Ooh, this is so exciting! Prepping for the gay bee. My brain is buzzing with knowledge. Okay! Your first gay word is "daiquiri." I quit. Let's turn on the TV and watch a Hilton sister milk a cow. Come on, Jack. "Daiquiri." Visualize it. Okay, now, we're at our favorite leather bar. There's a sign in the corner which reads, "If you're wearing a harness, daiquiris are free from 5:00 to 6:00." Do ya see it? I don't. Wait till the fat queen moves. Okay, now I see it. Now spell it! D-A I can't see it, the fat queen is back. Spell it! D-A-I-Q-U-I-R-I. Ha! Honey, you got it! Spelling is so hard. It's not nearly as glamorous as it looks in the movies. Let's cut through the bull. If you want to win, we're gonna have to cheat. So I'll write 30 words on my left boob and 32 on my right. What? It's a little bit bigger. And that's normal. No, Karen! You can't write the answers on your boobs! Why not? It's the only place in a gay bar that nobody's gonna look. No! That would be cheating. It would besmirch the reputation of gay spelling bees organized by drag queens in filthy tranny bars everywhere. All right. I guess I respect your integrity. Now come on! Let's get back to work. Ooh, here's a good gay one. "Doily." Doily? Doily. Doily. Doily. Could you use it in a sentence? He went doily down the street. Oh, doily. D-O-I-L-Y, doily? High tea at Bergdorf's. You are in for a treat. And you thought the personalized makeovers at the Kiehl's counter were exciting? I-I think you're maybe mistaking my allergic reaction for excitement. Well, at least we're sitting down. Who can shop for shoes for four hours? I know. Usually you need a whole day. Hey, nice choice, with the Louis Vuitton crocodile loafers. I'm surprised they make them in your size. A throbbing stump that cute bus-boy just checked out. Great. I was hoping that they'd be guy magnets. On! Here's a game I like to play with my mom. Try to find one speck of crust on these. You won't. And good luck finding this kind of excitement in Cambodia. Are you ready? And, go-- Leo! That's two hundred dollars worth of cucumbers and cream cheese! You're eating like you just got out of prison! I did! Four hours in the frickin' shoe department with the salesman telling me I "move well for a man of my size"! Marco doesn't say that to everyone, okay? The only other big man he's ever said that to is Cedric the Entertainer. Will, I gotta be honest with you, man. This isn't workin' out, you know? Except for that one moment in the dressing room where that woman lifted her top in front of us because she assumed we were both gay, it's been kind of a bust. Wh--? You don't like Will Truman's New York? I find it a bit fussy. You're right. This is the wrong approach. Where's your New York? Well, it's not here. And to address your evening plans, it's not waiting outside Joe Allen's for Liza Minnelli to come out either. The word is "DeGeneres." DeGeneres? Can you use it in a sentence, please? I like Ellen DeGeneres. D E-G-E-N-E-R O-U-S? Oh, God, karen. I'm next. - Yeah. - I don't know if I can do this! I mean, look around. These are the best homosexual spellers from 14th through 23rd Street. Honey, I know how you feel. I once had to spell my last name for a cop. It's a lotta pressure. You're right. I just--I just had a little crisis of hope and faith-- starring Kelly Ripa, Fridays at 9:00 But, uh, I'm okay. I'm okay. Thanks. And thanks for believing in me. Oh, you're welcome. Contestant 12 to the dais. Excuse me. Hags must stand ten feet back from the stage. Oh, of course. I'm sorry, I forgot about the Grace Adler ordinance. I'll be right over here. The word is "taffeta." Taffeta. Could you use it in a sentence, please? I like taffeta. Thank you. Taffeta, T-A-F-F-E-T-A, taffeta? Correct. Yes! All right, Rangers! Whoo! Whoo! Yeah, that was exciting. Maybe we can keep the beer on our own laps. Let's go, Rangers! Let's go, Rangers! Let's go, Rangers! Sorry, I just assumed they'd stop while we were clapping. No. Oddly, they play all through our clapping. Pass! Pass! Come on, pass, you--you hot French-Canadian god! Too far? No, no. Drunk, belligerent hockey fans love a gay catcall. Oh, great. Well, that was a good game. A little long, but fun. That was just the first period. Oh, good. I got confused. At Beauty and the Beast on Ice, the buzzer means one of the utensils fell. But good, good, good! More hockey fun. Bloody tooth in my soda. Will, I gotta go. Oh, Thank God. 'Cause this guy's hot dog burps are so strong, I could spread mustard on 'em. No, no, no. Cambodia. I-I think I gotta take that job. No, you don't. So just put it out of your mind. Just focus on the game and the fun we're having. Let's go, Strangers! Let's go, Strangers! Let's go-- It's, um it's--it's Rangers. And, uh, the clap you're doing is from West Side Story. Thanks for trying. Come on, Leo. Think of everything you've got here. You can't go again, you just can't. I'm sorry, man. I-I-I gotta go. I don't know what else is gonna help. Maybe I'll just get myself a helmet full of ice cream. Don't make it hard on your boyfriend. Let him go. If he loves you, he'll come back. No, we're-- We're not together. Really? Can I buy you a light beer? Do you really have to go all the way to Cambodia? Couldn't you just find a Cambodian family in Brooklyn and give them flu shots? Will, if I stay here when I don't want to, I'm just gonna end up resenting Grace. What's a marriage without resentment? How do you expect to raise creative kids? I thought you'd be happy to get rid of me. I mean, then you'd get your girl back. Oh, please, that's the last thing on my mind. Late nights sitting on the sofa, eating popcorn, watching bad TV. Ooh, when are you leaving? Because tomorrow night they're showing outtakes of "Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica," where he comes this close to hitting her. I gotta go talk to Grace. Maybe I'll put her in a good mood by digging some shrimp out of the trash. How are you gonna break it to her? I don't know. I was thinking I could start with something like, - "Grace, this isn't really about you--" - And you just lost her. Here, let me help you. Try something like this. "Grace, if you knew that I was in a place where I was unhappy, you'd want me to leave that place, right? And go to someplace where I was happy." Ooh, because if she says no, it's like she wants me to be miserable. Exactly. That's the key in dealing with Grace. You've got to rhetorically box her in, then you can work her like a puppet. Okay, okay. So, so I'll open with, "Grace, you want me to be happy, don't ya?" Trust me, then she'll say, "More than anything, Leo." And when she says that, I'm home free. How ya feelin', honey? I brought you some consommé. You're the best husband in the whole world. I love you so much. I love you too. Grace, you want me to be happy, don't ya? Not if it affects me negatively in any way. --O-W, J-O-B. Eyebrow job. D-I-R-R-R-T-Y. Christina Aguilera's "Dirrrty"? --H-I-S. Mom, I don't know how to tell you this. The word is "GQ." Did you say GQ? Congratulations. You've made it to the final round. Okay, Jack, since your opponent broke down while spelling "disinherited" if you get this right, you will be our champion. The word is "maitre d'." Uh, that's not a gay word. Of a roller disco. Maitre d'. M-A M-A M-A-- Do you know what it is? Oh, uh, excuse me, waiter. I would like some tea. I-T! Wait a minute. Karen, those almost sound like letters I'm sorry. Hag Number 12, you're gonna have to leave. Hey, get your paws off of me! Who do you think you are?! "R"! - M-A-I-T R - Eeee! A mouse! Eeee! Would you keep her out of here?! No! Jack! Without my help, this could end in a catastra-postrophe. Mom? You up yet? Okay, two more days, then I'm coming in there to check on you. Here's your Tupperware. Well, you didn't have to bring it right back to me. Then how come you made me leave my driver's license? Well, I just wanted to make sure you knew I wasn't giving it to you forever. Do did you talk to Grace? What did she say? She was great. I'm gonna go. Well, good for you. And don't you worry about her. She'll be a bit of a mess, but I'll take care of her. That's what I do. That's what I've always done. I'm her rock. Actually, Will, she's coming with me. What?! Grace in Cambodia?! She thinks the Khmer Rouge is make-up. She understood why I had to go, and we don't want to be apart, so she's comin' for the whole six months. What?! But you're not leaving for a while, right? I mean, I need a chance to get used to this. We leave in three days. What?! She's never been away from me that long! She'll never hold it together without me! You can come with us, if you want to. No, thank you. No. One of us has got to stay here and be the rock. Well, look who it is. My supportive friend and spelling coach. Got anything written on your freakishly tinier boob? It's only smaller when it's scared. Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I tried to make you cheat. And I'm sorry you lost. The only thing I lost tonight was your faith in me. I know. I screwed up. I just-- I didn't want to see you devastated. Well, shame on you. Shame on you for perpetuating the stereotype of the weak gay man who's reduced to hysterics under the slightest bit of stress. She's leaving! Oh, my God, she's leaving! It's okay. It's okay for you! I know, honey. It's terrible. It's just like saying that certain religious groups are cheap. There's my penny! I'm sorry, honey. I just wanted you to win so badly. Well, that's no excuse. There are more important things in life than winning. But I wouldn't know what they are. Because I won! - Shut your pansy pie hole! You did not win! -I did! What?! Um, 105 bucks I won Travel Scrabble. And this trophy, which I can only keep overnight because they need it tomorrow for the shemale egg toss contest. Honey, how did you do it? Did you spell maitre d'? No! No one could. Not even the judge. And he's a maitre d'! They went to a bonus round. But the other guy couldn't get "erect." I, however, could. Hey, pukey. How are you feelin'? Just a little nauseous, just a little achy. I'm so tired I could barely lift my head up. Yeah You're fine, aren't you? Don't tell Leo. If I stay in bed, he'll have to pack for me. Can I get in? Okay, but before you do, I just wanna say that we are not gonna do this big emotional good-bye with the tears and the blah-blah, like gross people do. Of course not. That's not us. Plus, what's the big deal anyway? Six months, it's nothing. It'll go by like a Drew Barrymore marriage. Wouldn't that be closer to eight months? What?! No, no, not gonna do this. Eight months. It's nothing. You think I'm doing the right thing? I think you have to try. I mean, you've tried everything else. So what are you going to do in Cambodia? You know me. Yeah, I know you. And I'm still wondering what you're gonna do in Cambodia. Oh help dig a well work around the clinic hit the outlet stores. I think there's a Ralph Lauren there, five miles from where they actually make the clothes. Oh, remind me, I'll give you 20 bucks. You can pick me up 300 or 400 Polo shirts. What's gonna happen with Grace Adler Designs while you're gone? Got someone to finish up with my clients. And I found a replacement to wake up Karen every day when it's time to go home I guess you're all set. I guess so. - And we didn't even get all gross about it. - No, we didn't. I should get going. No, don't go. Everybody okay in here? Yeah. Can Will spend the night? Sure. Why not? I knew it was just a matter of time. When did you shave your legs? That-- That's me. I'm gonna miss our little girl. Yeah. Hope she'll be okay. Ah, she'll be fine. Grace is a lot smarter than we give her credit for. Welcome aboard flight 15 to Phnom Penh. We will now begin serving lunch. Oooh, shrimp. Yum.   
                




                    			Mom, these pantyhose are shot. I'll stop by the drugstore and get you some more later on. Oh, while you're there, will you get something for that itch I told you about at breakfast? I'm way ahead of you. I've already cut out a coupon. Someone please kill me. Hey, Wilma, I need your help. Remember Lorraine Finster, the dame who stole my husband and tried to bump me off? Well, I think I found her. Private Dick said he dug up an "L. Finster" at the Hotel Knickerbocker. Come on, let's go down there and give her the what for. As much as I love to put on a trench coat and go looking for your grip on reality, I can't. I have to take care of my mom. Oh, how sweet. A gay man living with his mother. Would you like me to preheat the oven, or you wanna just jump right in? Oh, hello, Karen. You know, I took your advice about overcoming pain with visualization. And you were right. So I'm just gonna throw these painkillers away. I'll throw them away for you. Right in the trash - Mom, what are you doing? - Oh, I want to go out to the terrace. I need some fresh air. Well, let me help you. - Oh, no, I don't want to be a pain, honey. - You're not a pain. The doctor said you're very fragile right now. And you have got-- To take-- --it easy. Careful, Baby Jane. Will, why is she calling you "Baby Jane"? Is that a gay thing? Am I a horrible person if part of me wishes that when I go outside, there's just an empty chair? Enough with that! Remember Lorraine, the husband who stole my dame and tried to bump me off? Private Knickerbocker says she's at the Hotel Dick! Let's get her! I can't, I told you. I've got to wheel mother through the park this afternoon. And then later on, I'll be scattering the ashes of my sex life in the Hudson. Hey, guys, look what I got. I put together a care package for Grace. You know, so she knows we're thinking about her while she's far away. Do you have her address in Pittsburgh? - She's in Cambodia. - Ooh, sounds like a lot of stamps just to mail a condom. Oh, enough of that. Jackie, I need your help. Remember Lorraine, the dame who stole my bump and tried to husband me off? - Well, the Finster hotel is private dick-n-knockers. Wanna come? - Sure! - Ooh, God, I'm sorry. I didn't even see you there. - Oh, that's okay. Mother? Are you okay? Didn't even wake her. She's a stickler for getting her 20 hours. - Well, I--I wasn't even paying attention. - He has the unenviable task of being my caretaker. - Oh, I'm sure he doesn't mind. - No, I do. I'm Tom. And this is my mother, Ruth. Well, I-I-I'm Will. And this is Marilyn. She's my mother. Although people say we look like sisters. That was stupid. I don't know why I said that. I thought it was funny. I love your wheelchair. - Thank you, I, uh, I rented it. - Is that a Roll King 2000? Well, if the Roll King is the cheapest one made, then yes, it is. Take a nap, mother. You know, you can make Marilyn more comfortable by getting her some adjustable foot pads. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Wh-where would I find something like that? - There's this cute little hospital supply store in Tribeca. I could write it down for you. - Great. Thank you, th-that sounds great. Okay, I'm gonna get my lemonade. You boys keep flirting. Mom, we're not flirting. Are we? I was. Your mother's adorable. Oh, thank you. Uh, yours too. She's my best friend. - Do you think that's weird? - No. No, no. No, I feel the same way about mine. - That's so good to hear, because so many guys I meet, it's like their mothers are impositions. It's such a turn-off. - They sicken me. Our mothers gave us life. They nourished us. They were our dates to the prom. Oh, I-- Listen, th-th-the greatest tragedy of my life was the day they yanked me from the breast of that saint. Heh If it's possible, you just got 10-percent cuter. Will, I saw a hobo who looks like your cousin Kathy. Would you go over and ask her if she is. Well, we'd better get going. I'm perming Ruth's hair this afternoon. - Oh, you're kidding. I'm doing Marilyn's hair. - Oh, you're not getting near Marilyn's hair. - Will we see you here tororrow? - Absolutely. We're here every day. - We are? - Yes, we are. She's very forgetful. Older than she looks. Had a lot of work done. Here it is, Jackie. Room 518, Lorraine's room. Ha-ha! We got her now! So, what are you gonna do when you see her? Hm. I've dedicated my entire life to finding her. But I haven't really thought this through. Well, let's see. Lorraine is from England. So if you really wanted to hurt her, you could hold her down and make her watch the American version of anything British. Or-- Or-- I could do to her what she did to Stan. Have sex with her until she dies! Yep, that's what I'm gonna do. Open up, Lorraine! And put on a condom! Huh, guess she's not here. Well, we'll just have to wait until she gets back. And as your friend, Karen, I want you to know that I will wait with you for as long as it takes. I am hungry for so string cheese. I may or may not be back. Hey, if you do come back, will you pick me up a Little Debbie? Oh, you love your Little Debbies. I do, Jackie. I really do. And I thought I was gonna have to leave the hotel to do my sightseeing today. - Hey, beanpole. Give me an alley-oop. - And what's the matter? Have you lost your key? No, just prefer going in this way. Well, look, if you want me to help you, you've got to tell me what you're up to. Okay, look. The woman in that room wronged me something bad. Now I'm going in there to sex the life out of her! I thought it was something like that. I'm not sure how high I'm gonna be able to lift you. My shoulder's a bit wonky-- Vietnam. Oh, terrible war. So many manicurists lost their shops. This happened last May. I was shot by a hooker. - Good morning. Enjoying your stay at the Knickerbocker? - Very, very nice, thank you. You know, these hallways are rather narrow. I had to walk right over this man. Whew, that was close. Okay, get me up here! Oh, no, it's not gonna work. There's no tall British guy on this side. Well, that-- Perhaps I can help you there. - Hey! How'd you get that key? - Well, it's my room. - But you're not Lorraine Finster. - No, I'm her father, Lyle. Hello. - Come on, mom. We're gonna be late. What are you doing out of your chair? - I'm walking. You can finally be rid of me. No, no, no, no, no! No, this is not good! No, you are--you are right at the crucial point of your healing process. You could set the whole thing back! - Oh, Will, come on, I'm fine. - Marilyn, you're not. - I spoke to the doctor. - I want a second opinion from someone who says that you gotta stay in the chair. For god's sake, will you just ask him out? You don't need me. I do need you. Right now the thing that Tom likes best about me is how much I pretend to love you. Yes, honey, but I get stuck with the mother. I mean, she's 120. She was a nurse at the battle of Gettysburg. No, I can't do it! I cannot possibly think of one more thing to say to that old bag of bones. So, you still feel the arthritis, even though you no longer have the leg? You're her father? I can't believe that bitch has a father. Well, the bitch does. Would you like some-- Would you like some tea? - No, I would not like some tea! - Would you like some scotch? - Yes, I would like some scotch! So, where is she? Where's Lorraine? You can't expect me to tell you that. You told me yourself that you were going to kill her with your sexual powers, I mean-- What sort of a father would I be if I just handed her over to you? All right, then. I'll find her on my own. - Or-- - Or what? Or we can make an arrangement. Perhaps for every kiss you give me, I could give you a piece of information. That's outrageous! You must think I'm a common whore! So, do you want my top on or off? Well, I'm a gentleman. So why don't you keep it on, and I'll rip it off? Do you know where she is? Yes. Where is she? I don't know. Didn't you just say you knew where she was? Yes, I did. Wait a minute. You have no idea where she is. You're just scamming me so I'll keep kissing you! Aren't you? Yes, I am. I can't believe I fell for this. You and your daughter are both the same. Tall British men with moustaches that tickle when we kiss. Look at 'em over there. Partners in crime. Thick as thieves. Don't you wish you had a camera? I imagine Ruth's very photogenic. She was stunning in your prom photo. It's a wonderful age. I can't wait to catch up to her. Wouldn't it be nice if we were older And we wouldn't have to wait so long - That was fun. - Yeah. Tom, your mother's partial's come loose. I didn't know. My hands just aren't clean enough. Thank God for Purell. Maybe if she'd stop talking for five minutes, it'd stay in. "Oh, look at my pretty hair. Do you like my pretty hair?" Please. I've got potatoes with prettier hair. - Marilyn? Mother thinks you're such a good listener. - Oh, well, I'm just in love with her. So, Tom-- I'm thinking, what about dinner tonight? We'd love to. Have you been to Serendipity? Mother just loves how soft their entrees are. I was thinking maybe more just you and me. Oh. Leave her? On Jiffy Pop night? You know what? Let's do it. Let me just run it by the general. Uh, hello, Lyle Finster here. Early this evening, I placed a reservation for a petite Asian lady companion. Yes, well, I won't be needing her after all. Yes, I have the confirmation number here. Yes, sir. B-X-L-4-9. Thank you. Cheers. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I was looking for my friend. A bosomy spitfire? Big bosom? Spits fire? Have you seen her? Seen her, kissed her, felt her bottom. Nice, isn't it? - Lyle Finster. - Finster? Finster! I'm Jack McFarland, nice to meet you. So, was Karen here? I have a tasty snack for her. So did I. But unfortunately, she didn't want it. You're dirty. Dirty with a German accent. Doesn't get any better. Thank you, I-I-I'm sorry, but your friend isn't here. I-I-I tried to get her to stay, but unfortunately, she wanted absolutely nothing to do with me. You see, I am the father of her rival. - Candy Bergen? - Lorraine Finster. I am the father of Lorraine Finster. Finster! You're Lorraine Finster's father! Clever. Now, you know where Karen is. Because I have to find her. I mean, I cancelled Lili for her. And Rita but that's a whore of a different color. Forget it! Karen is my closest friend, and I'm not going to do anything to help you! You're the enemy! That's exactly what she said. But, uh, we managed to negotiate after a series of kisses. I don't suppose that would work for you, would it? Don't be so sure. I wasn't sure about leaving mother alone, but I'm glad I did. I can't remember the last time I went to a restaurant after 5:30. So, do you really like me, or do you always cut up your date's meat? I like you. - Let's do this again. - I'd like that. Here's your penne. I had them double-wrap it. Mister you know the way to a man's heart. - Excuse us! Coming through! - What happened? Old lady got hurt. She was making Jiffy Pop and her wrist snapped. - Mother?! - I was alone! I wanted popcorn. My poor mother. Why did you make me leave her? This is your fault! She needed me and I wasn't there for her! Did-- She-- She just hurt her wrist. I mean, th-the woman is missing a leg! She could have died, mother hater! That's right, mother hater! And to think I was going to suggest the four of take a disabled cruise together! Buck up, general! Freak! So, lunch tomorrow? Ah, Oprah. What are you doing on that horse? Hello, Karen. What the hell are you doing here? How did you find me? Well, shortly after you left, a queer little fellow turned up with this. A Little Debbie. Look, I wanted to apologize for my behavior. It was wrong of me to mislead you. But the truth is, I don't know where Lorraine is. I mean, we've lost contact. And I was wondering if-- if you and I could look for her together. - In your dreams, big Ben. - Well, how about dinner then? - I've had my dinner. - Coffee? - No, thanks. - Raunchy sex in the back of a dirty cab? - I don't think so. Look, Karen, I know that you felt something when I kissed you. You know how I know? Because unlike a certain Vietnamese person of my acquaintance, you didn't shoot me. The only thing I felt was revulsion. And sloppy bridge work. Look, Karen, I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. I've let a lot of good women go, and a lot of bad women stay. And the ones in the middle-- I've been rather mean to. I'm not a boy anymore. And it's time for me to get relatively serious with someone that I kind of just met. So, you're not going to get rid of me easily, Karen. I'm going to stick to you like bangers to mash. You're not getting your banger anywhere near my mash. I'm not interested in you. Get it?! So scram! All right, I'll leave you this time. But, um-- Before I go-- Before you go what? Nothing. - You all set to go? - I think so. Will, darling, I know it's hard for any man to imagine finding romance without the help of his mother, but trust me. It will happen. - If it doesn't, I'll just hobble your other leg and start cruising the park again. - Well, as long as I'm next to an elderly woman with removable parts, I'm there.   
                




                    			Well that was delicious. And now for the clean-up, enter the crumber. Someone got a new toy. I was wondering why we had Saltines and corn muffins for dinner. Well, I wore out the old one. This one's Italian. The American ones are sturdier, but I was feeling sporty. Italian? Good luck gettin' parts for that. - Hello? - Hi, it's me. - Hey, Gracie! Jack, it's Grace calling from Cambodia. - I'm not here. Hey, how are you? What's going on? Are you calling from the middle of the jungle? Pretty near the jungle. Ooh, no. No, no, no. Nine piece. This one. Hey, and don't skimp on the biscuits. Last time you only gave me one. I-- What's-- I can barely hear you. Oh, I'm at the clinic. It's crazy. You would not believe the work that we're doing here. No, original recipe. - Original what? - Oh, that's just what we call O-negative blood here. I help with transfusions. Well, I miss you so much. But I'm so proud of the work you're doing. Have you met Angelina Jolie yet? Oh, please. She doesn't have the stomach to go where I go. Oh, I gotta go. My order's ready. Your-- Hello? Our little Gracie. Saving the world. - Yeah. Where was she this time? Burger King? - Sounded more like KFC. Hi, cuties. Sorry I'm late. I have to leave early. In fact, I just left. So if you see me come in, tell me I went home. Karen, did you go to your physical today? Yeah, I did, uh-huh. Don't lie to me. You are on the board of Walker, Inc. now. You have to prove you're in good health, or at least the black market organs that make you up are in good health. I went to the doctor. Here, my x-ray. Happy? This is the x-ray of a cat. She said the same thing to me when I caught her with a bird in her mouth. I'm scared of the doctor. That's why I always skip the middleman and go straight to pharmacist. Karen, you have to go. Life is hard sometimes. You can't just crumb your way through it. So tomorrow, Jack and I are going to take you to the doctor, and that's final. Come on, Kare. Waiting rooms can be lots of fun. I'd like to introduce you to a fascinating new magazine I've discovered. - What is it, Jackie? - It is Highlights. And it is filled with challenging games and puzzles. I sent a riddle to them once. Never heard back. Excuse me, do you know how long we have to wait? I'm with Karen Walker. There's no way of telling, sir. Karen Walker! Is there a Karen Walker here? You know how much longer now? All right, Alice, take care. See you tomorrow. Excuse me, doctor. Maybe you could help me. It hurts when I do this. I'm sorry, I'm not a doctor. Just a student nurse. Did you say student nurse? Would you excuse me just for a minute? Think, Jack, think. No outlandish claims or crazy invented personas. Just be yourself. What a coincidence. I'm a student nurse too. Nothin' to be afraid of. Just take a deep breath and hallucinate pleasant thoughts. - You're doin' fine, Karen. - Yeah. - Nothin' to be afraid of. Just take a deep breath and hallucinate pleasant thoughts. Oh, my word. Honey, look. This is the strangest looking condom I've ever seen. Why, what an oddly-shaped penis the doctor must have. That's a latex glove. It goes on his hand. His hand? You bet it does. I'm not ready to be a mother. Hey, how's it going? I'm Dr. Hershberg. Uh, before I begin the exam, could you give me a minute? 'Cause I just had to give some bad news to somebody next door. - Oh, of course, of course. - Okay. Oh, God. Of course, if you'd be more comfortable doing it in the room next door, that's okay too. Damn you, God! Why? Damn you! Any hoozlebees. Mrs. Walker, how you feelin' today? Well, scared, but a little better knowing that someone in the next room has just gotten awful news. Well, listen, Mrs. Walker, this is a routine physical. You got nothing to worry about. You are in good hands. And, dude, I know it's fun, but you are not allowed to watch. Oh, no, Mrs. Walker asked that I be here. I'm her attorney, which makes me a lawyer. Which is just as good as a doctor, no matter what my parents say. That's cool. Hey, whose warm lemonade? It's not mi-ine. It must be ur-ine. Get it? It's a cup of piss. Doctor, since I have you here, true or false? Milk, milk, lemonade, around the corner fudge is made. Yes, that would be true. Should I be nervous that I don't see any diplomas on the wall? You guys, relax, I know what I'm doing. New York Magazine named me one of the top doctors in Manhattan. And guess who they didn't name. My lame-ass partner Dr. Joel Frankel. Hey, Frankel! Guess who's in here with a patient. Me, because I'm awesome, and you suck! No, really, where are the diplomas? Well, you know, I don't like to put them up because then it's like, "Hey, look at me. I'm the shiz!" Oh, Harvard. I went to Columbia, which is just as good, no matter what my parents say. Well, let's get this party started, shall we? Okay. "Are you currently taking medication? See attached." This is the catalogue from Merck Pharmaceuticals. Yeah, and a map of Mexico. - Okay, I think I've seen enough. Why don't you sit it right here? - Okay. - And are you ready for the Dr. Isaac Hershberg experience? - I am. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm okay now. Okay. Got it out of my system. I'm fine. - Okay, you're sure? - Yeah. - Okay. I got an idea. I got an idea that I'm already regretting. Uh, Karen-- Doctor, why don't you examine me first? You watch, and then you'll see there's nothing to be afraid of. Okay, whatever floats your goat. Okay. Eyes, good. Ears, yes. Nose. Oh, brambly. Uh-uh. Not good. Nurse, can you get me the nasal flashlight and also the tiny thingy. Unbutton your shirt, please. See, Karen, I remain calm. Just allow the doctor to do whatever he needs to d-- Here you go, doctor. Your instruments have been lubed and sterilized. And so have I. Hey, um, Nurse Sheila. You-- You were once my nurse at the sperm clinic. Hmm, I'm not so good with faces. Drop your pants. I'll see if it rings a bell. Thanks for bringing these over so fast. - I can do it slower next time. - No, I like it fast. - I'll bet you do. - I like a guy with a little meat on his bones. - More cushion for the pushin'? - Hey, you said it. So, uh is Dr. Frankel free? You should go. If she weren't my sister, I'd be tapping that ass big time. Doctor. Your professionalism has won me over. I will consent to a physical examination. - Fantastic. You mind if I get stoned first? - No. Hello, my large-breasted friend. Hello, Karen. What happened to you? When we left the waiting room, you were busy with your Highlights magazine, still trying to find the toaster in the tree. Doh! The tree! It's the one place I didn't look. And yet it was circled by the five-year-old before you. Where did you go? Well, while I was waiting, I met student nurse Clark. We started talking. Then there was some flirting. Little over the smock fondling. And then you can probably guess what happened next. - A lawsuit? - Under-the-smock fondling? Yes, and nursing. I enrolled in nursing school. And you know the best part? - You need money? - I need money! Tuition for the first semester is $2,700, so I'm gonna need a check by the end of the day. So how 'bout you give me the money, and in return, I make one of my trademark adorable expressions. Oh, Jackie, I love that expression. Hey, you know what other expression I love? When I say no, and you start to cry. No. - What? - I love it, I love it! - Will, are you hearing this? - I am, and I'm not giving you any money either. How dare you?! Nursing is my passion! All my life I've searched for my true calling. And this is it. Nursing! And if you can't support me, you are dead to me! [CALMLY] No, not dead, because a nurse takes an oath to prevent death. You have cramps that won't go away. And you have a smattering of adult acne. Good-bye! We're gonna give him the money, aren't we? Oh, honey, we have to. It's what we do. We're Will and Grace. Now, come on. Sit next to me on the couch, and we'll dry hump. Will. I got the results of my physical back, and I'm a-scared to open 'em. Will you look for me? What, you're afraid they're gonna find some blood in your alcohol? Dear Lord, if I'm okay, I promise I will dedicate the rest of my life to serving you. It says here you're fine. Ha-ha, fall for it again, God. Yup, you punked the Almighty. They just want you to start taking some calcium. - How come? - Well, you know, when you reach a certain a-- A woman of your-- You know, when you're in your f-- Rich people need calcium. I don't like it. Well, tough. You have to take it. Karen! Come on! Just pretend it's one of your Mexican tic tacs. What are you, some kind of calcium pusher? Trying to get me hooked on calcium so you and your calcium-crazed friends can make me dance like a calcium monkey? Fine, I'll just take my stash back to the schoolyard and prey on kids with bad posture. - Hello, you gorgeous gay man. Hello, Will. I got big news. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Us first. Honey, we called the nursing school. And we paid your tuition for the entire semester. And we got you your uniform and a pack of blank prescription pads. Well, half of a pack. We felt bad that we were so negative about your interest in nursing. It was a knee-jerk reaction, because almost everything you've ever taken an interest in is, you know, stupid. Aw, well, thank you. That's so nice. But I'm through with nursing. Okay? And my new calling, surfing. - And I'm gonna need a check for $1,600, okay? - What are you talking about?! We just spent $27 million on your nursing career! Oh. Then why am I yelling? Because we spent the afternoon looking for white Rockports and smocks with tumbling kitties on them. You get nothing. How dare you! Surfing is my passion! All my life I've searched for my true calling. And this is it! Surfing! And if you can't support me, then you are dead to me. No, not dead, because surfers believe in reincarnation. Karen, you are a junior sales associate at Walgreen's in Manasquan, New Jersey. Will, you're her wife. Good-bye! So how are we going to work this? How are we going to get the money back? I was thinking maybe we'd work a little "good cop, bad cop." More like good cop, drunk cop. More like good cop, bad breath. Hi. We're wondering if there's a way to get a refund on this semester's tuition for our friend, Jack McFarland. Jack is dropping out? Well, don't feel bad. He was here almost a week. That's three days longer than he lasted at acrylic nail school. And five days longer than at jeweled acrylic nail school. Oh, I can't believe it. You know, I have worked here longer than I care to say. I mean, if I'm here one more year, I'm gonna take out everybody in here and myself. But, you know, Jack is amazing. He's the most promising nursing student we've had since Pilar Palabunda. Honey, did you hear that? He's better than Pilar. Let's remind ourselves that we don't know Pilar. So Jack is good? Well, you know, I know he was only here a few days, but he had such an enormous impact. I mean, we all loved him. Student nurse Derek, have you heard that student nurse Jack is dropping out? No. They were lab partners. Derek really hitched his wagon to Jack's star. Somebody walked in and saw them. But, you know, we let it slide because of his talent and his aptitude exams were the highest in his class. Ah, look, beach blanket butt crack. Well, if it isn't the dream killers. Kill any dreams today? Honey, listen, we think you should go back to nursing school. Oh, really? Well, that just proves that you don't get me. My surfer friends get me. They say, "Hey, Jack, we get you." Jackie, listen to me. They loved you. Yeah. They put you right up there with Pilar Palabunda. That's the name you remember? You don't remember my name, or your own! But Pilar Palabunda rolls right off your tongue? Honey, that's only because that's the name I used to beat up businessmen for cash in Chinatown. - So anyway-- - Jack, Jack. This is a great opportunity. This is not like one of your pretend jobs: Actor, choreographer, pirate. They think you might actually be good at this. Don't you think I know that? Don't you think I know I'm good? Look, say I have found my "calling." Say I do become a "nurse," okay? Then what? I make a steady income. I pay my bills? I become a reliable, upstanding member of society? All of a sudden I'm not me anymore. I'm my worst nightmare. I'mI'm you! Jack, sweetheart. Please don't worry. On your best day, you could never be me. And I'm willing to bet that no matter what dizzying heights you reach in the go-go world of student nursing, you'll always be yourself. Honey. I know it's scary. Hey, when I started working in the corporate world of Grace Adler Designs, I was terrified. Would she like me? Would I be good at my job? And now look at me, honey. I'm one of the richest women in the world. Yes, there's no connection. But if you pause in the right places and emphasize the right words, it sounds very inspiring. Oh, Kare, if only I could be sure. - Oh, Karen, it's time for your calcium. - I don't wanna. - Oh, just take the damn pill. - Leave me alone! Oh, for God sake, give it to me. Come here. - Good girl, good girl. - Jack, do you see this? You're a natural. - Well, all I did was give her calcium to make her bones stronger. - More importantly, you just said "bone" without giggling. Oh, my God. I'm growing up. I said bone without giggling. Heh-heh. Bone. Oh, thanks for helping me, Wilma. You know, my bones feel stronger than ever. I smacked a servant today, and instead of just flinching, she fell right to the floor. Wait till you bite someone. You're really in for a treat. Come on, Jack! You ready or what? - Hubba-hubba! - Baby! - Oh, yeah! I think I'm gonna like student nursin'. And finally, a legitimate reason to wear white hose.   
                




                    			You sure you know what you're doing? Yes. We learned it in class yesterday. I've done it on myself, like, a hundred times. Yeah? And how many times on your arm? Oh ho ho! Will, very funny. Twice. Where are they? Karen went to pick up Grace, like, two hours ago. Hush, puppy. Your blood pressure just shot up. Think calm thoughts. I'm just excited that she's coming home. I wish it was for longer than two days, though. We got a lot of Tivo'ed "Dr. Phil's" to catch up on. Beautiful, beautiful. - What, my blood pressure's good? - I have no idea. I could see my reflection in this little thing here. Okay, kids, we're back from the airport. Now listen, before Grace comes in, I just want to tell you she's been through a lot. So don't say anything about her brassy red hair and chapped face. Let's try to be nice, okay? She's still the same slutty, flat-chested Grace we grew up with. Ironically, my Aunt Honey made a similar speech when I came back from my freshman year in college. Yay! Hello! - And you stink. - Oh, sorry. It's been eight days since I took a shower. - No running water in Cambodia? - No. There's water. Ya know, of all the Bodias, Cambodia is my favorite. No, wait. Zimbodia. So, come on, come on, come on! Come in! Tell us what happened. Why are you here? Your message was all garbled. Something about your mom's 50th birthday party. That can't be. Yeah, she guilted me into coming back for it. "How many times am I gonna turn 50?" Well, obviously, 25 times. - Well, we're glad you're back. And you look great, tanned. - Oh, it's a rub-on. Got it at the airport. I once got a rub-on at the airport. Or did I give a skycap a handy? Ah. All I know is, I made 20 bucks. I'm so glad to be here. I hate schlepping those bags around. That's the one good thing about Cambodia. The orphans are little, but they can carry a butt-load. Grace Adler: America's goodwill ambassador. Oh, man, that anatomy test was hard. You speak the truth, Arpie. But our reward is the funnest class of the day, Basic Procedures. Starring the glamorous Nurse Turner as our teacher. And if Michelle Pfeiffer in Dangerous Minds taught us anything, it's that it's so much easier learning from attractive people. Look at us, huh? Student nurses. We're like one big Benetton ad. Hey, after class, let's go to Benetton, and go, "Hi, billboard much?" Good afternoon, class. I'm Nurse Carver. I'm replacing Nurse Turner for the rest of the semester. She's decided to run for Miss Universe. Um, hi. I'm student nurse Jack. Uh, I just want to let you know that I'm your key student. So, um, if you ever forget your key, I'm your guy. Okay, Student Nurse Ass-Kiss If you're so smart, why don't you demonstrate, on me, how to take someone's blood pressure. Uh, I didn't know you could do that to a woman, but okay. - Wrong! - What? I have a large, flabby arm. You have to use the big cuff. - Oh, okay. I'm sorry, you were just making me a little nervous-- - Wrong! - What? - You have to take my resting pulse rate before you attach the cuff. Oh, okay. I'll just-- Right here, and let's just see-- - Wrong! - What? Ow! You give your key to Student Nurse Asian-Girl. You are no longer the key student. That's not fair! You're nothing like Nurse Turner. She was talented, well-poised, and looked great in a swimsuit. Sit down. You know, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but nursing is a life-or-death job. It demands absolute professionalism. Nurse Turner had her way of teaching. And I have mine. Nowshall I continue? Or does someone want to see me in a swimsuit? - I'm sure you would look lovely. - Wrong! Oh! Finally! A good, old-fashioned, American candy store. Back in Cambodia, it was all sugar-coated flyin' ants. A whole bag of those will make ya sick. Mmm, malt balls. Eww. Carob raisin. This country's not without its problems. Okay, so after we eat our candy, let's go get some dinner, okay? Something good. Because Doctors Without Borders dinner without flavors. - What's up with dinner? It's 9:15 in the morning. - Yeah, but I'm still on Cambodia time. It's, like, 2:00 in the morning for me. It wouldn't be 2:00 in the morning. It'd be--let's see, how many hours is England ahead of New York? Five. So it would be, like, 10:00. But I didn't fly that way. I flew West. - It doesn't matter. They're later, not earlier. Didn't you cross the international dateline? - Ooh, "Dateline." Did you see the Amy Smart interview? She seemed kinda hip. Amy Smart? Don't you mean Elizabeth Smart? Oh, do I? Who is Amy Smart? - The girl from "Project Greenlight." - Ooh, I hope they bring that back. - Okay, wait, what were we talking about? - I don't know. But somehow we ended up in the crappy jellybean section. Jellybeans make me mad. They shouldn't even charge ya for 'em. I've missed you. I wish you didn't have to go back. I can't believe I have to go to the Barneys holiday sale alone. Is that this weekend? The Barneys sale's my favorite sale. I know. There's something about Cameron Diaz rooting through a half-price bin that just says Christmas to me. I wish you could stay one extra day and go with me. - Me too. - But I guess that's out of the question, right? I'm sorry, forget it. I shouldn't even ask. - Well, I guess I could change my flight. - Really? It's just one day. And don't forget, with the time change, I'd be gettin' there yesterday anyway. You'd do that for me? 'Cause I'm sure I could find someone else to shame me out of my skintight taste. No, you need me. I can't go through another episode of trying to get your Danskin off your man skin. It is okay, Jack. She was mean to all of us. Yeah, by tomorrow, you'll have forgotten all about it. Easy for you to say, Burnadean. She didn't punish you by making you dance with a skeleton. Oh, hey, Poodle. Hey, united colors. - Karen, I had the worst day of my life. - And I had the best! I just played a super prank on Candi Bergen. I melted down her Emmys and made 'em into Cable Ace awards. Karen, I'm in pain. My teacher was mean to me. She humiliated me in front of the whole multiracial class. Poots, I know just how you feel. I had a tough teacher once. I was kind of a misfit. Trying to find my way in '60s London. And then along came this handsome black teacher. We called him sir. He whipped us into shape, and we all grew to love him. I wish I'd had a chance to thank him. But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume. - It isn't easy but I'll try - Karen! Karen! Karen! Why do you think Sidney Poitier hasn't returned your calls? It didn't happen. Besides, I don't think I could ever grow to love Nurse Carver. She teased me, she taunted me. She even threatened to put on a bathing suit. And Karenshe's heavy. Oh, when I hear stuff like that, it makes me so angry! What a rotten day. I'm gonna go home to sigh. I hope he's there. Oh, excuse me, sir. I'm looking for Nurse Carver. I'm Nurse Carver. Oh! I am sorry! How rude! I always forget that men can be nurses. What do you want? By the size of your pupils, I'm guessing an upper. I'm a friend of Jack McFarland's, and I want you to stop picking on him. Your insults are undermining his confidence. - Which one is he again? - Uh, the big sissy who will never amount to anything. - Oh, yeah, him. - So leave him alone! - And what will you do if I don't? - Well let's just say you're picking on someone I love. I may have to start picking on someone you love. Oh, say, two small pugs named St. Elsewhere and Chicago Hope?! Where are they? What have you done with them? Who's that large Hispanic woman holding them in one hand and today's paper in the other? Are you shaking in your boxers? Nurse Carver, I baked you a meat pie. Karen, what are you doing here? Oh, I was just having a little chat with your teacher. I think Nurse Carver has something to talk to you about. Student Nurse McFarland, great to see you, and excellent work on today's pop quiz. - But we didn't take one yet. - Well, I've decided to give you a 90, right now-- In fact, I'm just gonna go ahead and give you a final grade of"A" for the whole semester. Congratulations. See you at graduation. Karen What did you do to her? Oh, nothin', honey. Mama took care of it. This doesn't have anything to do with that photograph I took this morning of Rosario and those two dogs, does it? Completely saperate. Now come on, Poodle. Let's go celebrate your academic achievement the old-fashioned way. Using Rosario as a toboggan in Riverside Park? Well, thank God it's winter. It wasn't as much fun in the spring. Come on! You're taking too long. I wanna see what you bought. Wh-what do you think? I think somewhere Dorothy Hamill is skating topless. Hey, this is not a girl's shirt, okay? A lotta guys wear shirts like these. In Japan. When they go out. To be mistaken for women. Okay, here is one thing I know you are gonna like. Nice. When did you join the Century 21 team? No. It's part of my costume for the Sound of Music Sing-Along. I'm going as "re." A drop of golden sun. I'm impressed. Somehow you managed to gay up the Sound of Music Sing-Along. Thank you. I miss this. You know, I only met one drag queen the whole time I was in Cambodia. Patty Rice. - Hey, here's a crazy idea. Maybe you could stay one more day and go with me to the Sound of Music Sing-Along. - No, I-- Could I? Could you? I don't know, I mean-- I mean, I guess it's only one more day, right? So that means I would leave tomorrow and get there today instead of yesterday. Okay. Really? W-w-w-w-w-wait a minute. Are you doing this because you feel sorry for me? Because you think I'm lost without you? 'Cause let me tell you something, missy. I am. Totally lost. Will, I want to stay. You know how much I love the Sound of Music. And now I've got an excuse to get the blond braids back from Jack. Great, so you're staying. Here, go try on one of these velour sweatsuits before they go outta style. Oh! Too late. And yet, you still wear Japanese girl shirts. Hey, Joanie, it's Will Truman. Listen, Gracie's gonna call you and change her flight again. Can you use my miles to upgrade her return to Cambodia to first class? I want to surprise her. She what? Why would she buy a one-way ticket? Okay, thanks. Whoo! What is better than a cup of hot cocoa after riding your maid in the snow? It's surprising how many people are riding their maids on the Upper West Side. Well, look who's here! It's my school chums! Arpie, Ping, and Burnadean. Hi, guys. Oh, hey, Jack. Oh, you've got some good color today. We were sledding. Oh, look at you. Future nurses. Oh, the comfort you'll bring. The people you'll help. The patients you'll smother to end their suffering. I envy you. Hey, so what are you guys studying? Anything I can help you with? I can name all the bones in the human penis. I don't think so, Jack. Carver gave us, like, four chapters to learn for the test monday. So, we're going to Ping's house to study. We're gonna pull an all-nighter. Bernadean made glow-in-the-dark flash cards, and my mom's making parfaits! Flash cards? Parfaits? Fun! - Glucose-overdose! - What's glucose overdose? Oh, it is nothing. We did blood sugar in class today. I missed blood sugar? I'll probably miss blood salt and blood pepper too. What else did I miss? - Well, we did cover the circulatory system. - Aorta be a law against that! I don't get it. It is okay, Jack. You don't have to come to class anymore. You are so lucky. - We miss you, Jack. - Really? I wasn't in the way, being the smartest and the funniest? - We got to go. See ya. - Bye. Oh, Strudel. Is that why you were dragging your tailpipe all day? Because you miss school? I do miss it, Karen. And I miss my classmates. I was their Barbarino. But Nurse Carver was so mean too you. Maybe she was mean so I would try harder. Maybe she's the teacher who's gonna make me a great nurse. Honey now I understand what you're saying. Nurse Carver is a woman? So, what do you think? It was marked down five times. I either got a really good deal, or there's a big stain I haven't found yet. Yeah, it's perfect for Cambodia. You know, whether it's cocktails in a mud hut or just kickin' it in the killing fields. Hey, it's Vera Wang. It's Asiany. So, I just got off the phone with Joanie at the travel agency. What? Why--why'd you call her? Well, she's your travel agent. And I wanted to surprise you with an upgrade. - Will, that's so sweet. - Yeah. She tells me that you don't have a ticket back to Cambodia. Oh, yeah, that's-- It's a very simple explanation. I used her for my outbound flight, and I used someone else for my return because Joanie can't be trusted with a round trip. That's why they call her "One-way Joanie." - So, who did book your ticket back? - Um, I went across the street to her competition Two-way Tony. - So, do you have a return flight? - Yes, Will. I have a return flight. Satisfied? - What's the matter with you? Why are being so-- - Will you stop asking me questions, okay?! I'm not going back. I booked a one-way flight home because it wasn't working there. And I didn't want to say anything to you because I knew once I said it out loud, it would be real. There's a problem in my marriage, and I don't know how to fix it. Oh, sweetie. I had no idea. I thought if I went there to be with Leo, I'd be with him, you know? But he was working all the time. Once I didn't see him for seven days. I don't know what I would've done if they didn't have "Cambodian Idol" there. Anyway, we had this big discussion, and ultimately we decided that the best thing to do was for me to leave. Wow. So, what's gonna happen with you guys? He's gonna finish this assignment. And when he gets back in the spring, we'll see where we are. Did that sound mature? 'Cause I'm terrified. Okay. I know this seems bad, but you know what? This could be good. Because when you guys finally do get back together, it'll be because you both want it. - You think? - Absolutely. Take it from a guy who-- although he hasn't been in a serious relationship for a long time-- has read a lot of romance novels. This is very positive. I don't know. Really. Look, as soon as you guys get back together, and he tears off his shirt, revealing rippling muscles and a birthmark that proves he's not your brother, it's gonna be great. I hope so. By the way, I read that book. And there's a double flip at the end that proves that he is her brother. But it's still pretty hot. - So, what are you gonna do? You gonna stay out in Brooklyn? - Of course, it's my home. - Because I was gonna ask if maybe you wanted to move back in here with me. - Of course, it's my home. This shawl is gonna look so good with that shirt I bought. Hey, Sidney Poitier, it's Karen Walker. But, uh, you might know me as Lulu. Yeah, listen, you really need to call me back right away. I think I might be pregnant. If that doesn't get him   
                




                    			Thank you for making me go out tonight. It was either this, or try to finish Joy Luck Club. That damn book's been staring at me from the bed-side table for ten and a half years. Well, you need to get out. I know Leo's gone, but that doesn't mean you have to stop living, or stop-- Can I just do something? Brushing your hair. Oh, that subway was disgusting! It smelled like urine. Karen, we took your limo. Oh. I gotta stop drinking those Big Gulps. Hey, thanks for taking me out to celebrate my first month in nursing school. Well, poodle, it's a big deal. A gay man breaking into the ranks of nursing. It's like a butch girl playing softball. You just don't see it every day. Okay, Chris, my new guy, should be here any minute. I want you guys to check him out. I really like him, but I'm afraid he might be a little bit flaky. Why is flaky such a bad quality in a date, but such a good quality in a crust? Because you're a pig. Hey, out-of-work actor! Walker, party of five. Walker. Yes, I have it here. But I only see four of you. And I only see two of you. What's your point? My point is I can't seat you until your entire party is here. Uh, here, Karen, let me. I got this. This is a five dollar bill. Yeah. I'll just take two or three back. Ma'am, I cannot seat your party until all five of you have arrived. Chris will be here any minute. Let's just check our coats. Good morning, vest! Uh, mine's the tan Camry with the scratch on the side. What? This is totally now. It's very Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. It like it. It's a choice. Yes, but did you have to choose to be a lesbian comedienne, circa 1986? Ladies, am I right? It's okay, I can take it. The fashion forward have always been ostracized. I'm sure when Gandhi first put on the diaper, there were some sideways glances. Who got the last laugh? That's right, Gandhi. Ha ha! It's funny when it walks, too. Can I get an apple martini, please? - Hi. - Hi. Aren't you--? Sorry. - Aren't I what? - Oh, nothing, it's just that I was watching this movie last night. And I thought you were the guy from it. - You're not, are you? - Actually, I'm not an actor. But I get that a lot. Oh, come on, what difference does it make if you seat us now or when our fifth person gets here? Because we never have four people sitting at a table for five. "Never"? Well, what if five guests are sitting at a table, and one gets up to use the restroom? - Then, you'd be left with four. - Ah-ha! Four people! All right. I was hoping I wouldn't have to do this. But I see that I do. I am a student nurse. Honey, you're such a big shot. You're giving me lady wood. Well, Chris isn't coming. He said he was too tired to put on shoes, and he was just gonna stay home and watch TV. Thank God it wasn't something flaky. All right, this is ridiculous. We just need one more person. Excuse me, are you alone? Yes. But I do have a lot of friends. If you want to check my cell phone, there's a ton of numbers. Okay, don't talk, just hold my hand. My date's here. We're ready to be seated. Leo looks good tonight. So just, um, sit with us for a few minutes until the maitre d' gets off my ass. Then, you can return to your night. Heh-heh - My night? Please, I was just sitting at the bar trying to get through Angela's Ashes. - Oh, my God, I know what you mean. I just finished Joy Luck Club. What'd you think of the ending? I'll tell ya later, stood-up. Um, Karen, we just learned the Heimlich Maneuver in class, and I'm dying to use it. Could you choke tonight? - Well, honey You know that I like to support your education, let's try. - Okay. No, no. I'm okay. No. Not choking. - No, no, no. Still alive. Nothing. - Jack, Jack, stop it. Wh-what're you doing? Trying to choke someone with olives? You need fatty pieces of beef, or marbles-- Waiter? Ah, look at poor vesty trying to join in the fun. Gimme a break. I got stood up tonight. Did you, Mae Vest? I hope you didn't in-vest too much in him. Vest. Karen, that's genius. It's not even clever. You're just saying "vest" over and over again. Can I get another apple martini please? Hi, handsome. Sorry, it's the Pinot Grigio talking. Italian wines are so chatty. But be careful when they walk past you, they'll pinch your ass. Ugh, I'm at this awful birthday party for my boss. She yelled at me for an hour for putting regular milk in her coffee. And now, she's licking whip cream off a male stripper. Hello? Are you allergic to dairy or not? - That is quite a dichotomy. - Ooh, dichotomy. Hi, smart. Stephanie. We're about to cut the cake. Don't make me wish that bitch a happy birthday alone. Hey, would it be cool if I came out to talk with you in a little bit? - Sure, why not? - Great, I'll be back in ten minutes. Make sure you're still cute. Like people can control that. That maitre d' is still watching us. I think he's obsessed with me. Can you blame him? Oh! Look, there I go saying that thing I'm thinking. That's okay. I love it when people compliment me. Ooh, see, I did it too! - You have the most incredible smile. - I don't. - I feel like I've seen it before. - In Flemish paintings? No. In a basement of a bar on Amsterdam. Have you been to Grapes? Uh Yeah, a couple of times. Every Saturday night of my early 20s. Uh-huh. I think we made out. A-ha-ha-ha-ha! I-I think I'd remember that. It's not like I made out with every-- Wait, did you have a ponytail? - No. - Then I probably did make out with you. Oh, my God, Karen, isn't that Candice Bergen, your arch-enemy-slash-best-friend? Oh, my god. This is a nightmare-slash-delightful. Hello, Ms. Bergen. Hello, Walter. I know I booked a table for five, but the other four crapped out on me. They had to go see Blue Man Group. Apparently, it's only playing another four more years. No problem, Ms. Bergen. We'll seat you right away. Oh, she always gets what she wants. Damn that Candy-ass Bergen! Say, Walter, how's your boyfriend? Did he get that diamond broach I sent him? I remember you telling me he likes pins. He loved it. And I loved the diamond tiara you sent me. Well, I remember you telling me how much you like prancing around like a queen. - Your table will be ready in a few moments. - Thank you. Oh, I hope she didn't see me. We're in a little bit of a war. See, I crank called her and pretended to be The Kennedy Center. Told her she was getting a lifetime achievement award. And then, I said "psych!" But she got me back. Really? What'd she do? I'll tell ya. She waited ten minutes. And then, she crank called me pretending to be -- Get this -- The Kennedy Center. Told me I was getting a lifetime achievement award. Then, when I got excited, she said, "gotcha!" Can you imagine? "Gotcha!" Never saw it coming! Sitcom legends are so smart. Come on, let's prank her back. I'll knock her out, and you put her hand in warm water. Come on. No, Karen, I can't. As a student nurse, I have now seen the darker side of practical jokes. Just last week we had two cases of extreme chafing from victims of surprise wedgies. - Hey, Walker. - Hiya, Murphy. - What's shaking? - Not a thing. I'm in fantastic shape. Yeah, I saw you in Sweet Home Miss Congeniality. Those were two different movies. Were they? Not from my airplane seat You know, Karen, I hate to hit you up for a donation right now, but I'm working with an organization that restores the decaying facades of New York's oldest monuments. Wow. That sounds important. Well, here you go, honey. Thanks. Now buy your decaying facade a turtleneck and a big hat. Ha! I walked right to her trap! My advice, Karen. Let it go before someone gets hurt. Just the other day, we heard this story. Kid comes in. Kid's uncle's got his nose. Put it in his pocket. Misplaced it. Never saw the nose again. Heh, good luck breathin'. Huh? All right, forget it, Dr. Queer Medicine Woman. I'll prank her on my own. There he is! There's the man. What's the good word? Ew. Who are you? What're you doing? You're oddly confident and overly familiar. You met someone! Who was it? Was it someone in just a pair of sleeves and a collar? Did he complete you? I gave you my number. And you never called me. Yeah, you were too into me. Back then, I was only into guys who were into guys. - And what about now? - Now? Now, I'm, uh Don't tell me. You're dating someone? No, no. No, I'm not exactly dating anybody. No Great, great. Um, can I stay for dinner? Yeah, I'd like that. Hey, Can-Can. Listen. Honey, I've been thinking about us. Look, Karen, that was a one time thing. I'd never had sake before. No, honey, I'm just saying all these silly pranks, I think they're getting in the way of our friendship. What do you say we call a truce? Truce, huh? Okay. I just don't know if I can get a refund on all those bees. Oh, good. 'Cause I really hate to fight. Especially on your birthday. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy 75th birthday dear Karen Walker! Happy 75th birthday to you! Gotcha! Excuse me, it's kind of a special night for us. We're celebrating our anniversary and how do I put this delicately? How much free crap can we get? I'll see what I can do. Okay, wait, we're married now? Well, the way I figure it, if you'd ever called me that's where we would have ended up. Really? And how many years have we been married? - I don't know, uh, four years, five? - Nice, don't even remember. I'm sorry. I just don't want to think of a time in my life when I wasn't married to you. 'Scuse me. Question. What am I watching? What show is this? What? We're just doing it to get free appetizers. You've done a lot worse for a lot less. True. Carry on. - Uh, Stephanie. - Oh, hi, sexy. Hi, oblivious. - Oh, my God! I was supposed to join you. - Yeah, like half an hour ago! I'm sorry, I guess I lost track of time. Are-- Are you mad at me? Ah, yeah. Yeah, I am a little mad. I mean, do you think it's okay to say you're gonna meet someone and then not show up? Is that what you do? Is it your thing? Steph? I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was such a big deal. Well, then, I guess it wasn't. You know, you said you like my vest. You said I look like a movie star. If that's not a meaningful connection, I don't know what is. Have a nice life, Stephanie. Excuse me, I'm student nurse McFarland. If any men here need breast exams, I'm at table five. Okay? Men. Jackie, you gotta help me. Bergen just hit me with a double-double, and we gotta prank her back. Come on. No, Karen, I'm sorry. I am a student nurse now. I am not going to be your circus monkey anymore. Listen, monkey! You'll be my monkey until I tell you you're not my monkey anymore! So go grab your banana peel and throw it on the floor! No! Now, you listen to me, McFarland. You better watch your back. I can't. - Listen, guys, I think I'm gonna take off. - Oh, Will, you look upset. Don't forget to leave your credit card. Will, don't leave. Let me make it up to you. Let me buy you a drink. You think a drink is gonna make up for how you hurt my feelings? - You look cute when you pout. - I guess I could. Oh, I'm so embararrassed I just told you that. Oh, don't be. I think it's cute that you used to steal change from your nana's purse. - It's a little wierd it was yesterday. - Shut up! - Will, you didn't leave. - No, I decided to stay. Good. This is Alex. I'm Grace. - This is Stephanie. - Hi, everybody. Have you guys eaten yet? - No, we've been so busy talking we haven't even ordered yet. - Ok, then. What's good, what's good? Oh, you know, if you get a pasta, I'll get a chicken. Then we can share. That sounds good. If I get a fish and you get a pasta, I'll have half of your pasta. Ooh, you know who I heard has the best pasta in the city? Babbo. I've never been there, but I hear it's delish. And romantic. We should go. Should we go together? - That'd be nice. - Yeah, this weekend. - It's a date. - Okay. Grace. What're you doing? - What are you doing? - What are you doing? Is this the person you met? - Leave her out of this. - I'd like to, but she's fingering your hair. And he's holding your hand. Are you guys together? - No, of course not, he's gay. - And she's married. - You're married? - You're gay? Uh, hello, how many straight guys do you know who wear vests? And how many single girls do you know who wear a-- Who don't wear a wedding ring? - It's being resized. - Yeah, in your pocket, whore. I can't believe you. We're on a date! You thought this was a date? You offered to buy me a drink, then you made me feel guilty and horrible about myself. That's a date! Married? I can't believe this. All I wanted was to meet a nice girl Get to know her slowly And let it blossom into a meaningful relationship. And I just wanted get laid. Your thing sounds better. Let's go. Men. KAREN: Honey, help! You were right. Practical jokes are dangerous. I put a balloon in her soup and now she's choking. I think Candice Bergen is going to die! I told you this was going to happen! Honey, come on. Oh, my God! There she is! Jackie, do something! She's the last good thing to happen to the tiffany network. Uh, step 1: "Identify the victim." Oh, my God, it's Candice Bergen, I'm a big fan! - Step 2-- - Hurry, hurry! Loved you in Carnal Knowledge. Brilliant in Starting Over. Anything? Gotcha! Oh, that's the best prank we've played since we set up Martha Stewart. How dare you?! I thought her liver exploded! I was about to give her a tracheotomy. Honey. Okay, that's kinda funny. Confetti, Candice Bergen. Wow. Can you believe those two? They totally took advantage of us. He never once said he was single. And she never said a word about not having a penis. This is all your fault, you know. You're the one that said I should get out and live a little. Yeah, I meant change your underwear and brush your teeth, not pick up a stranger. Why did I do that? You're just going through a hard time. I am. I miss Leo so much. It was really nice to get some male attention, you know. Ew, am I that girl? We're all that girl. That was fun. Thanks for keeping me real, Kare. Nursing can be so stressful sometimes. It's important to remember what really matters. A cheap laugh at someone else's expense. You're welcome, Jackie. But you got ol' C.B. here to thank for that. If she had anything better to do on a Saturday night, none of this could've happened. You know, Jack. There's two things I've learned in my long career in show business. The first is, don't take yourself too seriously. And the second is, always wear a double layer of underpants when you're doing a bed scene with Jack Nicholson. But really, Candi, maybe we should slow down on the pranks. Hey, I'm willing if you are. Shake on it? Ha ha ha ha ha! Psych! Super Glue on the silverware. Classic Walker. Ha ha ha ha! Congratulations, Walker. You got me. Again. See ya around, slugger.   
                




                    			Oh, I tell ya, Grace. This is one kick-ass office Christmas party. I, for one, am having an absolute ball. You must feel so naughty drinking in the middle of the day. Oh! Honey, is there liquor in this? Well once a year. All right! I believe it's time for the annual Christmas bonus. And here it is. Wow! $1,000! Thank you! You know, a secretary on the second floor told me that the boss usually gives the bonuses. Karen, are you gonna believe those women? They're the same people who told you you shouldn't be paying for my health coverage. Merry Christmas! I'm wearing my holiday stocking. I guess you can't see it. Looks like things are in full swing. God, everybody showed up this year. That's nice. Have you heard from Will? I thought he was gonna stop by. Oh, right. He's not here. Oh! I'm sorry, honey. He did call. What did he say? Well, let me pull it up on the computer. Okay, here he is. "3:11 P.M.: Volunteering tonight at the shelter. Don't wait for me. I'll see ya tomorrow." I'll just flag that as 'read' and archive it. That's our Will. He's kind of a modern-day saint. Much like mine and Karen's Lord Jesus, he's a celibate man who lives to help others. Excuse me. Is this where you line up for Barry Manilow tickets? You're the first one. - What are you doing here? - I'm waiting for the box office to open. Tickets go on sale at 6:00 A.M. You do know this is the line for Barry Manilow? For his one night only A Very Barry Christmas? So, if that's not why you're here for-- It is! Keep your voice down. The whole street doesn't have to know. Damn it! I can't believe you got here before me. I've been following Barry around the country since 1988, and I've never been in line behind anyone. Ever. Well, you are now. I got here first. Isn't that right, Barry? That's right, Boss. Wait a minute. You're the guy that made his own Barry bobble-head? I know you. Do you chat? - Do I what? - The Barry Manilow chat room. Are you into it? Are you a fanilow? A "fanilow"?No. Maybe I've gone to the chat room a couple of times. Oh, yeah, a "couple of times." Bull crap, fancy nancy. I know who you are. You're "No One Fanilow". Number One Fanilow. Oh, really? 'Cause it looks like "no one fanilow" when you write it. Copacafana 82. You're Copacafana 82? Oh, my god! You're like the leader of the fanilows. Your web site is amazing! I love your pencil sketches of Rico and Lola when they were kids. That's so cool! - Yeah, I know. So can I get in front of you? - It's not that cool. Hey. What's this line for? Is it something free? Food? Eh, what the hell. If there's a line, it must be something good. Will? What are you doing here? I thought you were feeding the homeless. - Turns out they were just snackish. So, so, I decided to-- - Take the one thing that was good in my life and piss on it. What's going on? And where'd you get the little chairs? All right. I'm in line for Barry Manilow tickets, and I didn't tell you 'cause I knew you'd make fun of me. And why would you think that Mrs. Manilow? Quit it. What are you even doing here? I thought you were Hanukkah-shopping with your mom. I'm off the hook. She called and said she wasn't coming into town. It's a Hanukkah miracle. It's like that time in Hebrew school when I bit into that dreidel on a hunch and it turned out to be chocolate. Hey, look, could you do me a favor? I've had to pee for like an hour, but I didn't want to lose my place. Can you stay here while I go to the sub shop across the street? What if someone sees me? Well, then they'll be excited to meet the cat in the hat. Five minutes! Oh, no holdsies. What?! You're not the line monitor. Oh, this badge says different. And if you start messing with fanilow line protocol, you're gonna have a lot of white, middle-aged people angry with you. Can she hold my place if I let you be first? I think that'd be okay. I'll be right back. So, uh, are you a fanilow, too? Oh, uh No, dear. I'm a doctor's wife. Is that--? That is my mother! She said she wasn't coming. Why would she lie to me? I don't know. That's your mom? So you got this from your dad? Who's that cute guy that just sat down with her? Jack?! - Excuse me. Can I just scoot in front of you? I just want to get the bathroom key. - No, I've been waiting. People are amazing, aren't they? Hmm? Oh. Oh, yeah. - If I was at the front of the line, I'd let you in. - Mmm. Rudy. I really just want to use the bathroom. - Hello? - My mother is across the street having dinner with Jack. What do you think's going on? Well, what do you care? You didn't want to see her, you're not seeing her. I know. I'm just curious. I'm a naturally curious person who's interested in how things work in the world. I thought you were a naturally lazy person who didn't care how things happened as long as she didn't have to do them. Oh, yeah. That's who I am. Look, I'm gonna go and see what's up. No! Do not leave that line! If you do, I'll end up with second row center instead of first row center, and this is the only thing getting me through the holidays! Don't move! I'll be there as soon as I can. Look, I know I'm fat, but I got a decent personality, and I make my own clothes. I'm--I'm really not interested. I'd love to put you in a daisy duke denim romper. What size are you? No. Why would they even be together? I mean, not that I care. I mean, beddah him than me. That's for sure. Beddah him than me. It's just weird, you know, 'cause my mother lives for her weekends with me. So, so it's a little weird. You know what? Uh, even though I live alone, nobody likes me at work, and I follow a 57-year-old pop singer around the country, this is boring, so Could you just talk to the person on the other side of you? Wazzup? Honey, I couldn't understand your message. "Some mary needs a line of blow?" I'm in line for Barry Manilow. Look, I've gotta run across the street, okay? Jack is having dinner with my mother and-- Hey, you don't know anything about that, do you? I know about a misguided gay man and a deluded older woman who have needs just like you and me. Never mind. Well, you just stay here. Will was waiting in line for tickets, and if I lose his place, he's gonna kill me, or, even worse, make me go to the damn show. You look odd. I'm devastated that you've decided to turn your back on your acting, dear. Well, you know, Bobbi, sometimes when you turn your back, you create an opportunity for your front. Yes, but acting is your life, dear. Without it, you're just another sexually confused boy. Well, I don't know, you know. I feel like I've played all the great roles, you know? Man on bus, man at counter, man number 3. Woman. As a nurse, I only have to play one role: doctor. Excuse me, sir. I'm supposed to tell you that a very buff gentleman needs to see you at the bar right away. Bobbi, this sounds like a medical emergency. I just wish I had more time to put on a smock. - Jack! - Aah! Grace! You scared me! I'm gonna look all flustered for my buff gentleman. Jack, I am the buff gentleman. Wow. Conceited much? Why are you having dinner with my mother? Please tell me it's because you're still working on a drag version of her. Because she invited me. And I almost have the voice down. What's the big whoop? How would you like it if I had dinner with your mother? Oh, that's not gonna happen. My mother doesn't care for you. Mom. - Grace, what are you doing here? - Never mind that. What are you doing having dinner with Jack on our traditional Hanukkah-shopping weekend? Oh, my God! And you're even having a traditional Hanukkah short ribs dinner? Grace, I know you don't enjoy our time together. So I called someone who I know would enjoy it. Oh, well, great. Great, well, have fun. You don't need me, I don't need you. If you would rather spend time with Jack, then have fun. Live it up. "Beddah him than me" is what I'm saying. Beddah him than me. Such drama. She's never forgiven me for being the prettier sister. Your bathroom could use some freshening up maybe an orchid in a small vase, or someone could help the man passed out in a puddle of Liquid Dial. That's Tommy. He's on his break. Is that Barry Manilow order ready yet? So you mentioned a romper. How would that work exactly? Buttons down the front? Yeah, I guess. Subs are good here, huh? Especially to go. They travel well. And--and where will you be traveling with your subs tonight, I wonder? I'm Barry Manilow's road manager. He's got a Christmas concert across the street. Oh!? Huh! Barry Manilow. There's a blast from the past. Singer, right? Why are you talking to me? You seem interesting. I'm sorry. It's just that I can't flirt on a full bladder. I'm empty now. Hi. You're a fanilow, aren't you? A--a--a what? A what? A fanilow? Wh--wh--what is that? This is an interesting turn. To make it worse for you, you're actually kissing up to the right guy. I have direct access to the Manilow. I can even get you into the rehearsal to meet Barry. But you're not interested. Not so fat now, am I, brown eyes? So you and Barry are lovers? God, no. I wish! I've never even met him. But he has brought me to climax more times than any other man. And yet you stand in line on bitterly cold nights just to hear his music? I don't get it. - Well, have you ever heard his music? - No. He makes you feel like he knows you, like everything you've ever felt and everything you ever wish is okay with him. He makes you feel less alone in the world. Eek. Sad. No, it's impossible to be sad when you hear him. Okay, honey. Let's just agree to disagree on this one because I really-- Oh! Oh, my! Oh, why-- Why, that's just Look, Rudy-- God, you've got lashes for days. I think we got off on the wrong foot. Did we? 'Cause five minutes ago, you were looking at me like some monster you ran into in the woods. Are you kidding? Maybe a--maybe a hot monster. In--in--in in the forest of hunk. Heh. Grrrrr-rowl! Save it. You fanilows make me sick. But you did notice I got my lashes tinted, and none of the roadies did. So grab the Sun Chips, and I'll take you over to sound check and introduce you to Barry. You will? You are such a nice man! If you go ou with me after the concert. What?! Do you realize what you're suggesting? That is sexual blackmail! Yeah, I know. Okay, so long as we're clear. You know, I'm glad she's with Jack. It's better this way. Yeah. You don't need her or her supermarket makeup. You said it. And you know what I say? Beddah him than me. That's right. Beddah him than me. Don't talk to her anymore unless you want to hear that "better him than me" thing like a thousand more times. He could be her new daughter, for all I care. This is great for me! Great! Beddah him than me. That's right. Beddah him than me. I remember all my life, raining down as cold as ice. Shadows of a man, a face through a window, cryin' in the night, the night goes into morning, just another day. Happy people pass my way. Looking in their eyes, I see a memory I never realized how happy you made me. Oh, mommy ! Oh, you came and you gave without taking, but I sent you away. Oh, mommy! You kissed me and stopped me from shaking! And I need you today! Oh, mommy! Oh, Bobbi, I love spending time with you. I tell ya, if I were 30 years older and you were 30 years younger And a man. Wow! Imagine the feweworks! Oh, fireworks. I tell ya, these days, I'm lucky if I can get Mr. Adler's fuse lit. Oh, Bobbi, I love it when you work blue! Mommy. I need to talk to you. - You're back. What is it, dear? - Grace, what are you doing--? - Get out. - But you can't-- - Get out! It's not fair. You-- You're my mother, not Jack's. You gave me life, even though it almost killed you doing it, as you remind me every year on my birthday. So, not better him than me. Better me than him. Oh. So you wanna be with me? Yes. I mean, the holidays are all about misery and obligation and the Maccabees riding an elephant, or whatever the hell Hanukkah is about. And if I didn't have that every year, I'd--I'd miss it. Oh, dear, I'd miss it, too, darling. Oh! Excuse me. Oh, that's my mother. No way I'm getting that! Karen, Grace is after me. If you see her, fire a warning shot into her hair. Wh--what are we in line for? God, from the looks of this crowd, I hope it's birth control. Oh, honey, it's the most wonderful thing. His name is Barry Manilow. He's cuter than Deepak, and you don't have to buy a lot of crap to believe in him. This is Cheryl. She's a fanilow. The man makes me happy. This is Jackie. He's a fagalow. The mens make me happy, too. I'm gonna get you house seats for the show tomorrow night, but then remember what you said. You and me, a date. I know what I said. We're going on a date. So, where do you wanna go? Well, the band leaves on the bus right after the show tomorrow night. So you're gonna have to come with me to Philadelphia. We'll have our date there. That's the deal. Philadelphia?! City of brotherly love. - Follow me. I'll take you straight to Barry. - Oh! Out of my way, you stinkin' fanilows. Hey, wait a minute! You can't cut! Actually, I can. I'm going to meet Barry Manilow. And then he's going on a date with me to Philadelphia. But first, I'm gonna meet Barry Manilow. And then Philadelphia. We're going hoppin' today, where things are poppin' the Philadelphia way. We're gonna drop in on all the music they play on the bandstand. Bandstand. You're not half bad! Barry, I thought you were gonna clear out in a few minutes. Wait, wait, wait. You don't have to go. You can stay, stay! Please stay. Barry's gotta go. Yeah, I gotta go to the copacabaÑo. Ha ha ha ha!   
                




                    			There she is, the woman who set my heart on fire. Which is a nice change, since the women I'm usually with cause a burning feeling in an altogether different area. Get lost, David Cop-a-feel. Just because we once made out like drunk straight girls at a frat party, doesn't mean you're wanted here. Hi. Welcome to my office. And we usually reserve this kind of talk for casual sex Friday. Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there. Lyle Finster. Finster? Oh my God. You're Lorraine's father. You tricked Karen into kissing you. That's right. And it ain't never gonna happen again. - No, sir. Not on my watch. - I understand. But I only came here to return the kiss that you left on my lips. What? Give it back! If you'll excuse me, I'm just gonna go in the back and gouge out my eyes and puncture my eardrums. Oh, no, honey, stay. I was just taking back my-- Hey! Karen, I'm lost without you. I've tried to fill the void with secretaries and whores, but at the end of the hour, it's you I wish I was paying. Really, I'm uncomfortable. It's never gonna happen between us, Lyle. So beat it. Very well. But I'll never forget you. Every mouth that I kiss will be your mouth. Every bottom that I slap will be your bottom. - Every nipple that I tweak-- - Please, one of us has to go! - Get out. - Very well. But know this: Every vagina-- - Get out!! - Oh, I have to tell you something. - Me too. In your dreams. My mom called. My screw-up older sister Janet is in town. And you know that she's gonna show up here asking for money or a place to crash while they fumigate her van. So, whatever you do, do not open the door. Hey, Will. You said help yourself to anything in the bathroom, so I put your blow-dryer in my purse. Wanna hear my news now? - Hey, Smudge. - Hello, Janet. You look good. When did you stop shaving your head? I just did that 'cause my boyfriend Tony told me to. He--he thought I was too full of myself. Well, it looks nice. Mom will be happy. She may finally forgive you for using Aunt May's urn for your stash. Hey, I didn't know what it was. I just thought it was really dusty. On the inside? Um, Will? I'm studying for a test. What does "A.D.D." stand for again? Oh, my God! Janet Adler! Hi, cuteness! Look at you with hair! - You like it? Doesn't make me look like I'm too full of myself? - Little bit. So, where you staying? Um, der, right here. Will invited me. It won't be for long. Just until I can get my jewelry line going. Oh So Now you have a jewelry line. What'd you do, roll your old roach clips in glitter? You should see her work, Grace. She does these barrettes. Three tiny roses nestled in beadwork. It's adorable. I'm excited about barrettes, and that's okay. Of course you are. Finally, a way to dress up all that hair on your pillow. So-- Listen, I figure if I set up a folding table at St. Mark's Place, I could start getting celebrities interested in buying them, and then I'm pretty much set. Sounds smart. Nothing attracts celebrities like a folding table. Hey, it's gonna have a poncho on it. That could work. Salma Hayek bought one of my friend's handcrafted purses. Do you know what that friend is doing today? Stalking Salma Hayek. True story. Oh, Grace. I had to apply for a credit card in your name. I've got "warrants." - No, absolutely not. - Well, I have, um, Will's Sears card. You want that? Yeah, I'll take it. Thanks. Stop! No. No credit cards. No money. No staying here. You know what, I just-- I cannot have this in my life right now. You are a wreck. And I am sick of taking care of you. - I mean, how about you get a normal job? How about you find a place of your own? How about you get a life?! - I am trying! But it is hard! I am going to school, I am changing careers. So what if I need a little help every now and then? Why do you have to judge? You wonder why I don't like you. Now you know. - I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to Janet. - Oh, well, I wasn't really talking to you either. Grace didn't mean that. She just gets crazy when she's hungry. W-w-we had slow service at the Carnegie Deli once, she started going to other people's tables and asking if she could suck on their napkins. True story. Will, it's okay. She meant what she said. Thanks for the blow-dryer And the poncho. I'm gonna go. - Wow. You think maybe you were a little hard on her? - No. All I've ever done my whole life is clean up her mess. I just want a normal sister who I can count on. The only thing I can count on Janet for is a great connection to sleeping pills and all the lyrics to "Sugar Magnolia." I am with Grace. That girl's a leech. You gotta cut those leeches out of your life before they leech right off ya. Oh, hey, Will, can you help me move this table over to my apartment? I'm having company. Grace, grab the chicken. Yeah, listen, Ro-Ro, I'm gonna be a little late tonight. So you're gonna have to turn the hose on yourself and search your own room. Oh, that voice. It's like two cats screwing. Lorraine Finster! You murdering bitch! You've got a lot of balls showing up here. No, I don't. My parents had them removed when they decided to raise me as a girl. I have searched the far corners of the globe for you. Where the hell have you been hiding? I've been in the chorus of Taboo, the Boy George musical. - That is so weird. You know, I was gonna see that last week when I was at the two-fer booth, but I saw Little Shop instead. - How was it? I felt the plant phoned it in. What the hell are you doing here?! I just came to tell you one thing. You stay the bloody hell away from my father! - I'm not interested in your father! - Oh, really? My moles tell me differently. Honey, when they get big enough to talk, it's time to see a new dermy. Save it. You are not to see that man again. 'Cause if you do, I'll cut your insides out and serve 'em up cafeteria-style with creamed corn and dirty silverware! All right, all right. Say it, don't spray it, Saliva Doolittle. You've made yourself clear. You don't want me to see him, so I'll leave him alone. I want you, Finny. I wanna run my hands through your hair from ears to ass. What--what made you change your mind? Nothing specific. Certainly not a desire to stick it to anyone, if that's what you're implying. Let's make love. It's gonna be beautiful. - I'm gonna hoist you up on that light fixture-- - Oh, can you grab hold of it? - I sure can, yeah. What's up, Will? Hey, smudge. I know, I know. I'm not even dressed for a court appearance. Look at you. I've been trying to bring back the bob for years. Wow. What did you do? Well, after I left here the other night, I thought a lot about what you said. Actually, not right after. Uh, first I stopped off at the Korean deli to get some bourbon and crackers. Luckily, they took Will's Sears card. Anyway, when I woke up the next morning in the cashier's apartment, I thought-- Maybe Grace is right. Maybe my life is out of control. So, I got myself a job. And I found a place to live. You know, Janet, I cannot tell you how many times anonymous sex has led to a career change for me. Yeah. So, where you working? Ann Taylor. Fitting room supervisor. I think I got hired 'cause I was the only one that could see over the doors. "How you doin' in there?" So, you like? Employee discount. No one does fashion on a budget like Ann. Except Lane Bryant, but you know, that's--that's for biggies. - Janet, good for you. - Also, Jones New York. Actually very reasonable. Great separates. But you can build a suit in any of those places. Okay, I want you to stop while you're still a man. Oh, oh! And wait 'til you see my new apartment. Oh, it's so great waking up knowing where I am. Without having to shout out the window, "Hey, what city is this?" Anyway, Smudgy, this is all because of you. You lit a fire under my butt. And--I mean, in a good way, not like when we were kids. And to thank you, I'd like to have you all over for dinner. Janet, I am so proud of you. And even more so, I'm proud of me. I mean, this is-- this is a tribute to you. But even more so, it's a tribute to me. Oh, Karen, that was the best sex I've had in my life. There we are. - What the--!? - Oh, sorry, love. Old habits die hard. No, honey, it's not that. This is half my usual rate. Bloody hell! What is going on? - What the hell are you doing here?! - You told me to be here at exactly 7:00. I did no such thing! Why would I do that if I knew I was gonna be sexing up your father at exactly 7:00? - Lorraine, is it really you? - Hello, Daddy. Good God! Last time I saw you, I was bouncing you on my knee. Yes, I remember. It was my 30th birthday. Aww, nice reunion. Now run along so your daddy and I can make love. Yes, well, before you do that, I think you should know she's only sleeping with you to get back at me. How dare you! Where would you get such an outrageous idea?! From you, ya cow! You invited me here. You sent a car, and you put a bloody great sign in the lobby saying, "Nasty surprise for Lorraine Finster in room 315." - I did not! You're delusional. Throw her out of here! - She's a liar! Throw her out of here! S-s-such a difficult decision. I mean, second only to deciding whether to raise you as a boy or a girl. Keep in touch, okay? But, daddy! I-I'm sorry, Lorraine. I love you, but I'm not in love with you, and I am in love with Karen. What? You are? Yes, and it's--it's never happened to me before. But what about my mummy? Well, I-I wasn't so much in love with mummy as I was in an alley and out of condoms. Fine. You've made your choice. But I can guarantee you'll be sorry. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the Taboo wrap party. They have them every night just in case. Let me give you the tour. This is the living room, slash dining room, slash kitchen, slash bedroom. So, how'd you like the tour? Um, if this is the bathroom too, could everybody turn around? It's--it's right through that door. You might have to jiggle the, uh, thingy. Oh, I always jiggle the thingy. I think she meant on the toilet. The handle on the toilet. Oh, your place is cute. It's quaint, charming, darling. I'm running out of ways to say "small." Hey, it may be small, but her hair is fantastic. God, that's a good bob! You know, I don't mean to toot my own horn, but how many 44-year-olds do you know who have their own apartment and a job? Certainly not your spiritual sisters from the ashram. Who did that Italian mural in there? It's so beautiful. As I was peeing, I did a 360 so I could see the whole thing. Oh, I'm--I'm glad you like it. I just did it to cover up what the previous tenant had. A crude carving that said, "Make it stop." It is beautiful. I like the way you've made the light switch into a-a horny Italian guy. Could you do a mural for me? I really need to freshen up my apartment. Whoever did it, it's just a little dated. I did your apartment. Oh. How awkward for you. - Oh, excuse me, I gotta stick my head in the oven. - Ooh, last time you did that, they had to stick you in a state facility for three weeks. - Would you quit taking shots at your sister? She's doing great. - What are you talking about? I'm very happy for her. - Yeah, well, then act like it. You wanted her normal, she's normal. Well, she's peeling a potato with a Lady Schick, but still. - Karen? - I ran all the way here. I broke my heel tripping over a blind man in an attempt to avoid his dog. Well, w-what happened? I mean, I tell you I love you, and then you don't return my calls. Well, I got kind of freaked out. But no one's ever picked me over their daughter before. Not Jon Voight, not Steven Tyler. Not Goldie Hawn. The thing is I love you too, Finny. Oh, that's wonderful. Come to me. I want to plow you like a Calgary driveway at Christmas. - No, darling, there's more. - No, that will wait. Come to me. I want to land on you like it's a clear day at Heathrow. Save your pretty talk for someone who deserves it. Lorraine was right. I was just shtupping you to shtick it to her. I don't undershtand. I lied to you, Finny. I fell in love with you while I was doing it. But stillI lied. I'm sorry. Do you think you could ever forgive me? - No. - No? I chose you over my daughter, and now you've made a fool of me. And to think I was picturing us together in a cottage in the Cotswolds with a stone fireplace and a rose garden, picking up the occasional townsperson for a three-way. What a beautiful dream. No, no. I-I-I don't want to see you anymore. - But Finny, I-- - Please leave. Good-bye. Mm. Mm. Mm! Janet, tiramisu? Tear-a down my cheek, it's so good. I was gonna say that. Now I have to say something else cute. Oh, I got it. Hewwo. Grace, you must be happy. Tiramisu's your favorite. - Mm-hm, mm-hm. - Well, the whole meal was great. I just want to stop and take a moment and just-- Our hostess, huh? You know, people don't applaud during meals anymore. I miss it. - Guys, come on, you're being too nice. - No, Janet, really, you're being modest. - I mean, you're a woman that got her life together in a week and three days. Aren't you proud of her, Grace? - Mm-hm, mm-hm. - I mean, with the Ann Taylor and the fancy desserts and the artwork in the bathroom-- - You really do have it all, lady. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop clapping for her. The woman made three chicken cutlets and drew a cartoon over the crapper, big whoop. Thank you! Somebody finally said it. I'm sorry, but I can't handle you normal. This is not right, this is not the way it's supposed to be. You are the screw-up older sister. Joyce is the heavy younger sister. And I am the perfect one in the middle. I am the glue that holds you two losers together. - Believe me, Grace, I'm still a loser. - No, you're not! You've got your life together now. No, I don't! It's all an illusion. I'm just a puppet. And he's the one with his hand up my ass! - He made me do it. - Shut up! - What? - Listen, you told me to get my life together. And Will said he could help me do that. All I had to do was listen to everything he said and not ask any stupid questions. He--he made the meal. He got me the job. He gave me this ridiculous haircut. Who has a bob these days? People who want to look good! Uh, Will? I just wanted you to have a normal older sister. That's what you said you wanted, and I wanted to do it for you. Y-y-you've had a tough year. Your husband's away. Your-your hair's kinda "eh". You put on a few pounds, I pretend not to notice. I-- I just wanted to give that to you. So, wait a minute. You-- You both did this for me? - We did. - Yeah, I guess so. Stop that hugging! Everything hasn't been neatly resolved. I have been here all night, and not one person has noticed my right hand ring! I have used this hand to drink, I have used this hand to eat. I even used this hand to jiggle my thingy, and nothing. - Oh, Jack It's beautiful. - Sparkly. So pretty. So, Grace, if it makes you feel any better, I got fired today for being drunk on the job. And then I went out and got drunk 'cause I got fired. - You mean it? - Mm-hm. Oh, this is so wonderful. I hope Joyce is stress-eating right now. Rosie, I'm glad you're home. You got a minute? I'm a little down. See, the guy I'm in love with-- Well, it turns out he don't love me no mo'. But you know what? I'm not gonna give up. No, I'm not. Because when you meet someone that you feel that deep connection with, you must do everything in your power to-- And the bitch hung up on me.   
                




                    			This dinner is delicious. And I love that it's all finger food. Grace, just 'cause you eat half a chicken like it's an apple doesn't make it finger food. I'm cute. Ooh. You know how I love to talk about food I'm going to eat while I'm already eating food? We do. Okay, check it out. A great new noodle shop opened across from my office. Happy Noodles. You know, with all the ugliness in the world, a good noodle shop just seems to be God's way of saying everything's gonna be okay. I believe that's from the book of "noodlerami." This menu rocks! Every dish is more incredible than the last. Should I take the uppers down a notch, or do I actually care about noodles? You know, Will, since we're pairing off, what are we gonna do tomorrow night? Well, I was gonna go to this art opening. Ooh, that sounds great. I'd love to join you. It's not a person named "Art," you understand? Yes, I know. But there's always a lot of rich, old gay guys at those things looking for younger gay guys to take care of. You know, the way Dick Cheney takes care of George Bush. Fascinating. It says his influences are Dali, Cezanne, and Monet. Yikes! Look at the price. Hello, "Dali." That's a lot of "Monet." Yeah, why don't you type that up and send it in to Smarty's Digest? -Could you at least pretend to be interested in the arts? -I am distracted! This place is chock-a-block with rich, old gay guys ripe for the pickin'. Ooh, an 80-year-old in an ascot. Wish me luck. Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna Nicole, you're so outrageous I saw that. But don't worry. I put a mushroom cap in that hat earlier. I'm sorry, it's just-- Women in big hats tap a hidden rage in me. You know what makes me mad? Squirrels in Central Park that make eye contact. Very unsettling. You know, you-- You have almost perfect features. Actually, only yesterday, I gave your lips to a young lady for her sweet sixteen. And your cheekbones to a Doobie Brother. Ah, you're either a plastic surgeon, or I'm Mr. Potatohead. -Will, Will Truman. -I'm Alan Mills. -What is it you do, Will? -I'm a lawyer. Please. You must have passed the bar at 12. Stop it, I-- I don't look that young. Although when the judge calls a recess, I instinctively grab my juice box and run for the monkey bars. Of course, the war brought us out of the depression. Mm, yeah. Depression's rough. Yeah. You know what pulls me out of it? New shoes. New anything, really. I love when people give me things. If you like it so much, why don't you buy it? Oh, no, no, no. It's a little out of my range. If I'm gonna spend a ridiculous amount of money, I want it to be for something practical, you know, like a-- like a sweater. Please, if people were practical, my only patients would be the occasional burn victim. We're out of champagne. I still have shrapnel in my spine. Oh, Bertram, you're killing me. You're funny, you're smart. I just want to pick you up, put you on my hand, and make a wish. Yeah, yeah! Can I have your watch? Congratulations, Mr. Truman. You can pick this up after the show. Well, no-- no, you made a mistake. I--I didn't buy that. That's right, I bought it for you. Oh, oh, no. No, Alan, I can't-- I can't take that. Please, take it, darling, I'm rich. And it gives me pleasure to see people who appreciate art. Well, I-- I don't know what to say. Thank you. You know, there's another opening tomorrow night at the Locus Gallery. Why don't we meet out front, say 7:30? -That sounds nice, but I--I think-- -Of course. We have to eat first. Make it 6:00 at the Mercer Kitchen. Well, sure. Ah, but-- But dinner's on me. We'll see. I'm in! Bertram asked for my number. And to remind him where he was. That guy just bought me this painting. What?! I want a painting. I want something. Jack, you said you didn't have a watch. Yes. It's 9:30. I'll call you tomorrow. Honey, these noodles are terrif'. And that's a big compliment coming from me. I'm Asian. They're amazing, aren't they? I just want to strip naked and writhe around in a giant take-out container full of them. And I guess I'm done. Well, here is your Happy take-out order. Yay, I'm so excited. I can't wait 'til I'm hungry again. You know, Happy noodles really do make me ha-- Ow! -Oh, no, my beautiful noodles. -Grace, please! The girl will do anything to get a peek at my pie. Don't worry miss, uh, we will take care of it. I am so, so sorry. I didn't know that they were gonna be that hot. I guess I'm gonna need another order. Absolutely. That's $7.95. I shouldn't have to pay for that. It's replacement noodles. You order noodles, you have to pay. Are you kiddin' me? This was totally your fault. Everyone knows, if someone brings you something hot, they're supposed to say, "hot plate, hot plate." And the top wasn't put on properly. You're supposed to go-- "Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch" -- All the way around. But you, you were like, "Ch-ch-ch -- I'm tired." $7.95. You know what? You just made the biggest mistake of your life, my friend. Big mistake. I am not someone that you want to trifle with. You don't want to trifle with her. You are gonna rue the day that you ever messed with Grace Adler. Grace Adler is a mess. I know a lot of noodle lovers. And when I tell them what happened at Happy Noodle, they're gonna snub you hard and walk the extra ten feet to Lucky Noodle. Good-bye. You hear that? She's bi. So, Ellen, swear that you will never eat at Happy Noodles again. Swear on your mother's life. Oh, when did that happen? Oh, sorry. Okay. Anyway, don't eat there. Honey, why? Why do you care about this so much? Because at some point in your life, you've gotta start caring about something. And I'm starting with this. I know that it seems small compared to homelessness, and the war in Zazamzia But Still, evil exists when good men do nothing. About noodles. Hey. Sorry I'm late. I had to walk Bertram home from our date. That's right. Walk. My millionaire believes in being thrifty. I tell ya, if there was a step he took that didn't have a fart after it, I didn't hear it. It sounds like this woman in my office. Boy, can she let 'em rip! Pew. Stinky. Um, so where's Will? I thought we were all supposed to have dinner together. He's probably out with Alan. Ugh. Those two are meant for each other. Alan's got a fortune, and Will's got four chins. Who's Alan? I don't know this Alan. Will bagged himself a rich, old dude. Yep, our Will's a trophy boy. Meanwhile, all I got was this bus schedule and you do not want to know what I had to do to get this. You are crazy. Will would never go out with someone just because they're rich and they could buy him things. Guys, guess what? Alan just bought me a horse! Alan, these are-- These are my friends. This is Jack, Karen, and Grace. Hi, nice to meet you. A pleasure. Wait 'til you see the cowboy hat. Will thinks he can't wear it with the new bathing suit, but when he puts on that bolo tie, it just pulls the whole outfit together. Try it on, Will, let's see what they think. All I did was say that I liked Stetson cologne, the next thing I know, I've got a hat and a horse. Yeah? -Wow. -Yeah? It takes me back to the old west. The old West Village. Yeah. Howdy, domestic pardner. Oop, sorry, gotta run. I've gotta give the local traffic girl the ass of the local weather girl. Nice to meet you all. Uh, Will, I snuck a little something into the Gucci bag. -It better not have been-- -It might have been. -You-- Geez. Oh, God, I don't believe it! Leather pants! Oh, Alan, you did not! I'd have never gone to Hermes if I thought he was gonna buy me everything I pointed to. What? You've got a sugar daddy! What?! This is so unfair! I would do a sugar daddy for a horse. Hell, I'd do a horse for a sugar daddy! I do not have a sugar daddy. I resent the implication. There is nothing going on here. I happen to have a wealthy, older friend who--who likes to be in the dressing room when I happen to be trying on swimsuits. Oh, my God, I have a sugar daddy! Don't eat here. The noodles are hot and they charge for them. Okay, don't eat here. The noodles are hot and they charge for them. I don't see the problem. Look, I don't have time to tell you the whole story. It's on the flyer. Okay, I'll read it while I eat my noodles. Thanks, I appreciate Hey! Hey, you can't do that in here. Well, it's cold outside. Look, you're gonna have to leave. Fine, but this isn't over. I've got friends, you know, friends who love cheap Asian food with unisex bathrooms. -And every single one of them has sworn a solemn oath not to eat here until some serious changes are-- -Honey, I need some more hoisin sauce. And could you top off my Sprite? What the hell are you doing here?! Stay perfectly still. Karen, just because you're not moving doesn't mean I can't see you! Honey, calm down. So I slipped once. Here you go, Karen. And since you've been here every day this week, this one is on the house. And, oh, be very, very careful. Hot plate, hot plate. C'mon, Karen, I'll be lady and you be the tramp. This isn't about noodles. This is about supporting your friends. And if it's important to me, it should be important to you. Shame on you. Whew. Somebody needs to get laid. Uh, Alan, I-- I want to talk to you. First, I have a little something for you. -See, that's what I want to talk about. -What, I can't hear you when the lid is on. Alan-- Chanel Apres ski boots? Shut up! I've always wanted these and never, ever needed them. Well, you'll need them now for our little ski vacation in the Swiss Alps. And don't bother packing, I've got everything you need. Whee! No! No. No, I can't. Look, I, uh-- I really appreciate all the gifts, Alan. And--and everything, but I-- I think you may have the wrong idea about our relationship. And what would that be? Well, I don't know. You give me all this stuff. Maybe you're expecting something in return. Something? Something more than a handshake. A hug? A hug with friction. You think I'm trying to get you into bed? Well, Alan, come on. You-- You're a wealthy, older gentleman who appreciates art, and-- And you said yourself, I resemble Michaelangelo's David. If David was on a strict, low-carb diet. I also appreciate Sumerian urns, but I never tried to hump one. Will, I think of you as a friend. I happen to be very generous with my friends. If that confused you, I'm sorry. Alan, I'm so embarrassed. You know what? I think we're done here. You can let yourself out. And leave the boots. Is that vodka? Unbelievable. Oh, are we drinking? I'll join you. Don't bother. I only drink with my friends. Oh, come on, honey, I couldn't stay away. Those noodles are so good. But that is just the point. Don't you get it? This is about taking a stand. And the only stands that are worth taking are the ones that really cost you. You think this boycott's been easy on me? Not a day goes by that I don't think about a big bowl of buckwheat noodles. wimming in a savory broth, with just a few small pieces of tempura gently floating on the top. Or one of those round pieces of pork that the edges are still red, and then you--and then you take the little shaker with--with red pepper, I think it is-- and you sprinkle it very, very lightly on-- Oh, the boycott's over. I'm starving, let's go. I hope Alan's here. I want to apologize to him. II really blew it. I thought you said nothing happened. Ha-Ha! Wak, wak, wak! What happened with you and Bertram? Did you get that subway map you had your eyes on? We broke up. He wouldn't come out to his mom. Hey, there's Alan. I'm gonna go talk to him. I hope we can get back what we had, you know, a relationship of equals. Where one of the equals never has to bring a wallet. Interesting. You know, I think I did that in snow once. Hello, Will. You know, I thought of you just today. I sent off a contribution to the Howard Dean campaign. I hope he didn't take it the wrong way. Okay, I deserved that. Look, I misjudged you and-- and I'm so embarrassed that I went to such a cynical place. Oh, thanks, honey. It-it's just-- I-I've never-- Hi. I-I've never-- I've never had a friendship with someone like you before, and it's not just the age thing, it's--it's-- Okay, what's going on here? That is my outfit. Was Heh. And Sebastian fills it out so much better. I'm curvy where it counts. So, he's-- He's what? My replacement? Ohreplacement's such an ugly word. True, but ugly. Face it, you're getting to be a little long in the tooth for a boy toy. I am not! I could totally be a boy toy. You keep telling yourself that, grandpa. Hey, hey, hey There are plenty of people who would buy me. You know, and-and-- and it wouldn't take any Chanel Apres ski boots either. There isn't a single old guy here who couldn't have me for a lot less! What a proud moment for you. Come on, Sebastian, let's get you tanned Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. I'm 29. I'll bounce back. When did this happen? When did I get too old to be a boy toy? Oh, Will. About ten years ago. But look at the bright side. You're now the older man with money. You can actually have a boy toy. Yeah, right, like-- That is kind of cool. -I could make some hot young guy my plaything. -Oh, no, thank you, I think we're better off as friends. -You're sure? I'd get you a metro card to go with that bus schedule. -Ew, no. Get away from me. What would you do for a Sunday paper?   
                




                    			These wedding announcements have become so confusing since they started letting same-sex couples in. Like, look at that. Is that two gay men or two lesbians? I think it's just an unattractive straight couple. Well, it's just wrong. I firmly believe marriage should be a contract between two cute people. Good luck gettin' that through. Hey! How was your date last night? Aww, bobsled brownie. No second date. Yes, second scoop. What? It was fine. Will. You're eating a bobsled brownie. Clearly your date ran from you. And now you're drowning your sorrows in well-priced ice cream. Will, how many times do I have to tell you that a bobsled brownie is not gonna fill the hole where a boyfriend should be? Oh, wait. It was a nightmare. He met someone else during the movie! Well, I'm glad you're a mess. I need to ask you a favor. Remember Leo? You mean the man you tricked into marrying you? And then he fled the country? Yeah, my husband. Well, he's got this cabin up in Vermont, and the stupid pipes froze. One of his neighbors called. And it's like they expect me to go up there and take care of it. Why would I do that? Sometimes married people do things for each other, even when they don't want to. Why am I hearing about this for the first time now? Will you come with me? I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass. Why? What have you got going on, Bobsled Brownie? I have to meet with a new client. The only reason the firm assigned him to me is 'cause he's gay. Like I'm the only one who can speak his language. How insulting. - So he wasn't that cute? - Not to me. And I was hoping. Jack, will you come up with me? Oh, I'm sorry, Grace. I can't. I'm gonna go see The Boy From Oz. Yeah, I can't wait to see Hugh Jackman and his huge ackman. Pun: Copyright, Jack McFarland. Great. So what am I supposed to do? Go up there by myself like an animal? You could always drug someone and take them up there with you. Hey, why don't you take Karen? That--that way you just have to take her up there with you. Will, hi. Your 11:00 a.m. is here. And I'm here too if you need me. Not just work. Anything, I'm flexible and limber. Good to know. Even on a weekend or Christmas. Do you have plans next Christmas? - Of course you do. Look at you. - All right, come on. Mr. LaMarak, hi. - Hi. - Nice to see you again. I know you're a busy man, so-- - Will, have you seen The Lord of the Rings? - Uh, yeah. I'm talking, like, all three pictures. I don't want to screw around with some guy who just showed up for the last one. No, I was there the first day they came out. Then again, I'll go to see any movie where boys named Merry and Pippin risk their lives for a good piece of jewelry. Thank God. The last firm I was with, they hadn't seen any of them. I mean, I had nothing to talk to them about. I had to leave. Is that weird? Not at all. No, I once changed dry-cleaners because they put a plant in front of the autographed picture of Patrick Swayze. Well, I've had this opportunity to go through your history. It's really quite inspiring. The guy who invented stuff in his garage to the CEO of Stuff I Invented in my Garage Industries. And through it all, you never sold out. So what is it you want to do now? - Sell out. - Pardon? Yeah, I want to sell it. I want to sell it all. Don't want to invent stuff no mo'. Just wanna sit back and count my monies. My precious. See, you got that 'cause you saw it. Please, saw it? When Théoden's daughter, Éowyn, took off her helmet, I screamed like an Uruk-hai. Look, I like the movie, but I'm not a freak, okay? - Will, clear your desk, 'cause I got a case for you. It's gonna be the trial of the century. Hi. - Hi. I went to go see the matinee of The Boy from Oz. And halfway through the second act, I saw a Hugh Jackman do this That's my move. We're gonna sue! It's Jack v. Jackman. I like it. Good title. I'm gonna wear a veil and be my own surprise witness. Well, you certainly have a lot of veils. - Here's our strategy. You leave right now, and I'll slam the door. - Slam it all the way to the bank! Sorry about that. He's a little hard to control. He's product of a broken disco. Who is he? Oh, he's my, um What's the best way to describe Jack? Foxy, vivacious, heaven in blue jeans, and please don't leave out single? - You're kidding. - No, I want you to set us up. I want him to be the lord of my ring. Whew. Something about this fresh air. It's so relaxing. I think I may have nodded off for a few minutes on the drive up. Nodded off? You took a fistful of downers with a bottle of Pino Grigio, and you're out cold for three hours. I had to stop every 30 miles to pull your tongue out of the back of your throat. Yeah, well, I used to read in the car, but it made me nauseous. I don't know about Vermont. It makes me a bit uncomfortable in a state where you drive by 20 churches and not one temple. Okay, grab the key. Leo said it would be under the mat. Why me? 'Cause you're closer to the floor, Shorty. Oh, here it is. Okay, all right, let's get inside. This place gives me the creeps. It's like something out of a horror movie. Promise me, whatever we do, we're not gonna lose our virginity or go skinny-dipping at midnight. I can't make that promise. Honey, look. What an adorable little cabin. You know, my ex-boyfriend used to have a place like this. Huh, I wonder whatever happened to Teddy Kaczynski. We lost touch. Which is funny 'cause he was such a good letter writer. Oh, look at this place. It's so Leo. Look, canoe paddles. The mounted fish. A picture of me. Oh, God I'm pretty. Oh, look. Commemorative inaugural plates. Eww, who would want to eat off of Nancy Reagan? I think a lot of people. She's a very clean lady. Now, that Lady Bird Johnson. Ho, stranger to the bathtub. - God, it's freezing in here. - I know. I can see my breath. So can I, and it says Smirnoff on it. All right, the plumber can't be here till the morning, so what do you wanna do about dinner? Well, you may not know this about me, but I do have a bit of a flair for the outdoors. If you'd like, I could rustle us up some grub. Karen, you know I'm against hunting. Oh, Honey, me too. But I saw a rib joint a few miles back, and there's only one guy covering the register. Karen, wait! See if they have cornbread. Hey. I just got your message. You needed to see my ass and pee? I needed to see you A.S.A.P. Look, um I'm a little uncomfortable asking you this, but you remember the guy that was in my office today? He really wants to go out with you. Hmm, your office. Guy in your office. Interesting. You mean you. No, Jack, not me. All right, well Okay, I see. Let's just call him Will Fruman, okay? I think Will Fruman is darling and kind with a permanent frown and anger lines that go on for days. But please tell Mr. Fruman I'm gonna have to decline. I'll pass it on through his idiot friend Hack McGarland. I'm talking about my client, Stuart. Remember? You said hi. He said hi back. You two really seemed to get each other. No, thanks. I'm done with men. who walk like men. Men are hot. I miss men. I'm back on men. - So you'll go out with him. - No. Come on, Jack. This is a really big client. And I need to score points with the firm. I've been still trying to make up for mismanaging the office potluck. Like I don't hate myself enough for having two ambrosia salads. Come on, please do this. Willicent Truman! Are you trying to pimp me? Like some common tramp trolling the docks? Well, I'm here to tell you, there ain't enough money in the world that would make me your ho. I'll give you this old ChapStick and all the coins in my pocket. Buy a lady a drink, sailor? Okay, I'll set something up for Saturday. That way you'll have enough time to get off sugar and get on Ritalin. Wait, Saturday. Um, then who's gonnaover the pre-theater dier rush over at Café Jacques'? You mean your one tiny table in the hallway? I'll do it. All right, I'll go out with him. But I'm gonna need that ChapStick up front. Well, I chopped a cord of firewood and tapped a couple of trees, so we've got syrup for the morning. Brrr, cold winter. Good thing summer fell on the weekend. This would've disturbed me more, if I hadn't just seen you whittle a martini glass out of a pine cone. Oh, Honey, look at you. I never thought I'd see you in your wedding dress again. Karen, it's Leo's nightshirt. I found it in the hamper. The weird thing is it fits. I think I've gained a little weight. Hey, I'm still 50 pounds lighter than every other woman we drove past. Honey, you got that out of the hamper? Do you know what that shirt's been through? A man wearing a flannel nightshirt doesn't have a chance in hell of getting touched by anyone but himself. What? I like it. It even smells like him. All woodsy and other hamper smells. It makes me feel safe, like he's here with me. Yeah, well, keep that thing away from me. I don't want to itch from anything but my own medications. Okay, I guess since there's no TV, I'll just go to bed. Or maybe I'll take advantage of this time and curl up with a good book. Eh, good night. One bed, huh? I must say, you've orchestrated this perfectly, Grace. This is kind of fun. You know what I love about the woods? How you can just go to bed without brushing your teeth. You like that about Manhattan too, don't you? - Well, good night. - Good night. This bed is awful. God, it's so lumpy. Yeah. It is, Honey, but it's not the mattress. No, there's money under here. - What? - Yeah. 10, 20, 30. There's at least $42,500 and one roll of quarters. - What? I can't believe this. - I know, right? Whoo. - What is Leo doing with all this money, and why is he hiding it from me? - I don't know, Honey. This is-- Okay, no--no reason to get all crazy. This is Leo. I'm sure there's a perfectly good explanation. Of course there is. It's Leo. Like what? - Well, there has to be a thousand possible reasons. - Thousands! Pick your favorite. Well, I'm sure that he just-- He's--he's probably-- Okay, fine. I can't think of any. My husband doesn't trust me. That's what this is about. Nice. Well, I'll tell you something. This is my money as much as it is his. And I'm gonna go out, and I'm gonna spend my half. Yeah. That'll teach him not to trust you. - That's right. First thing in the morning, we're hitting the outlets. Good night. - Good night. - Honey, no kiss? - Oh, sorry. - Hey, how was the date? - First things first. How's was the dinner rush at Jacques'? Slow for most of the night, and then a party of unicorns came in. Sowhat was the date like? Oh, it was great. Good conversation. A freewheeling exchange of ideas. Really? And where were you during all of this? Thank you, you really helped me. - Oh, Jack. Hi, did you get the flowers ? - I did. And they were beautiful. I sent them back for the cash. I hope that's okay. - That's more than okay. That's adorable. - Oh, you are. - You are. - You are! - You! This must be an example of the sparkling conversation you were making. Uh, Jack, nice to see you. But, uh, Stuart and I have a meeting. Oh, Will, I was thinking maybe Jack could stay. You see, he makes me feel good about a man I like to call me. Fine, sit down. Let's get started. - And, Jack - Don't worry about me. I'll be quiet as a mouse. Hmm, cheddar. Heh-heh. - Okay, on the sale of your company, I've had proposals from several interested parties. - Pss-pss-psst. Excuse me. - Yes? - I'm sorry. Um, could you bring me up to speed? What exactly are we talking about here? I just heard the word "sale" and "company." Stuart is selling his company. Yeah, I would not have gotten that. - Sad. - What, Kitten Fish? You don't think I should sell? Well, you love that company. You worked your whole life for that company. As a matter a fact, I think that's where you were working when we met. I can't believe you still remember that. Will, can you believe this? Yes, I can. Because it was yesterday. Okay, I think the clear frontrunner is this office products company out of Dallas. They're making a cash for stock offer. And they'll retain you as a consultant. All right, well, this looks good. What? It's just-- I don't like Dallas. Isn't there a company in, say-- I don't know, Knots Landing -- that would be willing to buy. You heard him. Dallas is out of the question. What else you got? Seriously? I guess I'll have to cancel our proposed acquisition of Falcon Crest Vineyards. Okay, smells like we're done here. All right, hey, let's go to Outback Steakhouse. Jack! We are trying to do business here. Now, why don't you go down the hall to the coffee room and run around in a circle? Like it or not, Jack is a part of this decision-making process. Why? Uh, because he's my boyfriend. Boyfriend?! You went out on one date. Look, you may not approve of our lifestyle. - But Jack and I are a team. And if you've got a problem with that, then maybe we should find other representation. - Oh, please! He only when out with you 'cause I paid him to! - What? - Yes! I gave him ChapStick and a handful of change. Jack. How much change? I have to go. Wait, I'll-- I'll go to Dallas. I'll go to any nighttime soap you want. Oh-ho. I always wondered what it would be like to spend $3,000 on apple butter. Thank you, Leo. Honey, you really cleaned up that Japanese silverware store. What are you gonna do with all those spoons? Eat the $15,000 worth of Ben & Jerry's we bought at the factory. It's a good thing we don't need a freezer. The whole state is a freezer. So, Honey, are you feeling any better? Well, I don't know, Karen. I think this may be one of those weird problems that spending money can't fix. What you talkin' about, Willis? You just need to spend more. Come on, let's go buy that historic church and turn it into a gay bar. Come on. Karen, no matter how much money I spend, I'm still gonna be left with the same problem. My husband keeps secrets from me. He has this whole other life. It's like I don't even know the person who lives here. What are you doing in our house? Honey, look, Leo's here. And he brought a date. No. No, this is Leo Marcus' cabin. Why else would he have my picture on the mantel? That's Rita Hayworth. - Well, a lot of people make that mistake. - Leo lives next-door. Who are you? Oh. I'm his wife. Oh, my God, so, so that was your money under the mattress. How do you know about that? That's our life savings! Yes, it was. And now it's defrosting on the front lawn. - What? - Okay. Silver-lining time, folks. Yes, yes, I broke into your cabin and spent all your money. But the good news is, is my husband isn't keeping secrets from me. Our marriage is secure. Isn't that wonderful news ? John, get the gun. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on. Calm down. Use mine. Hey. Hey. Just cleaning. Yeah. Heard from Stuart? He won't take my calls. I'm sorry, Jack. I didn't mean to blurt that out. I know, and I didn't mean to be a jerk in the meeting. I get carried away when I'm included. - But you're gonna be okay, right? It really was just one date. - Yeah, I'll be fine. It's no big deal. - I was just going out with him for you. - That's right. A bobsled brownie. Oh, my God. You really do like him. How much do I have to eat before the pain goes away? A lot. Honey, that was fun. What misadventures are we going to get into next? One thing's for sure. Whenever we're together, wackiness ensues. Yeah, maybe. What's up, Honey? You seem a little blue. I'm worried. But there's nothing to worry about. That wasn't Leo's cabin. It wasn't his money. It wasn't his nightshirt. Eww, that wasn't his nightshirt. I just hate that I went to such a crazy place. It's just that if Leo were here, I could've talked to him about it. And I wouldn't have spun out of control. But he's not here. Yeah, but I am, Honey. And I know what it feels like to have your man be far away. Ever since Stan died, I barely see him anymore. And sometimes, Honey-- Can you keep a secret? You're sweet to me, Karen. - Thanks for coming up here with me. - Come on. This is the least I can do. - Karen? - Sorry, something about Vermont. I don't know. Congratulations. You have just sold your company. I'm sure you and all that money are going to be very happy together. Yeah. Well, you can't cuddle money, Will. Well, you can. It just doesn't cuddle back. That's the spirit. Could you sign again? There's a tear on the second T. Now that you've done this, um, there's another acquisition I think you should have a look at. It's about 30 years old. It's not without it's problems. It's expensive. Very high-maintenance. But I think it's gonna pay dividends for many years to come. What are you talking about? I don't know. Come on, Stuart. Yes, Will made me go out with you. Yes, I did it for all the wrong reasons. Yes, I had no feelings whatsoever when I went into this. Let's get past the yes section. But during the four hours we spent together, something happened. I fell for you, Stuart. Stuart Little. - I think what Jack is trying to say-- - Keep out of this, Miss Match! Anyway, I understand if you don't want to forgive me. I-I just wanted to let you know how much I care about you. Now I'll leave you alone forever. Out of my way! Will, stop him! He's getting so far away! Jack, stop! Jack, no one has ever done anything that romantic for me before. And in front of all these people. So you'll forgive me? Yes. I've always dreamed of two men holding each other tenderly in my office. I just always hoped one of them would be me. If you need me, I'll be at Baskin-Robbins. Honey, is it okay if I nod off for a little while? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Thanks, good night. - What, no kiss? - Oh, sorry.   
                




                    			Excellent dinner, Will. I'd help with the dishes, but I'm riveted by this week's In Touch. You mean the B-version of People Cheaple. There's this article on Mandy Moore and Andy Roddick I'm dying to finish. I've only gotten through one half of the quarter page. I don't know. I think actresses and tennis players are a bad match. When Agassi was with Brooke Shields, his hair fell out and her show stayed on the air. It's so cool how Mandy and Andy met. She said that he was cute, and then his mom called her publicist. I want someone's mom to call my publicist. Guys, is this really what it's come to? All we have to talk about are the lives of celebrities? Yeah, it's fun. Get on board. Mandy and Andy. No, Grace has a point. I mean, our lives are just as interesting as those of famous people, like mine, for example. I'm taking a cooking class. Don't say it like it's small and pathetic. I think it's important. I didn't say it like it was small and pathetic. I kind of said it like it was a big thing. I'm taking it with Larry. - Oh, can I come too? - Sure. See what's going on? We don't need celebrities. We're talking. We're sharing. Things are happening. So, Jack, why the class? Why cooking? Why now? Well, I don't want to be one of those people that always talks about their boyfriend. But now that I have a boyfriend, I wanted to cook my boyfriend a home-cooked meal. Boyfriend! So, Karen, what's going on in your life? What's going on? Ugh, how much time do you got? My mother moved back to town-- Hmm, that didn't take as much time as I thought. Karen, if that computer's on, I'm going to be really alarmed. Kiki! - Mama! - Aw, honey. Grace, Grace. Aw, look at you. You look fantastic. Have you lost weight? Uh, no, actually, I've gained a little. Well, obviously I can see that, but it's rude to say it, isn't it? Hey, what are you doing here? I thought we were meeting up later in the morning for pancakes and beer? Well, you know, I was working on the apartment. And I just--I got so depressed. I mean, it needs so much work. I think I'm gonna need a professional. Mama, you're in luck. Grace is a designer. Yes. She's got a great eye for color. She's good with clients. And she does amazing things with fabric. God, Karen, you're so sweet. But you better have a lot of money in the budget for Egg McMuffins, because Heavy G like to eat. So what do you think? Can you help me out? Well, I do have some time. I've been working on a bedroom for this Westchester housewife, but I can't really do anything until her stripper pole arrives, so - So what kind of budget are we talking about? - Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my mother you're talking about. Nobody puts my Linda on a budget. - Lois. - Yes? Look, Karen, you have helped me out before, but I want to do this on my own. Now, listen, Grace, I've got $1,400 to do five rooms. What can you do for me? Before I answer that, could I just say how much I admired your old relationship, you know, the one where money was no object. Let's take another look at that. Now, Grace, the fact that my mama wants to do this without my help gives me a beautiful feeling. So does the pill that you take every 15 minutes labeled "beautiful feeling." So pop another one and give me some more cash. Come on, Grace, please. This is important to us. Please. How can I resist those sad dilated pupils? Oh, do we have an early bird? You're here for the class? Yes, I'm, uh, I'm Will Truman. You know, my mom has every single one of your cookbooks. Would you mind signing one for her? Her name's also Will. Okay. Absolutely. Now, please, don't be self conscious around my prosthetic finger. - Oh, I thought it was a real finger. - Oh, well, it's not. I believed you before you bit it. Don't worry. I didn't lose it in a cooking incident. It was shot off in our parking lot. - Oh! Are you here on your own? - Oh, no, no, no. I'm meeting some friends. Kind of a guys' night out. And when we're together, we get a little crazy. So watch out. But not messy crazy. You know, more like tidy crazy. Oh, welcome, welcome. Grab an apron. And, gentlemen, do not be afraid that an apron will make you look girly. Although sometimes it does. - Oh, sorry, I brought my own. - Oh, my. You don't see embroidery like that anymore. Thank you. It's just a basic McCall's pattern. But I kind of put my own stink on it with the embroidery. I was something of a stitching prodigy in my--in my early teens. And, uh, in case it wasn't clear, I'm gay. - Oh, Don, he's gay. We should introduce him to your brother. - My brother's not gay. He's a workaholic. - Hey, Will. - Hey. - Love the apron. McCall's? - Yeah. Joe, you came. I thought it was just gonna be Larry. Well, we're kind of in a love phase. The seven-year itch sort of scabbed over and fell off. Now we can't be apart. My husband, the poet, huh? Okay, everybody. Wash your hands. I do before every class. Once a week I throw the fake one in the dishwasher. Will, the sweetest thing just happened. The lady on the elevator said we were a cute couple. Well, actually she said, "Stop making out or the fires of hell will consume you." That's just an expression. Like "we don't want your kind in our neighborhood" or "there he is, get him." So you--you brought Stuart. Well, yeah, he's my boyfriend. Joe and Larry, my boyfriend Stuart. Boyfriend Stuart, Joe and Larry. Boyfriend, boyfriend, boyfriend. - Wow, everyone's gay. Your brother and his roommate should take this class. - He has a roommate because he's a workaholic. Okay. Before we get started, why don't we all go around and introduce ourselves. Please, please. Okay. We're Don and Debbie. I'm Debbie. We love to cook. We're big grillers. Oh, well, we're Joe and Larry. And we just celebrated our 15th anniversary. And, well, we have a five-year-old. Adopted. I didn't want to lose my figure. Oh, we are Jack and Stuart. I'm a pretty stewardess from Omaha, Nebraska. And this is a businessman I met on a nonstop flight to Sexyville. I don't want to get all John Wayne on your asses, but, pardner, this one's a keeper. We'reWill. Uh, this is my apron. If you count the blackbirds, you'll note there are 4 and 20. Okay, all the recipes that we are going to be making tonight serve two. But you can double the recipe if you're having another couple over for dinner. Or, Will, in your case, cut them in half. - You know, uh, I'm not always alone. - That's right. His mother was living with him until recently. Do not go in there. Oh, honey, again? See a doctor. No. I just sanded the walls and it's all dusty. I must have peeled up all that awful linoleum. Good news, underneath all that awful linoleum, awful tile. - What are you doing? - You told me to paint. I'm on my second coat. Not your nails. The walls. Not with nail polish. With paint. Not with that brush! A big brush! God, honey, stop yelling at me. You're making me feel incompetent. Karen, I need help. I can't afford to hire real workers. So you and I, we've gotta do it ourselves. Unless you want to slip me a little more cash. Come on. No one has to know. Get over it, Grace. You're not getting any more money. That's the way my mom wants it. Besides, I've done my fair share. I hired a burley construction worker to do the heavy lifting. That's it, lady. I'm on lunch. No, really. It's a prosthesis. Look. Nothing. Now when you've heated your pan, we are going to add two tablespoons of butter. Will, for you, that's one. - Four cups of chicken stock. Will, for you, that's two. And a teaspoon of salt-- Will, for you, that's-- - Let me guess, half of it? No, use the whole one. You're on your own. You might as well bloat. Aw, that is just so, so sad. Look, Jack, will you promise me something? If in a year, Will is still alone, we'll have him put down? Thank God for you, Joe. - I know we can be bitchy to each other-- well, more you to me-- but when I look at Will - Yeah, and, to think, I was so much more into him than you for awhile. Me too! What happened to him? You know I can hear you? You're looking at me when you say it. Look, how many times do I have to tell you, I'm fine being alone. I even prefer it. You know, I'm here to learn about cooking. I don't have to be paired up with someone to-- - Sorry, am I too late to be in this class? - Not at all! Free spot right here! Let me get you up to speed. She's got a fake finger, and I'm single. Now, lower the flame, uncover the lids, and we'll see how our ratatouille turned out. - You're an amazing cook. You know that? - Adam, I am not. No, the way you chop that egg plant, it was really sexy. Would it be too intimate if I fed you? Would it be too intimate if I cried while you did it? Just be careful you don't get any on the apron. Why do you keep looking at the new guy? Do you think he's sexier than I am? Of course not. Come here. This is a lot of fun. You know, she also teaches a master class in baking. We should take that. Oh, yeah, then we could be master bakers. We could master bake together. Maybe my brother is gay. Well, what'd you think, Don? The man wears Chinese slippers. Let's hurry up and eat this so we can get out of here. Why? Do you have plans later on? I was hoping I did. Really? Well, um Will, you're gettin' that all over your apron. I don't care! Everybody, switch, because it's a good idea to sample each other's work. Uh, but you may want to sit this out, Debbie. No offense, but I noticed your cold sore. - It's not a cold sor-- - Sit down, Debbie! It's gross. Well, you seem to be having fun, you dog. I know. Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Yeah, that's the sound a dog makes. Anyway, we're, uh, we're just happy to see that you found someone. Jack was saying, if it went on much longer, he's was thinking about buying you a hooker. That's 'cause he has all those gift certificates. No, seriously. He even clipped out an ad from Homo Extra. - Yeah, right, like he'd ever buy me a hooker. Like Jack would ever buy-- - 60, 80, 100. Okay, open your eyes! Oh, Grace. This is gorgeous! I'm amazed that you could do this on such a tight budget. Well, between Ikea, eBay, and Rosario's bedroom, we were able to pull it together. I love it. It's, it's wonderful. And the best part is I finally have a home where my daughter can visit me. Oh, Mama. I feel really good about this. Like, for the first time in your life, you're actually putting me first before the money, the scams, the passing off of horsehair ponytails as human hair. It's a good one, isn't it? I'm proud of you, Mom. You really have changed. And I'm proud of you, Karen. I have never seen you work so hard. I've never seen you work. And I'm proud of you, Grace. Not only has the weight gain made your breasts bigger, - but you've pulled this whole place together with nothing but pluck and the sweat of your brow. - And a lot of toxic glue. You'll be fine, just don't buy a canary. I am never going to leave here. I just love this apartment. So does your neighbor. She was so impressed, she wanted to buy it for something like 100 grand more than you paid for it. No kidding? Oh Excuse me. Wait. Where are you going? Well, I'm gonna take her offer. Get out of this hole and buy a McDonald's in Tokyo. I mean, it's always been my dream. Wait a minute. I busted my hump so you could have a nice home and be closer to your daughter, and now you're just gonna ditch it to make a quick buck? - I'll cut you in for a third. - I'm in. Grace, how could you? You know how important this relationship with my mother is to me, and now you're abandoning me for a lousy third? - I'll give you a third of my third. - Sayonara, Mama-san. Okay. That concludes stews and soups for gay men and the occasional straight couple. I hope you enjoyed it. I'm gonna hand out some of these evaluation forms. Um, I'm supposed to leave the room while you fill them out, but I find I get better results if I stay. So, Will, I hope this isn't out of line, but you up for coming back to my place later? Well, Adam, I hope this isn't out of line, but are you a filthy whore? - What are you talking about? - Oh, please. Let me tell you something. Will Truman doesn't have to pay for it, okay? Will Truman just goes months and months at a time without it and then pours all his sexual energy into his embroidery. Will, what are you doing? I know you paid this guy. Couldn't you have at least gotten somebody halfway respectable instead of this piece of rough trade from Skankville. I'm from Montclair, New Jersey. Get to a clinic, ho! I don't need this. I may be tall, but I still have feelings. - What was that? - Oh, come on, Jack. "60, 80, 100." I saw you pay him. Yeah, for this cute little anklet I got Stuart. Adam makes them to raise money for diabetes awareness. - But Stuart said you were thinking about buying me a prostitute. - Oh, Will, I think about that all the time. So I just let a gorgeous, sweet man who cooks and makes his own jewelry and who was totally into me walk out that door? No, first you called him a filthy, stinkin' ho, told him to get to a clinic, and then he kind of ran out the door. Oh, my God! I promise I'll come back to sponge off my station. Ugh, poor Will. That he would go to that place. Well, what happened to him that he would think that the only way that a guy would be interested in him is if he were being paid? - It's sad. - Yeah. Super sad. That's why I got him the hooker! Well, he was bringing the whole class down, you know. When my husband died, it wasn't soup that comforted me. It was Adam. I think he danced at my bachelorette party. Ours, too! - Hey, Stu, you got any cash? Let's see if we can get him to do anything. - Tons. I mean, her mother had me renovate her entire apartment for, like, no money. And then she turned around and sold it for a huge profit. It just doesn't seem right. - It's immoral. - Deceitful. Unethical. - We should totally do it. - We should. Wait, you would do that with me? Yeah, I think it's genius. I buy the properties. You slap a coat of paint on them. We turn them around for some serious do-re-mi. I hate that Julie Andrews doesn't sing anymore. We'd be in business together again, like when I sold your term papers in college. You sold my term papers? Didn't I cut you in? Eh, it's too late now.   
                




                    			This is crazy. Ten years ago, a three-bedroom in Chelsea would be half this price. I know. And a two-bedroom in Clinton has nearly tripled in value. But, oddly, Chelsea Clinton has gotten slimmer. As an uninterested observer who looks ravishing in white I have a simple query What's going on? Oh, well, Grace and I are looking to buy a property to flip. You know, we buy it cheap, fix it up cheap, and you resell it for not cheap. We're flippers. Outrageous! I want no part of your ruthless, money-grubbing schemes. You make money. And who loses? The big oil companies and President Bush. I think it's disgusting. Well, sure we make money, but everyone benefits. You know, we'll buy for a fair price. We'll invest our time and our creativity, and we'll flip for an honest profit. That's right. We're the flippers who care. And you know how Ben and Jerry's gives five percent of its profits to charity? Well, we're gonna spend five percent of our profits at Ben and Jerry's. Hey, kids! I got the best news and I couldn't wait to share it with you, because you're last on my list. Lyle Finster and I are back together! Really? Didn't you guys break up? 'Cause the last time we saw the two of you, you were taking advantage of him to get back at his daughter, Lorraine. Meanwhile, you developed real feelings for him in the process, but he no longer cared. Oh, Jackie. I love when you recap. He decided to forgive me. He's back, he's moved in, and we're shagging like two lieutenants after lights out. That's beautiful. It's just like An Officer and a Gentleman, when Richard Gere comes back at the end to get his guy-- Girl. And he carries him-- Her Out of the bath house. Bus Factory Oh, Jackie. I'm in love. And with the sweetest most adorable gal. Guy So, did you have a busy day, darling? Oh, the usual. Putting out fires, starting new ones, pissing in the wind and such. You businessmen and your legalese. It's all so complicated. And now, what about you love? Thank you, Manuel. What have you got planned for today, my darling? Just catching up on my knitting Every Easter for all of the servants, I crochet tiny little bunnies with their salaries on them. Oh, I bet they love that. Yes, they do. And it's a special gift, because it comes from me. Hey! Time to sit is time to knit. Get on it stitch. What a coincidence. One knitting needle for each of your eyes. Oh, darling, what did I ever do to deserve you? I guess, somewhere in my wicked, miserable past, there must have been a moment of truth For here you are, standing there, loving me. Whether or not you should For somewhere in my youth or childhood, I must have done something, something good. something good. Oh, darling, promise me it will always be this way. That we'll always spend our mornings over coffee and enjoying an impromptu song. I promise, though spontaneity makes it harder to incorporate footwear. Ms. Karen. You're gonna lose it. Whaddaya talk? Wild horses couldn't kill this buzz. I wouldn't count on it. Lorraine Finster! You got a lot of nerve coming here! How did you even get in? I would have thought the toothbrush hanging over the door would have scared you away. Oh, that's what that was. What are you doing here? What's it look like I'm doing? Turning tricks for Tootsie Rolls? I was kicked out of my place, so I'm moving in here. Hello, mother! Thanks for walking me, Stuart. The streets are really tough out there for a boy alone Ironically, they're tougher for two boys together. Wow, I'm really impressed you're working with patients already. Oh, though. As a student nurse, I can't technically touch them, treat them, or care for them. But I can look kindly at them and be thankful I'm not them. And that's the best medicine of all. Well, I'll see you tonight. Kiss you then! Good morning! My name is Jack and today we're going to play everybody's favorite game Dead or Alive! Zandra! I'll give you ten bucks to unplug me. Zandra, it's me. Jack McFarland. Remember? I'm your former acting class protégé. I'm a student nurse now. Yeah, I really feel like I found my calling, so don't even try to talk me back into acting. If I start to, you put a finger right into my brain! So, how are you? Are you dying? You looking like you're dying. I'm not dying, jerk. I'm getting out of here today. Oh. So are you going home? No. A slot finally opened up in the Actors' Retirement Village. I waited twenty years and then fortune smiled. Last week, someone was smothered in their sleep. So, are you thinking about selling your old place? What's it to you, chimp? I have the perfect buyers! I'll introduce you to them, and then I'll help you move. I'll be by at eight. Great. Maybe I'll be dead by seven. Oh, Zandra! I wish everybody who died in that bed had your sense of humor. Please, daddy. I have nowhere to go. I've lost everything my job, my apartment. I am naked under this coat. Poor dear. Sit down, sit down. Let us talk about it. May I take your coat? Forget it! I don't want her sticking to my furniture. But, darling, I thought you were doing so well in the chorus of Taboo, the Boy George musical, that you were bunking with Boy George? Well, I was, but because the show closed, he kicked me out. Well, that and he found me in a three-way with Simply Red and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Hit the road, you syphillitic toad. Karen, if there's one thing I will not tolerate, it's rhyming insults. Sow. Cow. Runt. Stop it! Daddy please? The streets are an awfully hard place for a girl like me. Please, can you find it in your heart to take me in? Brava. That's quite a performance, Lady Macbreath. But they ain't nobody buying it Karen, the girl has nowhere to go. I mean, She's my only child. Well, the only pretty one. Let her stay for me. Oh, Finny, you gentle giant. How can I say no to a face like that. All right, fine, she can stay. Super! But she has to drink from the hose and any trick she turns, the house gets thirty percent. That is not fair! The industry standard is fifteen! Fifty years in one apartment. Whew. A lot of memories, huh? I still remember the night that Don Ameche tied me to this radiator with my bra. Hello-oooo? Why do you do that? Why do you put too many O's on your "hello?" I don't know-oooo. Oh, hey you guys. Come on in! Ooh, Jack, you were right. This is great. A lot of potential. Who are you?! Zandra, this is Will and Grace. They're my best friends. Her husband abandoned her. His never existed. Will and Grace, Zandra. Hi. We actually met last year. I, uh, I took one of your classes. You helped me get through to a very honest place, really excavating those layers that kept me buried emotionally. Oh, the crying fag! That's him. Anyway, thank you. Hi. It is such an honor to meet you. We brought you chocolate and flowers. Here are the flowers. Zandra, we would like to make you an offer. An offer? Zandra, now you don't have to be buried in a drawer. Ok, here are my terms. Either you give me two thousand more than what I paid fifty years ago, or there is no deal. Wow. Two thousand whole dollars. Let me just confer with my colleague here. Oh my God! This is a great deal! I can't believe it! No, no wait. Aren't we taking advantage of her? Aren't we the flippers who care? You're right. We should do the right thing. We have to Zandra. Two thousand is way too little. We're gonna give you two thousand two hundred. And a pen. Suckers. I already have a pen. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I brought you guys together. Shouldn't I get ten percent commission? You're absolutely right. And ten percent of two thousand two hundred is two dollars and twenty cents. Wow. This is nice. It feels good, work. Rolling up your sleeves, getting dirty. And how would you know? I sanded, I painted, I brought in all the furniture. All you did was sit on your ass and plow through a bag of Doodles. Hey, I'm an artist. Do you know how many Ho-Ho's Picasso went through when he was painting Guernica? Well, whatever it takes. It's a great design. The place looks amazing. And we are gonna make a fortune! Let's clap on that. Ow! You did it hard! You did it hard! Hey, hey! Lookit here! Zandra! The old dame wanted one last look before cataracts took her sight entirely. Oh, my, this is so pretty. It's just like when I bought it. Look here, this is where Robert Mitchum dry-humped me when we were on dope. Well, another Cold Case file solved. You know what? I've changed my mind. About what? I want my home back! Wait a minute! What about the Actors' Retirement Village? It's so fun there, with all the famous actors, who lost all their money getting swindled by their business managers, and now their only source of amusement is passing gas and pulling the covers over their head? Fun! I hate it. Adam West never locks the bathroom door. You hear that? She can't walk down the hallway without getting a peek at the batpole. Now, come on, give her the place back! No! I'm sorry, but she sold it to us. I thought you were the flippers who care? We still care. If anything, we care more. You're going to that home, lady! You remind me of Lucille Ball. I hated Lucille Ball! You two are really something! Kicking an old woman out her home A place were dozens of dead actors molested her. And for what? Money! I hope you're happy. Let's go, Zandra. You've been screwed in this apartment enough! Morning, darling. Oh. Morning. Coffee magically appeared again today. Would you like some? Oh, love some. Yes. I don't know why I slept so late. The last thing I remember is eating that oatmeal cookie. Rosie puts roofies in them. I hate raisins. Anyway, I'm sorry I passed out. I was looking forward to making love to you. Oh, you did. Ugh. Couldn't you do that somewhere else? People eat in here I don't want to see a sixty-year-old man making out with my father. Lorraine, that is no way to greet Karen. Sorry, daddy. Morning, mother! Lorraine. Could you please tone down that British accent? It makes me nauseous this early in the morning. Darling, I have a British accent. For which I take Dramamine. Muffins? I don't like muffins! I want chocolate pudding for breakfast. Lorraine! These muffins have been specially designed to keep you regular. There are two things I will not tolerate in this house! Racism. And constipation. Yeah, you're the Rosa Parks of pooping. I want chocolate pudding! Listen, English leather face-- No, no no. Let me-- Let me Karen. Thank you, darling. Now, look. Chocolate pudding it is. Thank you, daddy! I'll be in the TV room. Make one of the servants bring it in on their head. Sure. I know how much that amuses you. Darling. You have got to set some limits for your daughter. You have to tell her "no" once in a while. Believe me, I know. I am raising two step-children of my own. But your step-children went back to their mother. Yes. But when they came and begged to stay with me, in the home where they'd grown up, I said "No". I can see how difficult that must have been for you. But Lorraine and I are re-establishing our relationship, and I really want her to like me. Darling, she's not looking for a friend. She's looking for a father. You must give her some discipline. But, how do I discipline a thirty-two-year-old woman? Pretend she's two sixteen-year-olds. Well, we're excited too, and we look forward to getting your offer. They're making an offer? They're making an offer. Four frickin' offers?! Unbelievable! Stop it! Getting rich is fun. People that say money doesn't buy happiness, they're just not trying hard enough. Money isn't ruining us, is it? I mean, we're still good people, right? We're still the flippers who care? Well, of course. Why would you even ask that? I don't know. I mean, we did sort of steal this place from Zandra and force her into a home. What force? Getting into that place has been a dream of hers. She's wanted to die there her whole life. That's true. We did a good thing. We're good people. And there they are. The most dangerous thing to happen to old ladies since Ashton Kutcher. That is a joke that both entertains and teaches. The important thing to bear in mind is that Jack is very, very upset. Zandra is miserable in that Actors' Retirement Village. Those people are freaks. They were all character actors when they were young. Do you have any idea what they look like now? All bug-eyes and gap teeth still thinking they're nosey neighbors and wise-cracking best friends. You sure you weren't looking into a mirror? Go ahead, laugh! But know this. That money is cursed. You took advantage of that sweet, gentle lady. What's that above your eye? She put a cigarillo out on my forehead. Shame on you! Wow, this place is fantastic. Stuart, please. Don't be so adorable when I'm trying to be mad. I'm serious, sweetie. I just think this place would be perfect for a certain couple I know. One's a tall drink of water and the other one's much shorter and very thirsty. I think we should take the next step. I'm not ready for you to see me in drag. I want us to live together. I want to buy this place and make it our home. For reals?! Wait-wait-wait wait a minute. We'd love to sell it to you, but we already have four offers. Well, five if you count that homeless guy. And I think he just wanted to use the bathroom. Wait. Did he leave? Well, listen. I'll match your best offer and I'll sweeten the deal with a tin of my world-famous peanut brittle. Well, I don't know. I'm not sure Oh my God, this is really happening! Do I have to chip in? Not a penny. Oh my God, it's really happening! Wait a minute, what about Zandra. You said that she hated the Actors' Retirement Village. Oh, screw her. She got in with the Gabor clique, she's fine. I'm a bride!   
                




                    			Previously on Will & Grace Lyle Finster and I are back together! Really? Didn't you guys break up? 'Cause the last time we saw the two of you, you were taking advantage of him to get back at his daughter, Lorraine. Meanwhile, you developed real feelings for him in the process, but he no longer cared. He's back, he's moved in, and we're shagging like two lieutenants after lights out. Oh, darling, promise me it will always be this way. I wouldn't count on it. I was kicked out of my place, so I'm moving in here. Hello, mother! Oh, well, Grace and I are looking to buy a property to flip. we'll buy for a fair price. We'll invest our time and our creativity, and we'll flip for an honest profit. That's right. We're the flippers who care. So, are you thinking about selling your old place? What's it to you, chimp? I have the perfect buyers! This is Will and Grace. They're my best friends. Her husband abandoned her. His never existed. The place looks amazing. And we are gonna make a fortune! You know what? I want my home back! come on, give her the place back! No! I'm sorry, but she sold it to us. I want us to live together. I want to buy this place and make it our home. For reals?! What about Zandra. You said that she hated the Actors' Retirement Village. Oh, screw her. She got in with the Gabor clique, she's fine. I'm a bride! Will & Grace 6x16 "Flip-Flop part 2" Would you look at that great big, beautiful city. You know, they say there's a crime committed here every six seconds. Should we wait? Okay. Oh, my God. There it is. Wow, three seconds. Way ahead. Helloooo! Oh, hey, Will! I love when you add "O"s onto your hellos. It's, like, my favorite thing you do. Yeah, its true. We talk about it all the time. Really? Oh, that's good. I-I-I was toying with getting rid of it, but now I know it has a following. I just came by to drop off this paperwork. You are now Oh, isn't that great? Do you remember when gay people weren't allowed to be in escrow? And, to celebrate, little pre-housewarming gift, the Whirlybird popcorn maker. Oh, you shouldn't have. I didn't, I had two of them. I just thought it'd be a good gift for all those nights you guys'll be hanging out here at home, renting movies, eating popcorn. Oooh, I know. I can hardly wait. Soon as I've washed my hands 17 times, I'm gonna take it out of the box. I envy you two. Not having to go to the clubs. Not having that moment at the end of the night where you look around during last call, and everybody's paired up except for you and one trollish-looking guy. You figure, what the heck, and you go over to him, and he says no. That--that happened to a friend of mine. Yeah. Happened to a friend of mine too Well, anyway, I gotta get going. Why-why don't you, uh, sit with us for a bit? Hang out. It'll be fun. Oh, okay. Well, that was fun. See ya! Hey, thanks a lot. What? Why are you smiling? Did he fart? I was just thinking about what Will said. You know, he's right. Well, of course he's right. What self-respecting troll would go home with Will at the end of the night? No, no, not about that. About us. About how lucky we are. I mean, we are set. There's nothing left for us to do except sit back and grow old together. I don't know about you, but this girl ain't growin' old. No, that's why I take care of myself. I eat right, I exercise, and I take a multivitamin to avoid iron-poor blood like Evonne Goolagong. You don't have to worry about that anymore. You got the guy, give up the gym. Yeah, but I've been doing cardio ever since I was nine. now you don't have to anymore. You can finally stop running. Darling, are we being robbed? Can you see who it is? No, it's too dark. You stay there, Karen. I'm pretty good with this thing. You don't have to tell me about that. Oh, shoot. I thought it was someone trying to kill us. What are you doing? You scared me half to death. Well, what are you doing? I mean, it's the middle of the night. I know that. I'm drunk, not stupid. Now, keep it down. I've had a very rough night. I had to walk 140 blocks back from the Yankee Stadium after I lost your limo. You lost my limo? Oh, relax. I didn't misplace it. I lost it in a bet. I mean, who knew Hideki Matsui could hit a baseball further than me? Finny, are you hearing this? It's one thing that she doesn't clean her room, but now she's lost our limo to the Asian Willie Mays. Lorraine, this time you have gone too far. Daddy gonna crack the whip. It's all right. I'll handle this, thank you. Now, look, you are disrespectful. And you are irresponsible. And you need to learn that your actions have consequences. Okay? So-- You are going to pay for Karen's limo out of your own money. Or try winning it back using this house as collateral. Like hell I will. You'll do as I say, and you'll like it, young lady! I rather like this, Karen. No, no, no, no, no. It's too late for you to be a father. You don't care about me, and you never did. I'm gonna go and get a place of my own. You're never gonna see me again! I thought you were cool! Boy, you really showed her. Felt good, huh? Oh, I--I've made a horrible mistake. What? Well, I was finally building a relationship with her, doing all the things that I never got the chance to do before. Like the other day when she fell down and skinned her knee, I was there to kiss her boo-boo. Of course, I may now have hepatitis, but it--it brought us closer. Now she's gone, and I've ruined my liver for nothing. Are you implying that it's my fault that she left? Of course it's your fault! You can't stand me getting closer to her. You're always driving a wedge between her and me. And that's been your plan all along! No, Darling. I've been like a mother to that girl. I've locked her in her room, I've told her she was fat, and once I even left her in a store. Well, let me tell you something. Last time I chose you. This time, I'm choosing my daughter. But Finny, no Good-bye, Karen. Hi. Hi. Oh, thank God you're home. You will not believe what just happened. You washed a dish? I got a call on Zandra's place. Someone offered the most insane amount of money. How insane? If the money were a person, it'd be Courtney Love. Did--did you tell them that the place was already sold? No, I said that I would talk to you about it. Grace, we can't. We're in escrow. Oh, escrow. What is escrow? You know what it is. They've already put up the money. I thought it was something else. What's "force majeure"? Grace, the place is sold, okay? Stuart bought it. Besides, we're the flippers who care, remember? That's our motto. Read your coffee cup. Why do you think I had these made? You know, if we start screwing our friends over, we can never drink from these mugs again. You're right. You're right, I--I think I just got caught up in all that money. Just out of curiosity, how insane was that offer? Oh, my God! That's Courtney Love and Margot Kidder! On a hike with Anne Heche! No, no, no, it's-- Yes, it's a lot of money, but we-- You cannot put a price on integrity, right? I don't think Stuart and I should live together. I never thought you should! And you know, it's not too late to get out of escrow. Do you want to know why? Not really. I mean, I-I'm sure you've thought about it. You're a smart guy. Listen, is Stuart still in the apartment? 'Cause we could undo this thing right now. Will? I think we should hear him out. No. Grace, he's made up his mind. He doesn't want to take the apartment. We're not gonna-- not gonna force majeure 'im. Hey, I don't know what happened. I was there with Stuart in that apartment, and he was talking. And all of a sudden, we were old. There were cats, and housecoats, and CBS. And keeping tissues up our sleeves. I don't think I'm ready to be an old married lady. Does somebody have a shawl? It's really chilly in here. Jack, everyone gets nervous when they move in with someone. It's totally normal. Like me. When I moved in with Leo, I was really nervous. And you know what? Never shoulda done it. You're right. We're moving too quickly. I'm gonna go talk to Stuart. I hope this doesn't affect our friendship if we back out of the deal. Oh, how would you even ask? Oh, no. Okay, thanks, you guys, bye. Whoo hoo! Let's get him on the phone. Money-money-money-money Money! I guess on the beach towels, we should change it to "Flippers Who Don't Give A Crap." Oh, Rosie, I miss Lyle so much. Or do you just miss the idea of Lyle? No, I miss Lyle. But hey, good insight, lady. Well, in El Salvador, I was three credits short a Masters in Psychology. Well, I'm glad you came here to mop up my sick off the floor instead. Hey, Karen, get in. Why should I? I got your limo. I won it back from Hideki Matsui in a secret underground Iron Chef contest. Come on, get in. all right But only because I've been walking for blocks, and my feet are killing me. Oy, me too. Not you, Rosie. So, what are you doing here, Lorraine? You've taken your father away from me, and now you've come to rub it in my face? I haven't come to run anything in anyone's face. I already tipped the driver. No, I just came to apologize. I was awful. Hey, hey. Wait a minute. When we are in my limo, we listen to Soft Hits 106. Continue. Well I guess I was just scared. You know, I just found my dad. And--and it felt like you were taking him away from me. well, you won. He's all yours. What do you mean? All he talks about is you. He does? Well, where do you think I'm taking you, you gin-soaked old crone? Lorraine, why are you being so nice to me? Oh, because I hate this. You're sad, he's sad. Nobody's any bloody fun anymore. Well, to tell the truth, it hasn't been as much fun around the manse either, without you there. if only I could put into words how I feel. I love this song. A chair is still a chair, even when there's no one sitting there But a chair is not a house, and a house is not a home When there's no one there to hold you tight, and no one there you can kiss good night. I'm glad we didn't invite Rosie. I knew as soon as you said that to Jack, you were doing the wrong thing. I was just helpless to stop you. You jumped onboard. You made the final sale. You hypnotized me with your Svengali-like powers. And yet I can't get you to stop biting your toenails. How else do you get them shorter? Hellloooo. I'm glad you guys are both here. Yeah, we have something that we need to tell you. We did an awful thing. We really did. The reason we said you shouldn't live together is that we got another offer on this place for a lot more money. And it was just really wrong of us. The truth is, you guys are a great couple. And nothing would make us happier than to see you two set up house together. It really would. Why did you point on that one? It seems the shoe is on the other foot now, doesn't it? I don't know what you mean exactly. I think I might have put my Uggs on backwards. The difference between the toes is really subtle. I think what Jack's saying is that we were starting to feel little uncomfortable about moving in together so quickly. It seemed kind of lesbian of us to fall in love and shack up right away. Yeah, so, if you don't mind, I don't think we're gonna take the place. I guess--I guess you can take that other offer now. that's the furthest thing from our mind right now. Our biggest concern is your happiness. So, see ya. Hurry up, call them. Hurry up, hurry up. Are you kindding? I was dialing in my pocket as he was talking. Hi, hi, it's Will Truman. Right, listen, I've got some great news for you, uh, if you're still looking for an apartment. Money, money, money, money Oh, you did? No, that--that--no, that's okay. I--I understand. Money? They bought another place. You know what? Maybe we deserve this. Maybe this happened because we are supposed to learn a lesson. Maybe the flippers who care are supposed to care a little more. What are we gonna do with this apartment? Anyway, Zandra, we're-- we're really sorry we tried to kick you out of your home. And all we're asking for is-- is what we put into the place. That's very fair of you, Homo. I'm so glad to be out of the Actors' Retirement Village. Finally I can take a tub without Charlotte Rae staring at me. those-- Those are some Facts of Life I could've done without knowing. The--what? The--the place fell through? Well, no, no, of course it's still available. Zandra, your bag's still in the hallway, right? Now, look, as we're playing for money, I should warn you, I'm extremely good at this. Anyone else you'd like me to hit? Another drink please, barman. Hello, sailor. Look, I've only got a hundred dollars-- Karen? Hi, Dad. What are you doing here? I want us to be together. And I know you want it too. But I--I don't see how it's possible. I mean, I can't have the two women that I love most in the world going at it like Italians. Well, don't say it like that. It makes us sound so garlicky. But we've been doing some thinking. And we've realized that the reason we fight so much isn't because we're different. It's because we're the same. That's right. We're both money-grubbing, sex-starved women who are ofttimes mistaken for transvestites. And if that's not reason enough to build a relationship, I don't know what is. Look, I can't guarantee that we won't fight. But we're two women who love you, and want you to be happy. Is that such a bad thing? No, I suppose not. Three women would be better, but two's a start. I'm gonna leave you two alone. I'm gonna head back to my seedy little hotel room, which ironically was quite nice before I moved in. No, Lorraine, wait. Come back to the manse. Stay as long as you want. Really? Thanks. How 'bout you, stretch? You coming too? Oh, well, it doesn't seem proper, the three of us living together without benefit of marriage. Did I just hear a proposal? No, but now you've made it awkward. Good heavens, I wanted to marry you the first time I set eyes on you. Karen, before God, before these toothless whores and aging alcoholics, before my daughter, I proclaim my love. Will you marry me? Of course I will, Lyle. That is how you pronounce it, right? Yeah, Lyle, yeah. Oh, this is so exciting! Finally, the old man's getting married. And congratulations to you too, Dad.   
                




                    			God, Karen, your engagement ring is so gorgeous. Wow. I wanna ring like that. Maybe I should marry Finster. Or maybe I should just marry Martin Katz, jeweler to the stars. It is pretty, isn't it? I just wish it wasn't so big. I'm afraid it's gonna leave a mark on Rosario's cheek when I smack her for no particular reason. You're concerned about the help. Is something bothering you? Oh, it's just-- This is all happening so fast. Every since Finny and I got engaged, I've been having the most disturbing dreams. Oh, Karen, that's completely normal, yeah. - A lot of the times, 12-year-old boys like yourself have what we nurses call "Nocturnal"-- - Oh, not those kind of dreams. Those I like. No, in these dreams, I'm in my wedding dress, and a disapproving hippo is cross-examining me on the witness stand. What do you think it means? Well I was going to say it has something to do with Stan's feelings about your engagement but obviously that's not it, because the hippo in the courtroom is clearly Will. - So-- - No, no, no. Oh, honey, it is. It is Stan. His stomach is poking out at me from the other side. - Oh, what if he thinks I'm getting married too fast? Oh, honey, I wish I could talk to him! - But Karen, you can. - What? - Aren't you familiar with John Edward, from TV's "Crossing Over With John Edward"? He reunites people with their dead loved ones. And he wears fitted shirts tucked into his jeans, which is very brave for a three-camera format. Uh-uh. Every since my role as "Bank Teller" on "Mama's Family" was left on the cutting room floor, I don't do TV. Oh, Karen, you don't have to go on the show. He's signing copies of his new book After Life at Barnes & Noble. Yeah, we could talk to him there. Oh, well, I guess I could give it a shot. "Would you like it in fives, tens or fifteens?" Can you believe that got cut?! - Is Grace here? - Oh, honey, no, I'm sorry. She left. But you might try her at our Paramus location. I can't believe what just happened. Y-y-you know how Grace and I have been flipping properties together? You mean your new version of having sex with each other? Yeah. So yesterday we put a bid in on this East Side townhouse. We're this close to closing, and then this morning we get scooped by D & M Properties. Did you say D & M Properties? Oh, honey, you do not want to go up against them. That's Deirdre and Monet. The flipping dykes. These ladies are vicious. Mess with their livelihood, and they come down on you hard. And your only warning is the "click click click" of their Manolos. - You're crazy. Besides, we have a foolproof lead on the East Side nobody even knows about. - Oh, they know. They couldn't. It's Grace's Aunt Honey's condo. It's not even listed. And because of her glaucoma, she doesn't even realize what a bad deal she's getting. Shh-shh-shh shh-shh-shh-shh. Hear that? - I'm scared. - You should be. - Good morning. - Ah! Lesbian realtors! You must be Will. Hello, I'm Deirdre. And it's good to see you again, Karen. Stay back, bulldozer! I'm engaged. You were last time too. I've also found someone. Meet Monet, my new associate. One of the hottest young designers in the city. Hello. Stop looking at him. You're with women now. - I was just saying hello. - You were gushing. We hear that you and Grace have made quite a name for yourselves on the West Side. Kudos. - Thank you. - No. I see you have a box of Kudos on your desk. - Oh. Would you like one? - No, no. We don't eat. She likes me frail. Does this story have an ending, Monet? We're very happy for your success on the West Side, but just so there's no confusion, the East Side is our territory. What, did you pee at every corner of it? For your information, we are on the verge of acquiring a property there. Yes, about that. We spoke to Aunt Honey, and she's no longer as eager to sell to you. - How did you know-- - They know everything, Will. Because they don't sleep with men, their other senses are heightened. Now, stay off the East Side. You and Grace have a lovely co-op. I would hate to see a needle exchange open up next door. Or a Bennigan's. - Good-bye. - Keep it in your pants, Monet. I'm sorry, I need food. I already burned off that Tic Tac. Who can I make this out to? Jack McFarland. It's such an honor to meet you. I love your show. You're, like, my favorite medium. Although, in person, you look more like a Large. Hello, arms. Thank you for noticing. Just because I talk to the dead doesn't mean I can't look good. Right. Who can I make yours out to? Oh, um, I'm not here for that. I need you to get through to my late husband, Stanley Walker. You see, I'm engaged. Nice rock. What is that, Martin Katz? Damn, you are good. No You see, I can't go through with the wedding unless I have Stanley's blessing. And, um, could you get me through to Jude Law? - He's not dead. - Yeah, I know, but I would like to make contact with his other side. I'm not doing any readings here today. But it sounds like you just need to get in touch with your own feelings and emotions. Trust your heart. Spare me the mumbo-jumbo about heart and feelings. I am a rational, thinking woman, and I have come here to talk to a ghost. I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you today. Oh, well, thanks for nothing, John Edward. And to think, I almost voted for you. Hey, uh, when I die, you wanna grab dinner? - Flipping dykes? - Flipping dykes! - Flipping? - Dykes! I thought that was a myth. Like the weapons of mass destruction. - No, they're real. - Well, what do we do? Do we back off? No, no, no, no. That apartment belongs to us. I'm not gonna let a couple of Ellen-lovin', Jenny Shimizu calendar-buyin', Uggs in the summertime-wearin', lady lovers scare us off. But how can we compete with two hot women? I mean, look at us. We're barely one hot woman. Uh, speak for yourself. They are a power couple, there's no doubt about it. So I think our only hope is to divide and conquer. Yeah. What does that mean? It means if we can break them up, then their stranglehold on the East Side will crumble, and the only thing they'll be flipping is burgers. Yes. What's our plan? Look, on Animal Planet, why is it that the pumas always single out the one limpy gazelle for dinner? Ugh, there's gonna be nature in our plan? - Because he's the weak one. - Ah Ah! - Mm-hmm. Okay, so between Monet and Deirdre, which one's the weak one? Monet. She was totally checking me out. She's no lez. Oh, sure, when it was chic, she jumped on the bandwagon, but one little push, she'll be back on the man-wagon. Okay, look, we'll have them over. And we'll pretend like we're proposing a truce. Then at some point, I get the weak one in a clinch, you and the tough one walk in, tears, drama, finger-pointing, hair-pulling, we're done. - Oh, that's good. - Mm-hmm. If the Macarthur Foundation gave out Evil Genius Grants, you would so win one. - It is pretty awful. - Mm-hm. To evil! Come on, Karen. You're not seriously thinking of calling off your engagement, are you? Well, I don't know what else to do. I don't have Stanley's blessing. And if that psychic John Kerry can't put me in touch with him, then who can? It's too bad too. Lyle was a really good guy. He was. But don't give up! I love you two as a couple. Can I have your ring? - Okay. Well, good night, Kare. - Good night. - I love you. - Mmmm. Love you less. And who knows, Karen? Tonight might be the night that you hear from Stan. I hope so. Karen - It's Stan. - What? Stanley, oh, my God! Stanley! You have my blessing to marry Finster. - I do? - Yes. - See ya. - Wait, oh, wait! Wait! Stanley, come back! Tell me, what's heaven like? Uh, it's It's like a long room. Kind of like a hallway. With a credenza and fancy wallpaper. Oh, and there goes Rosie. Hey, girl! Oh. Anyway, where was I? Oh, yeah-- Your order comes to 8.79. Thank you, please drive around. Good save, Burger Queen. Oh, Jackie, how could you? You know that heavenly voices speak to me every night over the intercom, and you abused that knowledge! You have really crossed a line this time. I can never forgive you. - Can I sleep over? - Yeah, but no pajama bottoms. - Okay. Anyway, thanks for coming over tonight. We knew if we just sat down and talked, we could get past this silly rivalry. Rivalries are stupid. Except for the whole Hilary Duff/Lindsay Lohan thing. That seems legitimate. - Yes, I have to tell you, this is a new thing for us. We rarely go out. - She likes me pale. Anyway, about that whole Aunt Honey thing, we're sorry we were on your turf. I guess I just figured since she was my favorite aunt, if anyone was gonna rob her blind, it would be me. Well, Grace, there's no room for emotion in business. Or anywhere in life. - More wine, Monet? - Wup-up. No, she's fine. - But I want some wine. - I said enough. Grace, this apartment is wonderful. My husband and I had one just like it. Until I fell in love with his sister. - Are the bedrooms large? - Mine is. I'll bet it is. Grace, could you help me with something in the kitchen? Heh-heh Don't forget me when I'm gone. Settle down, you're making a fool of yourself. What are you waiting for? Make your move. Go for the weak one so we can walk in and catch you. I will, I just have to figure out a way to get her in the bedroom. She's a designer. Ask her opinion on something. Right, right. Ooh! I'll ask her what she thinks of my new dust ruffle. Great. And then you can show her the scarf you're knitting and give her a list of the movies that make you cry. Be a guy, you big 'mo! - So, Monet-- - I'd love to. - All right! So, I guess we should sit down for, like, anywhere from two to five minutes. Oh, look. You need more wine. - Oh, that's okay. I think I've had enough. - No, no, no, please. There is nothing sexier than a beautiful woman with a glass of wine in her hand. Deirdre, when you're right, you're right. So, this is it. This is where it all happens. Yeah, this baby has seen me through some pretty wild times. I am talkin' wuh-ild. Damn it! I have told that cleaning woman a thousand times, what's the point of having a dust ruffle if you can see metal? I mean, uh Dust ruffle. - So, uh, where were we? - Shut up and french me. There was a time when I thought about being a lesbian, but it seemed like a lot of extra work. Well, it is a commitment. Oh, I-- Hey, I forgot. Where's Will and Monet? - You know what, we should probably go check on them. Why don't you walk into the room ahead of me? - No, forget them. I want you. - Huh? - Be my partner. Look, I thought I made it clear about all the extra work and everything. I mean, I just like to lay there. No, my design partner. Monet is fine. I mean, no one does more with black and cement, but how many apartments can you sell to Moby? Oh Well, I'm kind of already partners with Will. God, well, imagine what the two of us could do together. God, your hair is gorgeous. Go on. Sure, Will seems nice. And he puts together an okay party platter. But I have got a ton of money. And I can take you places you've never been before. Don't you want that, Grace? Don't you want to go to those places? Wow. That's hot. Women. Sexy. Yum. - What time is it? - Oh, God, you are such a good kisser. You kiss like a girl. Well, I-- I throw like one too. - Wait, wait, whoa. Did you hear something? - Mm-mm. No, I--I thought I heard Grace at the door. Grace, is that you? D-don't come in here. Don't you and Deirdre come in here right now! Deirdre, stop. You're--you're making me all confused. - Then I'll make it simple. Say yes. Be on my team. I want you on my team. - Stop saying "team." Look, look Will is my partner. I am committed to him. You have to respect that. Please. Okay. I understand. I completely understand. - Thank you. - Would you like to dance? - Okay. Jack. Jack, wake up! Honey, wake up. Wake up right now. Wake up. Jackie, Jackie. What? Karen! I was right in the middle of a great dream. Jude Law and I were taking a Jacuzzi. And I was looking at the long arm of the Law. Heh Honey, have you been asleep this whole time? Except when I peed. But I never got out of the bed. Why? Then it was him. Honey, Stan spoke to me. I was downstairs making a ham sandwich, and all of a sudden, I heard Stan's voice. Oh, my God! Did you put mayo on it? Honey, I'm telling you, it was him. Stan spoke to me! - Well, you know, it makes sense. - Really? In Native American mythology, the refrigerator is the portal to dead fat people. Oh, my God. What did he say? Is heaven fabulous? Do they let gay people in? No, wait, I wanna be surprised. Honey, he said that I could marry Finny. He said that all he's ever wanted was for me to be happy. Well, I told you that Karen. He'd want you two to be together. Even when he was alive, he fantasized about you with other men. Why should it be any different when he was dead? Oh, Jackie. This calls for champagne. I'm so excited! Now I can get married. You know, I guess I just needed to hear it from the man himself. Mm. - How did that happen? - I just do a better Stan than you. Grace! What the hell?! Give us a minute. Excuse us. What the hell-- what the hell is going on? Wh-what about the plan? I'm in there vamping for 20 minutes. I'm supposedly out here now looking for condoms! I'm thinking about becoming partners with Deirdre. She thinks I'm pretty. What?! Don't you see what she's doing? She's trying to break us up. She's a puma! She is. And I'm the weak one! I'm the limpy gazelle. How dare you. How dare you use sex as a weapon to prey on this innocent girl? Will? Did you find any rubbers? I'm with him now. Don't be a simp. He's using you. Just like I'm using her. - What?! - What?! - Is that true?! - Is that true?! - Kinda. - Kinda. - You were using me? - You were using me? - Oh, come on! You were all over me. - And you were all over me. - Is that true?! - Is that true?! - Kinda. - Kinda. - You bitch! - You bitch! - You bitch! - You bitch! W-w-w-wait! Is this what we've been reduced to? Cheap sexual ploys? Over what? Real estate? I'm ashamed of all of us. You're really not into me at all? I'm not big on the redheads. Can I look at it later? I think twice was enough. Look, we don't want any more trouble. W-we-- W-w-well, you guys take the East Side, and we'll just stay on the West Side. Fine. I'm tired of dressing to intimidate anyway. I can't wait 'til being lesbian goes out of style again. I can go back to my sweats and loose neckties. So, you're not mad at me? Are we still a team? Of course, darling. You know I love being a team with you. What is it with them and the word "team"? Besides, I don't blame you. He's beautiful. He's like a female k.d. lang. - Are you mad at me? - Yes, I'm furious. - Oh, what else is new? - Well, thanks for having us over. - Yeah, let's make it a weekly thing. - Remember, I don't want to see you anywhere near the East Side. - Yeah! - I don't like you butch. That was fun. I kind of liked being a lesbian. Yeah, me too.   
                




                    			Hey, you wanna be my second choice for the movies? We can go to a family film and look for gay subtext. Nah. I'm just gonna hang around here get out the old tool box and do some fix-it work around the house. Oh, if you're going to give yourself a pedicure, you have to get more cotton balls, 'cause I took 'em all. Damn it! How many times have I told you to stay out of my tool box? Come on, Will. I don't wanna go to the movies alone, like an overweight woman. Well, ask Grace to go. Grace? It'd be kinda weird. I mean, we hardly even know each other. Why, you have things in common. Like your love of the new format of Star magazine and-and not knowing who's running for president. I don't really like voting. What's the point of stepping into a booth if you can't get fondled? Hi, gays! Listen, Will, I need you to drive me around for the rest of the day. Driver's getting his ears pinned. I couldn't stand lookin' at those Dumbo flaps for one more second. Karen, I'm not your chauffeur. In fact, I think we discussed this when I came back from Bali with a tan, and you told me to bring the car around. Kare, why don't you just drive yourself? Uh Sweetheart, heh, I don't know what century you're living in, but women aren't allowed to drive. Karen, you don't know how to drive, do you? Nah, never had to. Plus somebody's gotta be the designated drinker. But, hey, since you work for the DMV, maybe you could teach me. No, no, no, no. Get Finster to do it. No, he's British. He'll teach me to drive on the wrong side of the road. Isn't that where you're gonna end up anyway? Well, get Jack to do it. Jack? That dope? That dope couldn't teach a monkey how to scratch his own ass. It's true. Good, good. You're doin' very well. Oh, honey, I love driving. It's exhilarating. Let's take her up! -Come on. - Karen, this isn't a flying car. It is when you've smoked as much as I have. Just concentrate on the road. You're doing just fine. But give it a little more gas. - Okay, now heads up. Next block there's a woman with a baby carriage. - I'm on it! No, no! Don't speed up! Oh, damn, it's a cop. - I'm on it! - No, no, no! You've gotta stop! He's pulling us over. Okay, listen, there's something you should know. I was just a kid, 14 or so, and I fell in with the wrong crowd. - One kid's father had a gun. And I didn't want the others to think I was chicken, so we see this businessman really full of himself. - Here he comes. Reel it in. Point is, I never did nothin'. And you don't know nothin' about nothin'. You got me? - You know how fast you were going? - How could I? I'm inside it. - Officer, is there a problem? - License and registration, please. Oh, sure. No problem. Meet license and registration. We're sorry, officer. We won't do it again. You should've seen what she showed customs when they asked for her passport. Oh, hey, buddy, I'm sorry, but this seat's taken. By my feet. How happy are you that I snuck in Chinese? Happier than a gay teen with new ice skates. Hello, that's a little gross to be eating smelly food in a movie theater. Will an egg roll shut you up? It will. Okay, um, I promised Stuart, I'd see this movie with him. So don't tell him we saw it. When he found out I saw Calendar Girls first, he went ber-serk. He didn't talk to me for the whole shower. Hey, isn't that him? Um-mm, nope. Couldn't be. Stuart's working. You just think it's him because when you're in love with someone, you imagine you see them everywhere. - But I'm not in love with Stuart. - Yet you see him everywhere! You know, it stinks like Chinese food in here. That sounds just like Stuart's laugh. It's so annoying when he does it in bed. - Why does he laugh in bed? - Mind your own beeswax. I'm gonna check it out. - Oh, my God, that is Stuart! - Who's the guy with him? - Guy?! Oh, my God, there is a guy. How dare he! Okay, okay, calm down. So he lied about having to work. So he's seeing the movie he promised to see with you. So he's here with a hot, young guy Do we have a point? You know, you'd think I would. I'm gonna go confront him. I'd slap him silly if it didn't make him laugh in bed. No, no, just-- Come on. Sit down. You're too upset. We always regret the things we do in the heat of anger. Besides, I need someone to hold my mu shu pancake. Listen, officer, I realize she was going a little over the speed limit-- And that's a ticket you're writing. Well, it isn't a poem about springtime in Cincinnati. Why Cincinnati? First town I thought of. Actually, the second. But nobody would write a poem about Newark. Nothing rhymes with it. - What rhymes with Cincinnati? - Just take the ticket. - Have a nice day. - You too. - Jerk. - What was that? - I said bye! Bye. See ya. Oh, my gosh. That is the single scariest thing that has ever happened to me. And I've seen Rosario at the beach. God, I can't believe this. Like cops don't have anything better to do. How 'bout stopping crimes? You know, how 'bout getting unlicensed guns off the street? Or off your lap?! Has that been there the whole time? Oh, come on. Don't get all down on yourself 'cause you're gay. Let's just pay it. Yeah, I guess you're-- Whoa-ho! Hang on. I think I spy a loophole. Oh, honey, is my passport showing? No. It looks like he forgot to sign the ticket, which means it's invalid. We are so gonna fight this in traffic court. Whoa! Watch out for that nun. - I'm on it! - No! Don't speed up! Did you see that? That guy just whispered something to Stuart. I didn't trim hair out of that ear so some young hottie could whisper sweet nothings in it without getting hair in his mouth. I can't take it! I'm gonna go talk to him. Wait. Before you do anything, count to ten. - Why? - 'Cause Will said you couldn't. Excuse me, Theater 14, I know you think you've come to watch a movie. But you are about to witness a scene. - Jack, what are you doing here? - What am I doing here? What are you doing here? - Shh! - Grace! Do not shush me during my inappropriate outburst! Ladies and gentlemen, I find myself in a situation similar to the one Drew Barrymore is going through on the screen. Although, unlike her, I am not overacting. - Look, Jack-- - I don't want to hear it! You're a liar and a cheat. And if we had the same right to marry in this country, you'd be an adulterer too. I hate you, and I never want to see you again! Good-bye. And thank you for coming to Loew's. Sit back and relax. Enjoy the show. Hey. We're up next, okay? So, so let me do the talking. Don't do anything disruptive. Give me the booze. - Oh. - And the pills. - Aw! And the pills. And the pills. And the whoopee cushion. Will, if you take my whoopee cushion, how am I supposed to do my Inherit the Wind gag? For the last time, no Inherit the Wind gag, and no telling the judge to keep it in his robe. Boy, I cannot wait to humiliate that smug cop in that courtroom. Just rub his nose in his mistake and laugh as he walks out of there with his tail between his legs. Hi, Angry. Mad much? Listen, I'm gonna hit the vending machines. I've been jonesin' for a Score bar all day. - Well, hello there. - You smilin' at me? I'm not smiling. I'm smirking. You're probably wondering what I'm smirking at. Not really. I'm smirking because, boy, have you got a surprise comin'. - Probably wondering what that surprise is. - Not really. I'll give you a clue. You're a conductor. You're shakin' a snow globe. All right, no wait. You're a-- You've had a hand transplant. Your body rejected the hand. And now your hand is trying to get away by hailing a cab. - Wrong! You stink at charades. - No, you stink at charades! Hey, buddy, didn't sign the ticket. Crap! I always do that. I also forget to sign my checks. My therapist says it's because I'm not showin' up for myself. Oh, man, they're gonna stick me behind a desk now. Well, NYPD boo-hoo. Maybe can pull or a paper clip. And-and give him a ticket for, uh, for clipping together-- I don't know how to finish that. The point is you're screwed. Oh, yeah? Well, your fancy suit doesn't hide the fact that you still stink at charades. My baby don't mess around 'cause he loves me so and this I know for sure. Hey ya. Hey ya-- Hello? I'm sorry, I'll stop. Will you hang on a second? I've got another call. Hello? Yes, I'll stop. That's it. I'm done with men. I'm into women now. Come on, let's make hot hetero love together. Take off your breasts and turn around. Oh, if only that was the first time a guy said that to me. You know, at some point, you are going to have to talk to Stuart. - Grace, you don't understand-- - No! You don't understand! - What? - I just needed to get your attention. Can you get me some milk out of the fridge? These cookies are a little-- without it. I'm sorry, you were saying? You don't understand, Grace. He lied to me. And honesty's kind of, like, a big deal to me. It's kinda what I'm known for. Well, that and this There you are. Why haven't you returned my calls? I left messages for you in a cute voice. I rewrote the lyrics to Carousel to reflect our situation. I cried. I've done everything a man is supposed to do. Oh. Stuart. I hardly recognized you without the 12 rows of theater seats behind you and another man at your side. - Jack, listen to me. - No, you listen to me-- - No, You listen to me! - What? - Can you put this back? I think I'm done now. You know, you haven't given me a chance to explain. Oh, really? All right. Well, let's hear it. What's your explanation for lying to me and telling me you were working, when really you were out at a movie with a hot guy? He's my son. Oh, my God. That is exactly what happened today on Passions. Was he raised by pirates? Because that would just be a really weird coincidence. You know what? Maybe Will was right. Maybe you can't count to ten. How do you have a son? Well, like, like many young people, when I was in college, I experimented with heterosexuality. Mindy and I shared a bathroom for two semesters, and now we share a son for the rest of our lives. I'da told you sooner, but I didn't know how you'd react. I just think it's weird you didn't tell me you had a son. It makes me doubt us. - Jack, have you told Stuart you have a son? - No, but that's different. I forgot I had one. - You have a son? - Yeah. His name's Elliot. When he was 17, he donated some sperm because he wanted to buy a leather coat. We used to call it his member-only jacket. But, you know, now that there's an actual life involved, we just call it a jacket. Good God, do you ever stop eating? Well, I guess there's still a lot that we don't know about each other. Yeah, I guess so. Like, you should probably know that I tell people I like pistachios, but I don't. - So we're okay, right? - I guess so. - All right. - Aww, gay love. I miss it. - I'd love to meet your son sometime. - Oh, I'd love to meet yours. - My what? At which point, I noticed the defendant speeding by. I clocked her doing 42 in a 25 zone. So I pulled her over and issued a citation. Thank you, officer. I-I also found a voodoo doll of Marlo Thomas in the trunk. It was spooky, Your Honor, but I don't think it broke any laws. Your Honor, I would like to cross-examine the witness, if I may. Uh, this is traffic court. I'm aware of that, seeing as Your Honor is eating a sandwich. However, if you'll indulge me-- For the record, my name is Will Truman. I'm the attorney for the defense. Wait-- You're Will Truman? - Yes, and I'll ask the questions here. - No, it's just-- I'm Vince. I'm friends with Joe and Larry. - You're Vince, friends with Joe and Larry? - Yeah, they've been tryin' to fix us up for years. Wh--?! You're kidding! You're--you're--you're the Vince that rides a motorcycle and makes his own lotions? That's me. And you must be the Will that makes an olive tapenade that would make you faint. I don't know about faint, but you may want to be in a room full of pillows just in case. Uh, Mr. Truman. This isn't happy hour at the Manhole. It's a court of law. Oh, please, eat your sandwich. I can't believe we're meeting like this. I know. This is so weird. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come here. This isn't happy hour at the Cockpit. This is a court of law. Now get your ass out there and litigate, bitch! Uh, Your Honor, we don't dispute the officer's version of the events. However, there is a single piece of evidence-- - Just one minute. - It's fine, I've got pudding. Karen, I have a problem. This is the first cute, available guy I've met in a long time. And there's a very good possibility that he's into me. Can we please drop this ticket? A possibility? You wanna sell me out for a possibility? Listen, mister, if we're gonna throw this case, it's gonna be for a sure thing. Excuse me. Hey. Robe. Permission to approach the hot cop. Sure. Listen, I have got one question for you, and you had better consider your answer very carefully. My attorney is horny as hell. I know he's not much to look at, but he's horny as hell. Now, if we drop this whole thing, would you go out on a date with him? - Sure. - Remember, you're under oath. Yeah. I like his hair. - Well, Your Honor, we're all done here. - Me too. - So, I'll see you Friday night. - Great. And just so you know, I'm usually a better lawyer than this. Sure. And look, I-I don't want you think because I didn't sign your ticket, that I'm some kind of flake. I really am a very good cop. Jeez, where's my gun? I must have left it in the the john. I'm in so much trouble. Truman shoots. Truman scores. Hee hee. I haven't felt this good about myself in a long time. Uh-oh, did someone just Inherit The Wind? Odor in the court! Odor in the court! My baby don't mess around because he loves me so and this I know for sure. Hey ya-- Hey, wait a minute. Will didn't teach me how to brake. Car, stop. Car, stop! Oh, well. Something'll stop me.   
                




                    			Hi. Is Will back from his date with that cop guy? No, still out. He is? I figured by now he be curled up in his bed crying himself into a Snickers bar. Why do you do that, Jack? You're his friend. Why does Will's pain always amuse you? 'Member that time his date went so badly, he came home and started writing a play? Ah! You mean, If Gay Means Happy, Why Am I So Sad? Yes, that-- Well, this is the first time I've had a police escort to my door. Well, second. I was dressed as a prostitute for Halloween. There was a bit of a mix-up. I have a hard time too on Halloween in the Village. People never believe I'm a cop. They're always asking me where the Indian and the construction worker. - Okay, let me see. - No. No. Get off. - You get off. - Get-- Hi! Oh, hi! What are you doing? We were just, uh, looking for a new spot in the apartment to hang out. - Jack, what do you think about right here? - This looks great. Looks like a keeper. This works. Who are you calling? Vince. Even though I'm gonna see him in the morning for coffee, I just thought it might be nice to leave him a message telling him how much I like him and how I can't wait to see him again. It's what I do after a first date. It's kinda my thing. Yeah, you know what else is kinda your thang? Not having a second date. Put the phone down. Well, isn't it rude not to leave a five minute message Including a top ten list of the night's best moments? For someone who is so smart in life, you are so dumb in love. Why? What are you talking about? Will, you're too needy. It's a turnoff. The whole town's talkin' about it. Well, I'm talkin' about it. The whole town's listening. I like him. What's wrong with telling him I like him? There's nothing wrong with-- It's just-- Okay, look. Let me come at it from a-- from a different angle here. Um, okay. Okay. What quality do you find most attractive in a man? - When he ignores me? - Exactly. Let someone chase you. Let someone call you. Let someone do for you. But I don't want to play those games. My god, I mean, I'm in my early thirties. Darling You, like your waist size, are not in your early thirties anymore. Try playing it cool for once. Men don't like to be chased. They like to do the chasing. But we're both men. We're in an ugly area. Let's move on. Oh, honey, where have you been? I've been waiting here at the water cooler for us to have our water cooler chat. So did you start talking about "Sex and the City" yet? We just started. Oh. Honey, I am so glad that Carrie ended up with Big instead of that 70-year-old ballerina. I know. And when she walked into that coffee shop at the end and the other girl started screaming, I'm not ashamed to say I was crying like a little girl. Well, of course, I was piercing my ears too. - Oh, honey, I'm gonna miss my "Sex and the City." - Oh. Me too, Karen. But at least I've still got my "Frasier" and my "Friends." Well, wait, didn't you hear? "Frasier" and "Friends" are going off the air too. Don't tell me that, Jackie! Not now. Not today. Believe me, Karen, I know. It's tragic. I went through some of the biggest changes of my life with those shows. Cargo pants came in, went out, came back in again. I don't know whether they're in or out, but I bought 32 pairs of them with Will's money so I'm gonna wear 'em. You wanna talk about changes? I went through perhaps the most important milestone of my life: the tiny knapsack. Oh, the tiny knapsack. How could a knapsack so tiny hold all my dreams? Oh, Jackie, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna talk about around this water cooler every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning? I don't know, Karen. I mean, you hear about when other people lose their shows, but you never think it's gonna happen to you. It makes me sick to think how cruel I was to my own mother when "Barnaby Jones" got cancelled. You know, when Stan died, I knew just what to do. A few months later, I simply got engaged to someone else. But this is different, Jackie. This is television. But, Karen, don't you see? We just have to find a new show. Something that combines the gay sensibility of "Sex and the City," the gay sensibility of "Frasier," and the gay sensibility of "Friends." Honey, you mean like "Magnum, P.I."? No, Karen. That show got cancelled years ago. You know, I never really had my heart set on being a cop. I just knew I wanted to wear blue and ride around in a car with another guy all day. Besides, with all four of my brothers being cops-- Wow, five brothers, all cops? I think I have that video. You hear that laugh? He digs me. What's Grace talking about? I don't have to be cool and aloof to get a guy to like me. I can just be myself. In fact, this is the perfect time to-- You know, there's this new bar I've been dying to check out. The Third Street Grill. It's the first gay bar in Manhattan that doesn't have a pun in its name. Although lately, we've been referring to it as "The Third Street Girl." Tomorrow night, you wanna go? Ooh, I don't know. I'm not sure what time I'm working till. Well, why don't I just give you all my numbers? That way you can call me when you're done. I'm not really doing anything. Just a night of soup and online Yahtzee. - So, yes? - Maybe. Maybe's not a no. Well, as the homicide detectives like to say, I'm gonna go window-shop the muffins. You pathetic, needy, idiot! Grace was right. Why didn't I let him ask me out? Ugh. I've gotta remember to buy Bounce. Buy Bounce. Buy Bounce. Wait, what was the other thing I was thinking about? Oh, right. Let him come to me. Hey, is there a lot of fat in madeline's? You know, those holsters can be so unforgiving. What? You know what, actually, I just--I just remembered I-I-I actually have plans for tomorrow night. So forget about the bar. Oh, really? 'Cause I was gonna see if I could maybe move some stuff around. - Well, you know, why don't you, uh, why don't you check in with me late tomorrow, I'll see where I am. - Okay. Well done, Billy boy. How come more people don't call me that? Oh, right. 'Cause I'm 40. All right. This is it, Jackie. The beginning of a new era. We are going to let new fictitious characters into our lives. Now, I think it's important to be fair to these new shows. So let's give each one of them five seconds to grab our interest. All right. Bring on the shows. - Nope. - Nope. Fat guy, skinny wife. Fat guy, skinny wife. Fat guy, skinny wife. Ugly guy, skinny wife? America is not ready for that. Ugh. The stock dumb character. When are they gonna stop insulting our intelligence with these morons? Jackie, you accidentally turned it off. You're looking at your reflection. Oh. Okay, now this is like a pastiche of five other shows like something written by a committee. They're trying to please everybody, but ironically have ended up pleasing nobody. It's hopeless, Jackie. TV is over! You're right. There's never gonna be shows like that again. There's never gonna be a funky barka lounger in an immaculate Seattle living room with two brothers, one fussier than the next. Or six friends living together. Could a show be any funnier? Or four women sitting around drinking cosmos talking about penises and penis-hers. Jackie, I think you're forgetting about the fifth woman, a lady I like to call Manhattan. So what are we gonna do, Karen? I guess we'll just have to find something else to talk about. Hey. You know, we could go out and have life experiences of our own, then get together later and discuss them. You know, like the people on TV do. Right. That's good, Karen. I'll meet you at Central Perk in an hour. - Jack, that place is fictitious. - Okay, two hours. - Hey. - Oh, hey. I was about to give up on you. You said you were gonna be here an hour ago. Well, I say a lot of things. Only mean about half of them. Gimlet me. Double time. Apology accepted. Hey, David. - You know that guy? - We had a thing once. Really? 'Cause he keeps pointing to himself and mouthing, "I'm not David." FYI, guys whose names I can't remember, I call "David." - You wanna dance? - Whoa, whoa, slow down. I just walked in. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, call me, you monster! - Let me guess. David. - I'm so--I didn't know there would be so many of my exes here tonight. - Listen, are you feelin' okay? 'Cause you seem a little-- - What? Cool, aloof, not needy? Might be. I hope that works for ya. Right. Look, I'm gonna hit the john and maybe bust these two guys for sellin' ecstasy. 'Scuse me. Hey, he's a nice guy. Why are you being such an ass to him? I'm not being an ass to him, okay? I'm playing it cool. Guys like that. Really? Then why is he dancing with that guy that looks like Gwyneth Paltrow? Huh?! I tell you, men are such bitches. Why do I work here?! - Hello? - Grace, look. I followed your advice, and now Vince is on the dance floor with another guy. Okay, listen. Just play it cool, okay? This is how gay men operate. The two of you are locked in a high stakes, erotic, pied-a-terre. - Pas de deux. - That's what I said. You said "pied-a-terre." That's an apartment. I know. I took Spanish for two semesters. Just keep ignoring him. It'll work. I promise you. Before I do that, is there any chance that your advice could be wrong? Chance? Of course. Good chance. Just look at my love life before I met Leo. Look at my love life after I met Leo. Really, when I give you advice, I'm just talking out of my ass. I can't believe I ever listen to you! Never again! Okay, what do I do now? Well, it's a puzzle. I mean, clearly, he's a guy who hates guys who play games. Like the games you told me to play. Yeah. He hates that. So, I think the best chance you have right now is to just completely put yourself out there. Just totally show him how you feel, like some huge, exposed, raw nerve just covered in need. In other words, what I was gonna do to begin with. Like I said, outta my ass. Oh, boy, Kare, that was great. Who needs TV when you can have life experiences like that? - Right! - Okay, my turn. - Okay. - Okay. So I went to a delicatessen-- A delica what? A delicatessen. And after I placed my order, I had realized I had forgotten to say, "All white meat turkey." Uh-oh. So I went back to the guy, and I said, "Could you make that all white meat turkey, please?" And you know what he said? No, but I bet it's gonna tickle and inform me. He said, he said, "Sure." That's it? That's your life experience? It's a lot better than yours. "Rosario's brother is a political prisoner." Boring. Yours was boring! At least mine was topical. Mine had two characters and a twist. - What was the twist? - He said "Sure!" Jackie, let's face it. Without our shows, we're nothin'. - I know. It's so sad. Never be happy again. - No. 'Scuse me, did I leave a cell phone here? LILITH!! We love you, Lilith! That's great. Thank you. Thank you. It's Bebe. Ha ha ha ha ha. God, love you, Lilith, you're so dry. Your unemotional monotone provides a needed balance for Frasier's neurotic histrionics. Plus, you've got the body of a 14-year-old Korean gymnast. Yeah, I get that a lot. Well, it's always nice to meet fans. Especially in a public place with lots of witnesses and clearly marked exits. - Lilith, come sit down. - Sit down. Sit, sit. - So, Lilith - Bebe. - Oh, my god. - So, Lilith, now, we've stood by your show for 10 years. Frasier's been on the air for 11. We didn't care for season eight. How could you end it like this? How could you just walk out on us without an explanation? Okay, you two really need to let go. - But we can't! - No, I mean, let go. You're hurting me. God, ow. Look, just move on, okay? I have. There's more to me than Lilith. We've never seen it. Come on. Talk like Lilith, we hate your real voice. Well, I will if you will. Look, you guys, you guys are freaks, man. I'm not Lilith, I'm Bebe. I'm an actress. I sing. I'm a Broadway dancer. Look at these pins. You know any 40-year-olds who can wrap their legs around their necks? Look, these babies worked for me before "Frasier," they're gonna work for me afterwards. So don't you worry about Lilith. - You mean Bebe. - No, I mean Lilith. I want to play that bitch forever. - You do? - Oh, yeah. What about your pins? Oh, screw my pins. "Frasier" is such an easy gig, man. They fly you first class to Los Angeles, put you up in the Bel Air Hotel, per diem. I deliver several lines in a robotic monotone and I'm buyin' a new Lexus. - Oh, my God, Lilith's back! - Lilith's back! Yay! - Hey, you looked really good out there dancing with that other guy. - Thanks. See you around. Vince, wait. Officer, arrest me for being an idiot. I feel awful. I made a horrible mistake. That guy that I was before, that's not me. I was just-- I was just playing a game. Will, I don't play games. Look, I'm a romantic. Call me old-fashioned, but I believe when a guy takes another guy out, he should treat him like a lady. I believe that too. Look, I really liked you, so I didn't want to scare you away by showing you what a desperate mess I really am. You know, that's-- That's why I didn't call you after our first date or send flowers to the precinct or ask to see your driver's license photo so I could sneak a peak at your birthday and write it in my Palm Pilot with a reminder for the week before: Buy Vince present, smiley face. I don't like when you call yourself a mess. You should learn to love yourself, Will. And then love will come to you. I know that sounds simple, but it took me six years of therapy and a bullet to the neck to figure that out. Wow. You're a bigger mess than I am. You say mess, I say work in progress. Look, uh, what do you say we get outta here? You know, maybe get a cup of coffee? April 3rd. Oh. Okay. Was kinda hoping now. Me too. April 3rd is my birthday. - You know, for your Palm Pilot. - Oh, oh! I was just-- I was just kidding about that. I'm not such a big geek that I'd actually-- Oh, who the hell am I kidding? April 3rd, did you say? While I have you here, what is your hat size? Come on, let's get outta here. Oh, hey, on the way home, do you mind if we stop? I gotta buy Bounce. Hey, Jackie, did we get a little nutty? Thinking that some made-up character could help us? Maybe a little? But it doesn't matter. We don't have to resolve this till the same time next week. I just wish we had something to remember her by. Oh. I got her wallet. Honey, I couldn't resist. She had the tiny knapsack.   
                




                    			You look handsome. Thank you. April fool's. You got me. You are so clever. -Thank you. -April fool's. You know, I love this holiday. You don't have to buy presents or nothin'. Actually, I bought you a present. I bought you one too. -April fool's! -April fool's! So, why are you so happy and light today? Your anger lines are positively beaming. I went out with Vince last night. We went to see the revival "Fiddler on the Roof." And we shared a box of Fiddle Faddle. And so I said, "Hey, it's too bad we're not eating this on the roof, 'cause then it would be "Fiddle Faddle on the Roof." Please keep that to yourself. The religious right already hates us enough. So, what does Grace think? Oh, they haven't met yet. They haven't met? How do you know if you like him? Are you implying that I would need Grace's approval to know whether or not I like somebody? Do you really think that our friendship is that sick and co-dependent that even as I'm saying this, I'm realizing it's true. You should do it. You should get them together, see what she thinks. Pay now or pay later. You're right. They should meet. Remember that one guy, Ted? We went out for a few months. We even talked about moving in together. All she had to say was "Mock turtleneck," and it was over. Hey, Wilma. Okay, Jackie, I'm ready for my dance lesson. Whoo. I haven't been out on the dance floor since Studio 54. ' Course I'll be a lot more relaxed this time knowing Liza's not in the coat room poking through my stash. Karen needs to learn the Fox Trot so she doesn't embarrass herself at her wedding. Oh, there'll be plenty of time for that when she passes out in the wedding cake. Say, Wilma, I saw you and your new boyfriend last night at the theater. Yeah, between the Jews on stage and the homos in the audience, it was like payin' 100 bucks to hang out here. So Has Grace met your new fella yet? Not yet. hen how do you know if you like him? Welcome to the dance! Fact. Before language, people communicated through intricate choreography, costume changes, and lighting. Language was only invented when unattractive people were born and needed to be commented on. Any thoughts, questions-- Can we skip ahead a few thousand years? I have to learn to Fox Trot! Lyle is an expert, and I have to keep up with him. The man was in the British military for five years. You don't get better dance training than that. Don't I know it. My grandfather was one of the first ballerinas to land on the beach at Normandy. Fact: D-Day stands for Dance Day! Now Let's start with a simple box step. It is called that because we lead with our box. Well, if I can fake happiness with I can certainly dance with it. And one, and two, and -- to the side -- three -- good -- and four. Once again. And one -- very good -- and two, and three, and, um -Four. -Yes, four. Right, and spin. Very good. Yeah, very good. One Jack This is so much fun. I can't wait to try this with a man. But I am a man. Yes, you are. Okay, well that was very good. You got the basics down. Let's move on. Let's try a little somethin' new. Check this out. Ready for this? And kick it, and kick it. And kick it, and kick it. Very good, very nice. Now, let's get a little dirty. Let's move in, we're getting dirty. And Swayze, and Swayze, nice. And Havana Nice. Now kiss me! Hey! Wait a minute! -I'm supposed to be learning the Fox Trot. -Sorry And one-- Ah, Jackie I'm gonna miss these times with you. What do you mean you're gonna miss them? I'm not goin' anywhere. Yeah, but I am. Once Finny and I are married, we're not gonna be able to play like this. Of course we are. Stan and you were married, and we still saw each other every day and night. Except for that one night a month that you take Rosario out to get drunk and pee off the pier. I know, Jackie. But this is different. Stan was fat. Finster is thin. We're gonna be able to do a lot more things together. You know, like sit on the same bench at the same time. And see around each other. Oh So. Our friendship, as we know it, is over. But you knew that, right? Yeah, that's gonna be fun. Why did I make something I've never made before? I can't tell if this ginger chicken is done right. Needs another half-teaspoon of saffron. Oh, and the three pieces on the right need to be flipped. God, your nose is uncanny. I can only imagine how powerful it was before you had it fixed. I did not have a nose job. Would I pick this? Well, you did all the way through breakfast. I want you to give Vince a chance. I really like him. How do you know? I haven't met him yet. Just don't be judgmental, okay? Don't single out some aspect of him and then make a thing of it. -Oh, my God, does he have white stuff in the corners of his mouth? -No. -Gay face? -No. Mock turtle. -Just be open-minded. -I'm always open-minded. As long as he doesn't have a big mole on his cheek. Like I do? You should answer the door. Vince. And look, you brought presents. Grace, he brought presents. You told me to. And he's a good listener. Vince, Grace. Grace, Vince. -Nice to meet you. -Hi. I, uh, I brought you a DVD player. We busted some guys sellin' 'em out of their car. Thanks. I hear you guys get the best pot too. -You do drugs? -No. Hey, we're all gettin' along. Vince, did you bring the, uh, the article? -Uh, no. What? It's silly. -It's not silly! You're a celebrity. What article? I'm not a celebrity, Will. I'm just havin' my 15 minutes. -What'd you do? -Can I tell her? If you have to. Vince got everybody on the force to start using moisturizer on their hands. I make lotions. And now they're known as the precinct with the softest hands in town, yeah. Well, one perp even said it was like being-- being frisked by a kitten. he secret is Shea butter. You can't use too much or else the gun goes slidin' outta your hands. Learned that one the hard way. Oh, my God, you haven't even been offered a drink. How rude. I'm so sorry. Will, two wine's. So, uh, I hear you and your husband live in Brooklyn. I live on Henry Street. I only know my street. -Here we go. -Oh. Is that the famous olive tapenade? Oh, please, it's not famous. It can--it can still go to the mall and no one even tries to stop it. You said you wanted to try it. That's so sweet of you to remember. Well, it was nice of you to bring us stolen electronics. What's in this? I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. I know that's a joke, but could you not say that, since I got shot at like two hours ago. I know! I had a day too. Grace, you want some? actually, you know, I-- I don't think I can stay for dinner. What? Uh, yeah. I just--I just remembered that I have a meeting in the morning, and I forgot-- my sample books in-- in Brooklyn. -Um, so-- I'll see you tomorrow. It was so nice meeting you. -Nice to meet you Oh, wow, really, really soft. Wait, wait, wait. What just happened? Why are you leaving? What--do you not like him? No, he's nice. You two are wonderful together. I just gotta-- I-I-I gotta go. Will, I gotta take back Grace's DVD player. It's actually four kilos of cocaine. Oh, Jackie, look at me, I'm Fox Trotting! Hardly. What am I doing wrong? Look. Some people were born to dance. You were born to drink. f you could cut a rug like you lift a mug, I'd have something to work with. Honey, why are you being like this? Because, just like our friendship, this dance lesson, as we know it, is over. That's what you're upset about? -I understand you love Finny, but why do things have to change between us? -Because they have to. Every healthy relationship between a gay man and a straight woman has a sell-by date. Do you really want to end up like Will and Grace? No. So then I read the book by the redhead. You know, the one from "Taxi." She's all about food combining. But she lets you cheat on weekends. She's like, if you want it, have it. ill, what's goin' on? It's an interesting story. I'm sorry, it's just-- There is no way that Grace would walk out on a free meal just to prepare for some business meeting. This is a girl who missed her SAT's to wait for the warm donuts at Winchell's. What's the problem? I mean, I thought it went great. I-I liked her. She liked me. Yes. What--did she say somethin'? What did she say? She said you were "nice." "Nice." Nice is a bunny. -What else? -That's it. That's it? -Nothin' about my hair? -Not a word! What could she possibly have hated about you? You didn't use the word "panties," did you? 'Cause she hates that word. Will, I just met the girl. Why would I use the word "panties"? Oh There's gotta be something. And it's so weird because I really thought I liked you. Will, are you really the kinda guy who lets his best friend tell him who he can and can't date because of something as insignificant as hair or panties? Yeah, I kinda am. -What's this? -If you're here for the audition, you have to sign in. And have a naked body shot of your brother. Audition? You must be poor. Oh. Hey, Kare, what's up? Well, Finny is insisting that we do the chicken dance now in addition to the Fox Trot. Can you teach me? Ah, yes, the chicken dance. erhaps the most subtle of all dances. -Give me a minute, I'm just finishing up with Phyllis. -Who's Phyllis? I'm holding auditions for your replacement. Oh, honey, that's great. I'm proud of you. You're movin' on. Yes. America has narrowed it down to three finalists. Meanwhile, my insults to the contestants have earned me quite a following. Phyllis. Oh, by the way, if you do get the job, we're gonna have to change that name. Maybe Angie Dickenson. Or Dickie Angenson. I'll do whatever you want me to do, Jack. I just-- I really want this job. Oh, and by the way, how much does this pay? I'm expecting to clear about $150,000 a year. Plus airfare. I noticed on your résumé that you've attended the Yale School of Drama. Very, very impressive. Yes, very good. Spank it. What? Spank it. -I have a boyfriend. -Who doesn't? Spank it. Again. Harder! It's an ass, not a testicle! Oh, my! Very good. Good. You made it your own. That's what we were lookin' for. -Do you mean I get the job? -Exactly! You start immediately. Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. Don't you need to take a shower together to find out if you're compatible? No, that was the first audition. This is the call back. Okay. So, tonight, we'll go to our first gay bar and make fun of people whose stomachs are further out than their pecs. -But Jackie? What about my chicken dance? -Sorry, we're a little busy, Kare. Yeah, get lost, doll. You've been recast. Yeahof course, yeah, sure. But, uh, before I go, Phyllis, could I ask you a question? -Oh, yeah, sure. What is it? -Okay, come a little closer. It's kind of a secret. Heh heh Get the hell outta here! I don't want you seeing her anymore! What?! Why?! I can't stand the thought of you with another woman! I know I said things have to change. I know I said to move on, but, honey, just the thought of another woman spanking your fruity booty in a platonic fashion sickens me. It sickens me! That heinie's miney! Now I'll make sure to always keep you in my life if you'll make sure to always keep me in yours. Please? Dickie Angenson? I think you're very talented, and someday you'll make a gay gentleman a great date at the Oscars. But, uh, well What are you saying? You're fired. Okay, look. You obviously don't like Vince. I understand. I mean, sure his ears are a little too small for his head. And sure, he smells a little vanilla-y And--and--and, sure, from a certain angle, he looks like a hot Jerry Seinfeld. But I kinda hoped that you'd be willing to look past all that 'cause I like him. In fact, I dig him mucho! Will, I didn't notice any of those things. Really? How could you not? I mean, look at the man. Hi, it's me. Tiny-eared, vanilla Seinfeld. Wh-- You heard all that? Yeah, the ears may be tiny, but they still work. You really dig me mucho? Sí. Will, Vince is not why I left. f I don't like one of your guys, I don't just walk out. That's rude. I drag you into the bathroom and tell you what's wrong with 'em. Then, why did you leave? Ugh. I don't know, I just-- I was watching you two, and you guys looked so cute and happy and gay together. And, you know, Leo and I used to be like that. And he's coming home in a month and I don't I'm afraid that we're never gonna be like that again. It's just a little scary. So, this had nothing to do with Vince? No. I like him. Love his hair. I knew it. Oh, sweetie. I had no idea. I feel so stupid. I mean, we've been friends for 20 years. I should have known you were thinking about yourself. -Yeah, you should've. -I know ut listen, you and Leo are gonna be fine. You love each other. And, yeah, it may take a little while to get back in sync, but you'll do it. Or you won't and you'll split up. Or they will, and they'll be happy together. Or they won't. Look, Vince. Grace is fragile, okay. She needs encouragement and, and, and lies. No, Will, he's right. It may not work out. And, finally, someone has the guts to say it to me out loud. -You know, truth is, if your marriage was so great, he wouldn't have left in the first place. -Okay, too far, Vince. OK. Will, I'm ready more lies. Everything will be fine. Leo will come back. He'll sweep you off your feet. There'll be a constitutional amendment banning the mock turtleneck. And everybody will live happily ever after. God, I hope so. Okay. You two should get back to your date. I will be fine. Hey, Will, why don't we stay here? Your friend's kinda down, and my house is right around here anyway. You are so sweet to care about my friend. Really, it's just two blocks away. Then I guess you're stayin'. Come sit down. Sweetie, could-- could you and I switch so we could sit together? I'm kind of already here.   
                




                    			Look at that. Each pane cleaner than the last. Mmm. Yeah. A boy and his rag. There's nothin' sweeter. Well, with Grace out of town for a couple of days, it gives me a chance to get her snout and paw prints off of every surface. Besides, Tina's coming over. She says she needs to see me. Tina? Your father's mistress? Well, technically, she's not his mistress anymore. I mean, now my folks have broken up, she's really just his girlfriend. No, that's like saying if you were raised by wolves and then rescued by humans, you're now suddenly human. But you are human. Honey. Don't leave me alone during the breakfast rush at Jacques'. I'm workin' three stations out there, but, you've got a phone call. Who is it? - It's Elliot. Your son. - I'm not here. Jack You have to talk to him. That's the contract you made when you spent five minutes alone in the dark with a Dixie cup and a Men of General Hospital calendar. No, no, he's gonna-- he's gonna try to get me to another one of his basketball games. It's just not my thing. Make up an excuse. All right. Um, Elliot Yeah, I've got some bad news. Jack and I were figure skating and he plunged through the ice. Haven't heard from him since. Could I take a message? Okay. You're trying out for the cheerleading squad? Brr, I'm back! So, uh, Tina, what's goin' on? Oh, it's your father. I think he's seeing someone else. And I don't know why. I mean, look at me. I'm fantastic. What makes you think he's seeing someone? Ohhe's just been distracted. He's always sneaking off somewhere. And latelyevery time we try to make love, he's tired. And I'm sexual. I need it. I mean, I really, really need it. Mm. Yeah. I really need not to know that. - Will you talk to him? Find out if it's true. Please. - Oh. I have no one else to go to. I'd go to my girlfriends, but I've slept with all their husbands. Oh, that's great news. Come on by after school. I'd love to help you. And P.S., Elliot, you've just made me the proudest father in the world. Wow, cheerleading, huh? Really following in his daddy's footsteps. I remember when Stan's son first started getting fat. Stan was so proud. I only wish he'd lived to see him reach 300 pounds. So Elliot queerleading tryouts, huh? Cheerleading. Yeah. Well, we'll see what the kids are calling you when they're stuffing you in your locker on Monday. Okay, Elliot. So what are your guidelines? I was thinking of making you all up in Kabuki like Madonna in her "Frozen" video. Right, well I was thinking a simple cheer and dressed as a guy is probably a better way to go. My locker's very small. Why you ungrateful little piece of street trash! I oughta-- We must encourage him no matter how deep the shame runs. So it says here for the audition, you need to come up with your own cheer. Okay, so why don't you show me what you got, and we'll just change it all to my stuff later. Okay. I'vegotschoolspirit. I've gotschool spirit. Why you talentless, tone deaf sack of-- You're not helping. Sit. I know it stinks. That's why I'm here. I need your help, Jack. Okay, we can do this. What are your ideas? ^What do you think this cheer should be? I don't know. They just said to come up with something good that shows enthusiasm. Okay, good and enthusiastic. Let's let that roll around. And it's rolling around. And it's rolling around. Good and enthusiastic. Not too on the nose. And stop. I've got it. Boy, are we enthusiastic. We are feelin' G-O-O-D. Boy, are we enthusiastic. We are feelin' G-O-O-D. Good and be enthusiastic! You see? Yeah. That--that's pretty good. Thank you. Now. Let's add a little bit of this. All right, ready? When I say "go," you say "fight." - Go. - Fight. - Go. - Fight. - When I say "when," you say "tonight." When. - Tonight. - When. - Tonight. - Go-o-o team! Go team! - Okay, great! Excellent! I've never been more attracted to you than I am right now. Dad, it's Will. Can we talk for a sec? Dad, I know you're home. Look, I don't care that-- that you're with someone. You're--you're single. You can do what you want. You're--you're Ben Affleck right now. Only without all the extra breakup weight. - So, look, whoever you're with in there, it's fine by me. I just want to say that as far as-- - Hello, Will. - Mom! What's going on? Where's Dad? - He's in the shower. In the sh-- You're the other woman?! You're the one that Dad's sneaking around with? You and Dad are--are-- You know thinging. Will, we're adults. Let's talk like adults. Your father and I are making pookie-pookie. How did this happen? I mean, like, I know how this happens. You showed me when I was 10 with two of my G.I. Joes. I'm not saying that that led to anything, I just How did this happen? Well, a few months ago, I ran into your father, and we decided to have a drink. Oh, it was fun. - He made me laugh. We caught up, and, you know, one thing led to another and before I knew it-- - You don't have to finish that. Pookie-pookie. Well, I guess in a way, this is good news. You know, I mean, you and Dad are back together. I'll only have to make one hand-print ashtray at Christmas-time. There you go. Who's pretty when he smiles? I am. - Hey. - So? How'd it go? Wait, wait, wait. Before you say anything, I'd like to present you with these pom poms. They were your grandfather's. Go, Elliot! Go, Elliot! - I didn't get it. - What? - Why you miserable, worthless-- - Karen! What happened? I stunk. All the girls laughed at me. I'm gonna graduate a virgin. Wha--I don't understand. Did you do this? - Yes. - What about this? - Yes. - Well, did you do this? Yeah, I did all that stuff. They just didn't like me. Hey, did you do this? Oooooh La la la la la ooooh whee-e-e ooooh. Whoo! No. Well, you should try it. It's fun. You know, maybe I should go out for track. Might as well. Once word gets out I tried out for cheerleading, I'll be running a lot anyway. Whoa-ho. Whoa. No. Let me tell you something, Mister. My family has had four generations of male cheerleaders. And I ain't gonna do nothin' to break that up. All right? So I'm gonna go talk to the powers that be, and make sure they know we are a serious force to be reckoned with! Karen! My pom poms! Boy, are we enthusiastic. Grace, it's great. My mom and dad are back together, you know? And I-- I-I feel kinda bad for Tina, but then again, she is the one that kinda broke up the marriage, so I-- Are you peeing while I'm talking to you?! Yeah, I did one time, but at least I had the courtesy to-to-to do it silently around the edge of the bowl! Look, I-- I gotta go. Just, please, just this once for me, remember to wash your hands. - Oh, hi. Tina. - Hello, Will. - Come on in. - Oh. So um How have you been, Will? - Not bad. I, uh-- I kinda had a weird moment last night-- - Will! I really don't care. I just want to know what you found out. Oh. Um I'm afraid I have some bad news. Then, why are you smiling? Oh, that--that's just something that I do when I give bad news. Um, people tell me it comforts them. Oh How often do you give bad news? Twice today, already. Yeah. A good friend of mine died. So, um Listen I went to see my-- my Dad, and, uh yeah, yeah, he is seeing someone else. I think it's serious. I'm--I'm sorry. Oh. Okay. You know this is what I thought. Oh! I'm so stupid. When am I ever gonna find a married man who's faithful to me? I don't suppose you found out who she is, did you? I meanthe otherwoman. - Does it really matter? - Ah! You're right. She's probably some whore! Or not. One thing I do know is that he's-he's not gonna leave her. So, you know, just move on. Forget about him. You know, you-- you got a killer body. You love sex. Who's not gonna snap that up? Yeah, you're right. To hell with him! I-I deserve better than this. You know, I was voted most confident in my low self-esteem support group. - I hope he gets an STD from that whore! - Or not. Go, Wolverines, Go! Go, Wolverines, Go! Jack, I didn't make the squad. Let it go. No, I won't let it go. If I learned anything from seeing Gypsy fifty times, it's to push your children to hate you and never want to speak to you again. Now, which one's the head cheerleader? The blonde. Her name is Melanie. And I kinda have a crush on her, so please don't embarrass me. Don't worry. Melanie! - Yes, can I help you? - I believe you can. Yes. How old is someone like you? 25? Ever been in a limo? I'm Elliot's father. Okay? That boy can cheer. Okay? He comes from a long, proud line of cheerleaders. His great-grandfather came to this country with nothing but a tattered pom pom in his hand, and a dream that one day he'd see his children stacked in a perfect pyramid. And now, you're telling me you're gonna deny my son his heritage? Refuse him his birthright? Well, yeah! He sucked. - See, Jack, I told you. - Shush it! - We are not leaving until you give him another chance. - Come on, Elliot, we'll do it with you. Hold my drink, Heather. And I know how much is in it, so no sippies. - Ready. Okay. - Hi, Cowboys. Hi, Sailors. - Hi, musclemen and cops. Our team is called the Wolverines and you know our boys-- I can't do this! I don't want to be a cheerleader. I never wanted to be one! School spirit! What is going on? What are you talking about? The only reason I did this is so you would pay attention to me. You don't care about anything I do. You don't care about basketball, and you don't care about skateboarding. We-we both like Vin Diesel movies. Yes, for very different reasons. Do you know how humiliating it was for me to try out for cheerleading? But I was willing to do that to spend time with you. I didn't know it meant that much to you, Elliot. Why do you think I call you every Friday night to come to my basketball games? You know what? Forget it. You can't understand. No. I do. I do understand. My dad did the same thing to me. When I was a kid, I set up a little manicure stand at the end of my street. I did a pretty good business with a couple neighbor ladies and the divorcees from the next town over. But the only customer I ever really wanted was my dad. Every day, I'd watch him come home from work, and I pray that he'd stop. But he never did. And I'd think to myself, "Why? Why? What kind of man doesn't want a roadside manicure from his own son?" I can't believe I repeated that cycle with you. - Well, you did. - Well, I'm sorry, Elliot. - I'd let you give me a manicure. - You would? - Yeah. - You're the best. Thanks, Elliot. And I promise I'll start coming to your basketball games. And I'll say to everyone, "That's my son, the one whose nails match his jersey!" Yeah. You don't need to say that to everyone. - Will! We have to talk. - Mom! What if I'd come out here wearing nothing? You mean it's possible to wear less than you're wearing right now? I'll have you know skirts are shorter this year. What did you say to that woman? - Nothing! The-the truth. I didn't mention you, but I-I did say that Dad's been seeing someone. - Ah, Will, that's just perfect. You've ruined everything. Momlet's just sit down and talk about this. - Uh-oh. - Let's just stand up and talk about this. Will, thanks to you, Tina's dumped him. Well, that's great. With Tina gone, you and dad can get back together, the way you used to be. You know, with the-the joint showers and pookie-pookie. Are you out of your head? Don't you understand why he cheated on me in the first place? Well, sure, because you stopped communicating. The-the whole basis of your marriage started to slowly erode. No. It was fun. Cheating is fun! Ooh, the secret little meetings, and-and you only have an hour and then, you gotta hide the evidence. Ooh, gosh, I felt like a spy. - I felt like a sexual spy On a--on a mission to-- - You don't have to finish that. - Seduce the enemy with my body. - And she finished it. Now, but thanks to you, the meddler in the mini-robe, that's all over. Yeah, I just feel like we're married again, only now I have to pay for my own clothes. - So what do you want me to do? - Fix it! No! I-I-I I'm staying out of this. You know, just-just- call one of your other sons. Oh, your brothers can't help me. They're straight. They have no finesse for the-- for the details of manipulating petty dramas. Gee, what a sweet way of voicing your support for your gay son. Will-- Oh my God, you're nude! Yeah, we've done all the robe jokes, move on. I was packing my stuff at George's apartment, and I found a note. The whore is your mother. Meet my mother. Whore, mistress. Mistress, whore. Well, um, hi, Marilyn. We finally meet. Though I've seen pictures of you when I removed them from your ex-husband's wallet. Well, I must say, you're almost exactly as I imagined you. You're like page four in the Midlife Crisis catalog. Okay, ladies. Let's relax and sit. - Oh. - Let's stand. We have a very complicated problem here. A lot of competing agendas. But as a lawyer, I'm used to working on tricky corporate mergers. So I'm sure we can find some common ground. Mom, what is it you want? Well, I want Tina to keep seeing George. So he can sneak around with me behind her back. You're quite the role model. Tina? Well, I want Marilyn out of the picture, so I can have George all to myself. I mean, this is the first time I've ever dated a man that I didn't have to call, let it ring once, and call back. So that was you at Thanksgiving? So what we're looking for is a solution that encompasses all these needs. Uh, Will, when you gesture like that, we can see your Pennsylvania. However, that solution does not exist. So let's get to what I want. Otherwise known as what's gonna happen. Tina, move on. You're gonna be miserable at first, but you'll live. Mom, you are gonna get back with Dad. You're gonna be miserable at first, but you'll live. - Are we clear on this? - Um, yes. I guess so. Good. Now we're all behaving like ladies. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna drink half a bottle of chardonnay, and scrub myself until I feel clean again. - We're not gonna listen to him, are we? - No, the three of us had a great thing going. - So I'll take George Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. - And I'll keep him on the weekends. We'll give him Tuesdays and Thursdays to rest. Ohh, this is great! And it's even more exciting now that we're lying to Will. Ooh, and here's another. This is your great-grandpappy, Liam McFarland, leading a cheer squad. That's quite a split. - And that was before stretch pants. - Yeah, I can see that. Oh, talk about courageous. When the Yanks landed in Okinawa, he was right there alongside them, yelling, "Fight, fight." And after the war, that brave man cheered with one arm. How does that make you feel, boy? If I say proud, can I go home?   
                




                    			Jack, wake up. Jack? -Oh, no, I think there's a tickle bug in the couch. -Not a tickle bug! Not a tickle bug! Not a tickle bug! What's going on? Why am I in your apartment? What did you do to me? Oh, God. Please tell me I put up at least a token show of resistance. Relax, we all went out clubbing last night. You had two light beers, got the hiccups, and made us carry you home. All I remember is a strange man putting his hand down my khakis. Yeah, that was you. Oh, hi. Wow, I can't remember the last time I was out that late. I know. It was wild. I fell into bed without even flossing. We're kind of like rock stars. Well, morning boys. I see we paired off last night. Ooh-hooh. That Grace is a tigress. Girl sure knows how to put a smile in a lady's pants. Karen, Grace passed out the minute she hit the pillow. Nothing happened between you two. Well That's not what it says on your bathroom wall. Which reminds me, stop writing on my bathroom wall. It took me three weeks to scrub off "I heart Mescaline." Hey, now, I'm hearing a lot of words and none of them are "Jack." Remember, this weekend's all about me. I'm the one graduating from nursing school tomorrow. You're right. And we're very proud of you. But I've been meaning to ask you, it's been five months. How on Earth are you graduating already?! Oh, I had 16 credits from my vacation in Mexico. Yeah, I clouded over the first few days, so I decided to take a few courses from the local medical school. I don't know what they were, because I don't speak Spanish. But, uh, they were handing those credits out like candy. I think some of them even may have been candy. Well, thanks for clearing that up. And remind me the next time I have to go to the emergency room, we're going to Canada. Well, poodle, I haven't forgotten that your graduation is tomorrow. That's why I have planned a whole day of beauty for you. They'll be manies and pedies, gentlemen's facials, and when you least expect it a colonic. Oh, don't forget. I have to make time to write my speech. I was voted most popular, so I get to speak at the ceremony. hat's some school you're graduating from. Take credits from a Cancun vacation, most popular gives the speech. Stay one more week, maybe you'll get your pilot's license. Look, you guys. Look it. My name's even on the invitation. See, "Commencement address by most popular student nurse, Jack McFarland." That's me! Uh, poodle, do you notice anything strange about this invitation? Oh, my God, they spelled my name wrong! No, they didn't. Then what? Well, it says the ceremony's on Saturday, not Sunday. Today is Saturday. Oh, my God, I must've read it wrong. Oh, no. Oh, my God! God, I haven't seen him run like that since he wore Capezios in the Bronx. Hurry up, Will! I know it's a challenge. You're probably not used to working with this much hair. Yeah, well, we'd be a lot further ahead if you hadn't insisted we try the "Rachel" first. Will, I tried to wake Grace, but she's sleeping like a log. And there's ants on her, and she's lying in a shallow pool of water. Forget about her. We'll wake her later. She only needs like three minutes anyway. Two swipes of Right Guard and a stick of Trident, she's good to go for any occasion. Okay, Jackie. Let's suit up. I stole this out of Will's closet. Why does he have a Peter Pan outfit in there? We went to Sandy Duncan's yard sale. Yeah, I picked up a "Hogan Family" crew jacket for just ten bucks. Fags are a hoot. this fits a little snug. ut that's impossible. Will's like three times my size. Here, I'll just do one button. Maybe that'll help. Darn it! It's still too tight! What's going on?! Poodle, it's nothing to worry about. It's probably just monthly bloat. I just got mine, and now you're getting yours. You know, when gals hang around together as much as we do they tend to sync up. At least there's a reason for it. Hey, is that my jacket? Looks a little tight on you. Hey, why you frontin'? I could fit two of me in one of your Marlon Brando size jackets. Nonsense. Oh, gosh. I'm proud of our little boy. Graduating from school. Could I be honest with you, Will? I've always thought that Jack was an idiot. Well, now that idiot will hold other people's lives in the palm of his hand. Will, can I kiss you? All right. Hey, lookin' good. Pants look a little tight, though. No, they're not. And stop trying to project your morbid obesity onto me. Okay. Guess I've been wearing them wrong. You know, buttoning and zipping them all these years. All right, we're dressed, we're coiffed. You had your surprise colonic. And you were right, Karen. I did not see that coming. Nor I. Now all you need is your speech. Oh, my God, I forgot to write my speech! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh--! Jack, Jack. Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack. It's okay. You can do this. Just talk about why you got into nursing. I don't know why. I just kind of stumbled into it. I'm not like you. You've always wanted to be a lawyer. Ever since you were an angry, argumentative baby in pin-striped diapers. That's not true. I actually started out as a playwright, and then I went into law. Playwright?! You talkin' about that stupid little play you wrote about being pimply and closeted? For your information, that "stupid little play" was my coming out story, Bye-Bisexual. That play was genius. You--you-- My playwrighting professor, Craig, even said so. He told me that I was a great writer, and any man would be lucky to have me. He even took me to a wine bar and then back to his apartment to discuss it. Wait. o you wrote a bad play, and you were molested. Welcome to the theater. Can we get back to my speech, please? I only have an hour. You know, I think I may still have a copy of Bye-Bisexual in a satin box with all of Craig's letters. So, Karen, what should be in my speech? I want it to be memorable. It should have a catch phrase like "I have a dream" or "Whoomp, there it is." Well Why don't you write about how you wanted to become a nurse because you love helping people. Good one, Karen. Come on, Karen. Be serious. How does anybody know why they do what they do? Well, Jackie, let me tell you my story. Maybe it'll inspire you. Now God didn't give me the ability to play the piano, or paint a picture, or have compassion. But he did give me the ability to crack a walnut with my hoo-ha. Really? Here, let me show you. Got it! Boy, are you guys in for a treat. Listen to this poetry, even in the opening stage direction. "Darkness, a sliver of light finds its way upon the stage and lands on a dark chair. Because it is somewhat dark, we cannot see the whole chair. More light appears and inhabits the entire chair. Now we can see it. A dark chair on a dark stage with some light. Dim." Jackie, could you beat me over the head with that candlestick until I black out and die? You wouldn't know good writing if it slapped you in the face. Jackie, once I'm dead, could you see to it that I'm slapped in the face? Come on, it gets better after the, uh, first five pages of stage directions. Here, here, here. "Chad, evasively: I don't know why I don't have a girlfriend, Dad. I-I guess I just haven't met the right--dot, dot, dot--person yet. But when I meet that--beat--person, I'll introduce you to--beat--them. Then he addresses the audience. "There is no them. Them is he. I'm gay! Why can't I tell anyone?" God, this is awful. I know, it should've been called Bye-Bye Talent. That's a good one. I can't believe this. All these years, I really thought I had talent. It's--it's one of the main reasons I feel superior to people. Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. You were only 18. That's like the ninth grade. -Hey, I bet if you tried writing now, with all your life experience and maturity, you'd be a hell of a lot better. -I don't know. Sure you would. Hey. Why don't you take a crack at writing my speech, huh? Yeah, I bet when I read it, if people are moved, you'll know you really do have something. That's not a bad idea. I could write it in the limo. Yeah, honey, why don't you go grab your lucky pen? -How do you know I have a lucky pen? -Your kind always does. Ha ha! Did you see that, Karen? Did you see how I tricked Will into doing my speech by pretending to care about his writing? I did. Honey, I was proud of you. Hey, can I be honest with you, Karen? I've always thought Will was an idiot. Oh, my God, honey! I just said the same thing about you a minute ago. Hello! Reason we're friends! Speech, speech. So, uh, Jack, what was the inciting incident that got you into nursing? Well I met a cute guy in a nurse's outfit and followed him into the bathroom. Okay, inquisitive. "Always had an inquisitive nature." Go on. And then I looked over the stall and said "good for you." "Always had an appreciation of anatomy." Now, were there any nurses that influenced you growing up? That would probably have to be Diahann Carroll on "Julia." And a nurse. You know, I worked with Diahann on my two-episode arc of "Dynasty." Yeah, couldn't remember her blocking. Okay, how 'bout something like this? "Welcome. Picture this. A child in front of a television set fascinated by nurses saving lives. -Picture this. The child grown older now. Inquisitive. Now, picture this--" -Honey, picture this. This emery board going into your eye. All right, let me read what I have so far. "I wasn't always a nurse, you know. I was an actor, then a cater waiter, then an actor, then a cater waiter, then a singer, then an actor, then a cater waiter. " What do you think? Will, I don't know if this helps you or not. But while I was in nursing school, I was a cater waiter. Ooh, okay. How 'bout this? "It's like I was born to serve others." -Honey, you're on to something. -Ooh, I like it too. Just add the word "chicken" on the end of the sentence. Hey, it's Rosario. Driver, pull over. Hi, honey. You look good. I like those knee-highs. Are they opaque? -Forget it. You're not getting my hoagie. -Then nobody does. -Uh, did you get my wrist corsage? -Yes, I did. Oh, thank you. God, could you imagine if I graduate without any flowers on my wrist? I'd be the laughing stock of all the nurses in all the land. Okay. I think I got it. You ready? What's going on? Oh. Let me get you up to speed. I own you. And what we're doing is none of your business. Lady, don't be surprised if your martinis smell of Clorox tonight. Hey, hey, hey, guys. Come on. Okay, now, when you step up to the podium, make sure you have everybody's attention. Then you begin. "Friends, parents, and classmates, today I'd like to talk to you about what it means to follow your heart " "And it's no coincidence that nurses, like angels, wear white." What do you think? It's really good. Yeah? Wh--what about you guys? Will, can I kiss you again? Hurt so good. Come on, baby, make it hurt so good. Sometimes love don't feel like it should. You make it, ugh, ugh, hurt so good. This school is accredited, right? Oh, my God, I'm next. I'm so nervous. I wish I had a prop. Does anybody have a parasol and two spoiled English children? Honey, you don't need any props. Just open with an insensitive racial remark. They love it. No! No props, no remarks. Just trust the words. Do it like you did it in the limo. People will love you. Here, I've put marks where you should hold for laughs or tears. -There's a mark in every line. -Thank you, thank you. Ooh, nice looking crowd. Hello there. Aah! Stampede! Ha ha. The first time I heard that, I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur. I wasn't supposed to introduce the next person, but Audrey bailed. She said it was a family emergency, but to me, that's code for vag problems. -I think I speak for all of us -Ooh, my God, I just realized we forgot to wake up Grace. Should I call her? Honey, if you were at home missing this, would you want someone to call you? I know. But I want her to hear my speech. Well, you can read it to her later, honey, when you're moisturizing her. -If you want to just talk -You're right. So I gave him a shove out the window. It wasn't like I was trying to kill him. Anyway, I think it's time to turn over the podium to this year's most popular student nurse, Jack McFarland. Friends, parents, and classmates, today I would like to talk to you about what it means to follow your heart. They say dreams are like soap. If you don't hold on tight, they'll slip away. A man who has let go of his dream is like a child who has let go of his balloon. -I thought dreams were like soap. -Dreams can be more than one thing. We are all here today because we refused to let go. I've always dreamed of the day when I would become a nurse. Pausing Good. Ever since I was a child, I knew this is what I was meant to be That's not a pause. That's where your voice breaks with emotion. You know what? I can't do this. These aren't my words. No, don't give me credit now. Do it later with a champagne toast. This is wrong. I didn't write this speech. And you know why? Because I couldn't think of any reasons why I wanted to be a nurse, because it wasn't my dream. I wanted to be an actor. But I let it slip away from me like a soapy balloon. But standing here in front of all of you right now, reading words I don't believe and don't really understand makes me realize I still want to be an actor. I had no idea he felt like that. I love acting! I love the attention and the applause. When you're a nurse, the patient gets all the attention. No. This is not what I want. I'm sorry. I cannot live a lie. No! We didn't make a copy! I'll say it again fags really are a hoot. Honey, you did the right thing. I hope so. KAREN: You did. And I could not be prouder. Hey, you're gonna be a big star. You're gonna make it big. And I'm glad that you took this diploma, 'cause you're gonna need it when you fall flat on your ass. Hey, you're gonna make it big. And when you don't, you'll have a degree. So, you go out there and you be an actor. Until you're a nurse. Thanks, Kare. You know, now that I've made this decision, I like a weight has been lifted off of me. I think this suit actually fits. -No, it doesn't. -I said it fits! Change of subject! Will. I feel terrible. I know he wanted so badly to hear his speech performed. Honey, she'll be fine. She doesn't care about that speech. All she cares about is you. That's right. You're what's important to her. As long as you're happy, she's happy. Where is she anyway? And never forget: Dreams are like feathers if you have enough, you can fly. Wow. Maybe I will get back into porn.   
                




                    			So, Karen, I can't believe you're doing this. Eloping to Vegas. It's so romantic. Taking your sacred vows in the city of water slides and titty bars. What happened to the big fall wedding you were planning? You know, the three thousand people in St. Patrick's Cathedral. Did-did the walls start bleeding when you walked in? I don't know, honey. We were doing all that wedding planning and all the sudden, Lyle just said, "Hey! Screw it. Let's go to Vegas and get married." He loves Caesar's Palace. There's a little salsa there. God, this plane is fantastic! Thanks, honey. You know, I am only travelling like this from now on. How much does it cost to charter a plane like this for the weekend. Two-hundred and seventy thousand dollars. You know what else is fantastic? JetBlue. So this is fun. Yeah. I haven't been on your plane since we flew down to Mexico to smuggle in some new staff for you. Hee hee! Grace is going to be so jealous she missed this. - Why is she missing this? - Oh. Work. She's designing a sex room for one of the gals from "The View." She can meet us in Vegas tomorrow. Yeah, Leo's gonna meet us there, too. Oddly, Cambodia and New York, no direct flights. Cambodia, Vegas, four shuttles a day. Yeah. It's gonna be their big romantic reunion. I still don't think it's fair. Why does Grace get to bring her husband, and we don't get to bring our boyfriends? Oh, come on, honey, you know what would happen. You gals would get all misty-eyed at my wedding, wanna do it yourselves and put me in the awkward position of having to come out against gay marriage. You know, that would piss me off if you weren't giving us this free trip. Oh, sorry, darling. I'm really not sure about this. You know, I get petrified about flying. Oh, darling, I feel bad. I just took the last 12 Xanax. I know it's childish of me, but I just have this vision of the plane going out of control and smashing into the side of the mountain. Ah, listen to me prattling away. I should just get into the cockpit and have us cleared for takeoff. Enjoy your flight, everyone. Ladies and Gentlemen, if you look off the right side of the plane, you can see the mighty Mississippi, celebrated in literature and song. And off the left side, you can see-- Bloody hell, another plane. Hang on, everyone! Okay, kids, here are your packets. Everything you need once we hit Vegas. Show tickets, mad money, and if you wanna get some sun by the pool, I threw in a thong and a razor for your ass. I'm gonna hit the blackjack tables. I learned how to play on my last gay cruise. I got pretty good too. They called me the "BJ Kid." I hope it was 'cause of the blackjack. Are you gonna play, Jack? Oh--No. All that "hit me, hit me" gets me excited for all the wrong reasons. You know, we could play as a team. Maximize our winnings, minimize our loses. That's what I did on the gay cruise. Guys wanted to team up with me all the time. I'd get calls in the middle of the night just asking for the BJ Kid. Gosh, I'm starving. Where is that lazy-ass stewardess? Okay, here we go. Warm nuts. Warm nuts. Warm nuts. Get your mind out of the gutter. They're just nuts. Well, looks like everything's all set for the wedding. Flowers, clean needles, Jordan almonds Hey, what's this "light beer" on here? Well, I figured out how the auto-pilot works. Finally, after two weeks of flying, ha! Darling, what's with this light beer? Oh, I like light beer. I got two going in the cockpit right now. We can't have light beer at my wedding. It's tacky. And I've got these two fags here who are gonna be judging everything I do. - It's true. - Well, I want light beer. - Well, I don't. - All right, well, we'll discuss this when we get to Miami. Vegas. Oh, dear. Sheesh. Can you believe him? Light beer. What's next? Non-addictive painkillers? Karen, marriage is about compromise. You know, maybe you just let him have this one. Yeah, in the big scheme of things is it really that important? I mean, it's beer. It's not like something crucial like the mini crab cakes. Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm making too much of it. He can have his beer. Oh, and, Will, uh, we decided against the mini crab cakes. We're going with the chicken sauté. Ah, Vegas. I can't wait to go gambling. I mean, sure I may lose 100 grand. But the drinks are free, it all evens out. I'm just sorry that my daughter couldn't attend our wedding. And Lorraine could be making so much money on the out-of-towners. I know. Who would have thought that there could be such an aggressive strain of herpes that it could keep you from flying. Yeah. Anyway, thanks so much, darling, for agreeing to get married here. Well, you know, I'd do anything for you. Except for what I did last night. That was just a one time thing. Lah-ba-da, bee-ba-da Hi, Mrs. Walker. Mark Juliano, I'm the president of Caesars Palace. Is there anything I can do for you? Well, uh, yes, actually. I understand that Celine Dion works for you. I was wondering if you could have her sent up to our room later to give us foot massages. She doesn't do that. - How 'bout Elton John? - Well, he might. I'll ask. Ah-ba-da, Bee-ba-da, Doopity-doopity-doo Look, Lyle. I think I recognize those two from New York. Isn't it awkward when you meet someone on the plane and then keep bumping into them the whole trip? I have a big surprise for Grace and Leo when they get here. I upgraded their room. And I sent champagne and had them sprinkle rose petals on their bed. Well, they didn't have rose petals, so French fries. I figured that would get Grace into bed faster. Why are you playing Cupid with them? Is it 'cause you're chubby and five minutes away from a diaper? Hey. They haven't seen each other in six months. I just want their romantic reunion to be special. You know, when they're standing in that beautiful room, looking into each other's eyes, I want them to think, "I love Will." Ooh, that reminds me. I have to get condoms. Yes! And that is why they call me the BJ Kid. Heh. I hope. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Damn it, I shoulda stayed at 19! Ah, go ahead, Will, kick me off your team. I stink at this. I'm like a bad luck charm. A big ol' jinx. No, no, no, we are in this together. Who cares if one guy's down 240 and the other guy's up 650? That still leaves the team with 410 dollars. Minus the $100 initial investment. That's a $310 profit in a 45 minute period. Explain that to me again without the numbers and pat my head. You don't have to do any of the thinking. Just sit there and look pretty. Oh, thanks, buddy. You always look out for me. Oh, cut that out. You wanna get us all killed? I'm as corny as Kansas in August, High as the flag on the Fourth of July. If you'll excuse an expression I use I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a wonderful guy! Yeah, well, it'll never last. Jennifer Lopez? Shh. Please, I'm on vacation. Can I just get a hand towel and a pack of Chicklets? What?! Honey, I don't work here. Oh, I'm sorry. You know, you see a white girl in a bathroom, you just assume. No, honey, don't you remember? I'm Karen. We met through Rosario. You guys used to take tap together in the Bronx way back when. Oh! Rosie! God, I haven't seen her since we performed "Tea for Two" at the Shalom Retirement Center. How is she doing? Is she still working on her Masters? Yeah, she sorta got a little sidetracked. So, uh, keeping yourself busy these days? No, kinda taking it easy. You know, promoting my fragrance. Uh, shooting a movie in L.A. Working on a new line of track suits. And studying for my real estate license. Do you rent or own? Honey, I own everyone. Great, well, since you're not up to much, you wanna sing at my wedding tonight? Ooh, tonight? UhI'm opening the restaurant. Mixing a new CD. Uh, finishing my novel. So Okay! Besides, it'll be great to see Rosario. Does she still wear all those colorful outfits? Yeah, she's, uh sort of in a gray phase right now. Well, I guess I'll see you tonight. Oh, and don't tell my manager. He'll want ten percent. Well, here we are, three single men in Vegas. What sort of trouble are we gonna get ourselves into tonight? - We were gonna go to Chippendales. - Oh, I'll see you at the wedding. Darling, great news. While I was in the crapper, I found a singer for our reception. Oh, super, I can't wait to dance the first dance as Mr. and Mrs. Lyle Finster. What?! I ain't changing my name. I like my name. - Carol-- - Karen. - Texas Ranger. - Walker. But, darling, if you don't take my name, all the chaps at the gardening club will think me unmanly. Yeah, well, forget about it. Ain't gonna happen. Fine, well, let the castrating commence, eh? Can you believe him? Wanting me to change my name. I've had that name my entire life! Well, Karen, actually Walker was Stan's name. Before that you were Popeil and St. Croix. Your real name's Delaney. Oh, right. Zany Delaney. But I don't wanna go back to that, and I don't wanna give him this either. But don't you need to change your name every few years to throw the Feds off? That's true. And it would be a lot easier than sandpapering off my fingerprints. Well, all right. I'll give him this one too. Damn it! Busted again. Yay, 21! - Thank God we're a team 'cause I am down to my last 10 dollars. - Yeah, about that, the team's over. I'm rich! Can I get you guys to squeeze in a little closer together? How blessed am I that I get to share this wonderful occasion with the people that I love the most? Cheese! All right, now one without the queers. - Are you still mad at me, Will? - No, Jack, I'm not a child. I don't hold silly grudges. Oh, good. 'Cause look what I bought with my winnings. - Wow, nice. - Yeah, and it tells the time in every time zone. I wonder what time it is on the sidewalk. Karen, did you just see what Will did? Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Would it help if I played with your breasts for awhile? Whoo. La la la la. Hey, weren't you two doing that when I left? - Hey! - Honey, Look! - It's Leo! - Ooh, somebody lost some weight. - Ah, thank you. It was me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get my watch back from that guy before the ambulance takes him away. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. Hey, guys. - Oh, hey, Leo. - Hey, Karen. Hi, Leo Markus. Lyle Finster. You know, I've heard so much about you. Karen says that you have all the qualities she looks for in a man. SoI guess you own a bottle opener. Keep it on my belt. Honey, now, could you get out of our picture? I don't mean to be offensive. But, uh, this is a Gentiles-only photograph. Ha ha. Grace can't wait to see you. You're all she talked about for four months. Oh, Grace didn't call ya? Oh, she's not coming. She threw her back out installing a rubber swing for one of the ladies on "The View." I can't tell you which one, but it's not the one you think. Well, that's terrible. That means the insurance will go up on all our rubber swings. So wait, wait, she's not coming at all? We were gonna get our hair blown out together. Oh, Will, this must be so painful for you. Wait a minute! Wait a minute, what am I supposed to do? I can't get married without my best girl. We're gonna have to postpone! No, we can't postpone. I want to start my new life with you right now. Darling, so do I. Okay, come on, let's do it. Besides, I'll have lots of other weddings that Grace can come to. Let's go get our pictures taken in the Jacuzzi. Well You must be so bummed she's not here. Hey, come on. Let's call her. Yeah, we'll do something cute. Like talk in chipmunk voices or do a comical rap. - Come on, let's call her. - Hey, hey, you know what? Let's call her later. I'm dying to go gambling. You know, I got 112,000 in Cambodia money. That's almost four bucks of fun. I can't tell you how proud I am to be part of your special day. Oh, well, you are a part of it, Rosie. That's why I want you to walk into that chapel, get down on your hands and knees with some Endust and a shammy and makes those floors shine. You said I was your bridesmaid. No. I said you're the bride's maid. Now get! Darling, I want you to meet my brother, Marion. - Pleasure. - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. - Marion. - One more time. - Marion. - Ha ha ha ha, I'm sorry. I keep hearing "Marion." Well, may I say on behalf of all the Finsters, welcome to the family. I've always wanted a sister. Whoa, congratulations, brother. Okay. See you in the chapel. Boy. Your brother sure can kiss. That's nothing. Wait 'til you meet my dad. Psst. Will. Since Grace isn't here, Karen would like you to read this at the wedding. This is a profile of Amy Brenneman from TV Guide. - Yeah, but look what she says about love. - Awww! Hey there, hockey pucks. What is this, a moron convention? Sorry, I just came from the Don Rickles show at the Stardust. - Are you drunk? - Little bit. It's Vegas, baby. What's the matter with you? Karen's gonna be drunk. You don't pull focus from the bride. I-I-I'm sorry. I've been in Cambodia. It's been awhile since I had a drink that wasn't mixed with bacteria. I said "bacteria." All the way from "Doctors without Humor." Listen, I talked to Karen, and she said if you wanna take her plane back to New York, you're welcome to it. You know, it's just gonna be sitting there 'til Thursday, when it has to bring arms to Panama. I don't know, you know. I'm having fun. Did I mention, it's Vegas, baby? Yeah, but you can be with Grace in less than four hours. What? And miss Karen's wedding. I love Karen. And you know who else I love? You. Okay, what the hell is going on here? Jackie, I'm so happy. And you know, you were right. Marriage is about compromise. - I gave up a lot, but I got stuff too. - Like what, Kare? Well, Lyle wanted me to walk down the aisle to "Here Comes the Bride." But then I told him that ever since I was a little girl, I have dreamed that at my fourth wedding I would walk down the aisle to "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones. And he went for it. That's great. But weren't you saving "Sympathy for the Devil" for your fifth wedding? Honey, that would be in bad taste. Fifth wedding is traditionally "Smack My Bitch Up" by Prodigy. No, really, why don't you wanna see your wife? - Back off, all right. It's none of your business. - It is my business. She's my best friend. - What is going on with you? - I'm just not ready to see her yet. - Why? I don't wanna talk about this right now. What the--?! Leo, tell me. - Drop it. We're in the middle of a wedding. - Not until you tell me what the hell is going on. I kissed someone, okay. I kissed someone when I was in Cambodia. Here comes the bride. And she is pissed. You know, I am very angry with you. I didn't say anything until now because we were busy consummating our marriage in the cloak room. You promised that we would walk down the aisle to "Sympathy for the Devil." I took an executive decision. You don't get to be president of a company that sells rat traps to breweries without being able to think on your feet. Lyle, that was very important to me. Let it go, woman. We're just about to have our first dance. I am not speaking to you. Just did. - I mean from here on. - Still doing it. - Starting now. - That counts. - Agh! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am your host for this evening, Jack McFarland. Hello. And to honor those of you who have traveled so far from Great Britain to be with us here tonight, I'll be translating my remarks into English. And now for their first dance as husband and wife And now, for their first donce as husband and wife Please welcome to the fabulous Caesars ballroom Please welcome to the fabulous Caesars bollroom Mr. and Mrs. Lyle Finster. Mr. and Mrs. Lordy-loo Bumbershoot. Everyone applauds darling, we're a hit. Don't you try to make nice with me. I am furious at you! I adore you. Don't change the subject. I could swim in your bosom for months. Keep talking. I could flop on your flesh for minutes. Oh, Lyle. How can I stay mad at you? Not when you repeat our wedding vows. At this point in the evening, we'd like to invite everybody else on to the dance floor, okay? Unless your thighs rub together when you walk. Then, you can sit tight for the cake. - May I cut in? - Oh, how lovely. It's so touching that you're wearing Mother's suit on your wedding day. Well, well, well. Even at her own wedding, still sad and alone. Ah, Beverley Leslie. What a treat. I'm so glad I put you in the overhead compartment now. I am so sorry I missed the ceremony. But tell me this, darling, do they still say "'til death do us part" when the bride is a vampire? Darling, it's all right that you missed it. Probably just as well. There was some children there, and they get frightened when something your size isn't covered in Muppet fur. - Shall we dance? - I'd love to. Hop on my feet. There you are. You just drop this bomb on me about kissing someone, then you walk away? Did you have a costume change? Wellyeah. It's the reception. Two different outfits. I also have a cashmere sweat suit for the casino and a silk robe for running to the ice machine. Wow, is there any part of the stereotype you don't fit? - So what happened? Start talking. - Nothing, nothing happened. It was a kiss. I just feel really guilty about it. 'Cause it was with guy? - What?! No. - Oh. Sorry, it's just-- It's Grace. You know, I had to ask. And now the bride and grown would like you to join them in a sacred expression of their undying love. The Chicken Dance. Rosie, you like chicken. Why don't you lead? Okay, everybody, just do what I do. Hit it. Will! Leo! How dare you sit out the Chicken Dance? There's nothing more insulting to a bride. Let's go. - So who is she? - She's no one. A volunteer with the Red Cross. Oh, my God, I saw that on "ER." Go on. We had this party on the last night and-- and we all got a little bit too drunk. We kissed. That's all. - That's all? Nothing else? - I swear, nothing. Oh, good. I was gonna wear something totally different for the Chicken Dance. Come on, get your arms up. It's the Chicken Dance. Not the Chicken McNugget Dance. - The damn maid of yours is going too fast. - Oh, Lyle, too bad our father isn't alive to see this. - He isn't? - Oh, damn, I knew there was something I was supposed to tell you. Okay, everybody, wasn't that fun? Go back to your seats. Got a special treat for everyone. Shrimp cocktail. - Oh, I love shrimp cocktail. - You get cantaloupe. Karen, did you talk to Lyle about the music? Did you tell him you were pissed? 'Cause I'd be pissed. Yes, I told him how I felt. He invalidated those feelings. And then I washed down my rage with several vodka martinis and a pill I found on the floor. I'm fine. Why are you trying to make something of it?! Oh, I didn't really care that much. I just wanted to have a dramatic moment with you. - Well, now you've had it, haven't you?! - I guess I have. Anyway, that's why I've been all weird about seeing Grace. You know? I miss her so much. I just got all of this guilt. Don't let the Southern accent throw ya. There's a lotta Jew under here. So you know what you have to do, don't you? You have to tell her. I do? I was kinda hoping telling you was kinda the same thing. Oh, it is, don't get me wrong. But you still have to do it. Yeah, I know, I just wish there was a way I could soften the blow a little bit. How do you think it would look on a cake? Ah, it wouldn't work. She eats faster than she can read. She eats faster than she can run. Look, she's gonna be mad at first, but then, she'll get past it. I mean, it was just a kiss, right? - Right. - Right. So don't worry about it. You'll make it through. You know, your relationship is strong. In fact, it's you two that give me hope that love can weather anything. Well, you and-- and Amy Brenneman. Yeah, you were kinda bawling through that whole TV Guide piece. The woman's a poet. I tell you, this is one gay man who will no longer be judging Amy. Now go call your wife. Thanks, man. I'm really happy I married you and Grace. Sorry, I'm late. Did I miss the Chicken Dance? Yeah, you did, honey. We just finished it. It was a good one too. Rosie led it. Damn it! You see, Ethan, if you wouldn't have made us wait 'til the end of Psychic Detectives. - You were watching it too. - That's 'cause you got me hooked on it. Oh, with that one that dy kept seeing the red shoe, that freaked me out for a week. Okay. Listen, why don't you stretch your queens, and I'll introduce you in a minute? Come on, guys, limber up. Which one of you guys is not wearing Glow? What do you think? I put that stuff in your Christmas stocking for nothing? Hi. Hi, there. I saw you here, and I totally wanna respect your privacy, but I am such a huge fan. - Oh, thank you. - I read everything about you. You know, People, Us, Star, The Enquirer. Sometimes I even go online. I'm sorry, are you saying that the details of my personal life-- the tragedy, the pain, the heartache-- that-- that's entertaining to you? Oh! God, yes! Are you wearing Glow? Mmm. Shrimp. You know what's the best thing about Vegas? You can just toss the tails right on the floor. Yeah. That's why they call it Sin City. - Do you remember our wedding, Jack? - Like it was yesterday. You were a beautiful bride, Rosie. - You too. - Oh, Rosie. Promise me, if in five years, we're still single, you'll be my maid. - Shrimp? - Queer! Hello, everyone. I'm Karen Finster. God, I hate that name. I've got a treat for you. Whoo! The hardest working lady in show business. That's right. She's an actress. She's a singer. She's a dancer. Oh, my God, she's talking about me. Oh, my God. I don't have anything prepared! Now I do. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Miss Jennifer Lopez. Or as she's known to millions of her fans, "Jen Pez!" Hey, everybody. I slipped on a shrimp tail. Ethan, please tell me you didn't rip my jeans. Everybody out of the way. Out of the way. Oh, my God, Jennifer Lopez. I'll worship you in a minute. I am an accredited nurse who recently gave it up to pursue acting. Tell me where it hurts. Oh, God, please tell me it's not the anterior cruxiate ligament. Okay, it's not. I can't do my show unless I have two backup dancers. - You can't just do it with one? - No. - Why? - Because I need two. - Can't do it with just one? - No. - Why not one? - 'Cause it's not two. Damn it! She's got an answer for everything. So unless somebody here knows every move of my intricately planned choreography, I'm gonna have to cancel and paid in full. Miss Lopez. Miss Lopez, I can do it. I know all the moves-- Miss Lopez, I can do it. I know all the steps by heart. Okay, well, can you do this? Let me check the butt. Girl, you're hired! Thank you. It is great to be here at the fabulous Caesars Ballroom. Oh, before we start, I wanna say hi to one of my old friends, Rosario. Rosie, are you here? Here I am! I must have been thinking of a different Rosie. It's the same one. WellI changed a lot too. You know, when Karen asked me to sing at her wedding, I said yes because I believe in love. I said yes because I believe in the magic that two people can create together. And I said yes because I get to keep one of the centerpieces. We love you, Jennifer! - So I'm gonna do a little number from my new CD. - No! Classic J.Lo! "Waiting for Tonight"! I can't stop myself. Okay, "Waiting for Tonight" it is. Like a movie scene In the sweetest dreams I pictured us together-- Now I feel your lips On my fingertips I have to say is even better-- Than I ever thought It could possibly be It's perfect, it's passion It's setting me free-- >From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried I have spent all of my life Waiting for tonight When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight Thank you. And congratulations, Karen and Lyle. And just remember, the secret to a happy marriage is Ah, who am I kidding? Thank you. Good night. Oh, my God. That was incrediblble. Thank you, Jenny from the block. And I'm not fooled by the rocks you've got. You wanna come up to my room and watch the Iron Chef? It's all about mushrooms tonight. - Okay. Can I keep the doo rag? - Oh, yeah, keep it. Ethan's dead to me. Jennifer, a lotta people say that we have similar skin tone. Okay, bye-bye, we'll talk later. Hey. Yeah, I don't know, Grace. I-I just wanted to hear the sound of your voice. Yeah, I wish we were together too. We should come here sometime. This place is amazing. Yeah, there's a La Salsa here. Yeah, baby, there's something I need to talk to you about. What are you smiling about, handsome? WellI did that. He was afraid to call her 'cause they're going through a thing. And I just said, hey, communicate. Communication is key. It's good, right? I'm Dr. Will. You get it? It's like a play on Dr. Phil. Not as interesting when it speaks. Hello, everyone. I just want to say how happy I am to be here at the wedding of my only brother, Lyle. Now, I don't think Karen knows this, but we Finsters have a longstanding family tradition of inviting the brother into the wedding bed. Now, now, I'm just joking, if you think that's weird. Show of hands, how many-- Thank you, Marion. Yes, it was a mistake having you here. And now I would like to propose a toast to my beautiful bride. You know, if you tell my wife, I'm gonna deny this, but for me, Karen Walker will always be the one that got away. >From what? I would do anything for her. She has already done so much for me. Well I love you, honey. She let me have light beer when she didn't want it. She's taking a course in salt water taffy pulling, although she didn't want to. She's well on the way to becoming a registered rugby referee. And she has agreed to fund my traveling puppet theater, even though she most certainly did not want to. She took my name when she didn't want to. She even got married in Vegas without her best friend. Even though she didn't want to. Come up here, my darling. How lucky I am to find a woman who's happy to mortgage her entire personal identity just for me. I love you, darling. Would you like to say something? I want a divorce. - Hey. So you talked to her? - Yeah. I was completely honest. Felt good, right? See, I knew. Grace responds to honesty. She doesn't often use it, but she responds to it. - So what'd she say? - She never wants to see me again. What? Over a kiss? Oh, God, let me talk to her. Okay, maybe you didn't say it right. I know how to handle Grace. I told her I was gay, and we're still friends. You know, and she was way more into me than she's into you. Yeah, I didn't really tell you the whole story, Will. It was--it was more than a kiss. How much more? We slept together. I-I didn't plan on it. I-I didn't mean to. You know, it just-- it just happened. One time. Y-You're still gonna talk to her for me, though, right? No. Now you're on your own. Hey, Leo, did you hear? I'm going on tour with J.Lo! I think I may have just lost the greatest thing that ever happened to me. Oh, Leo. But did you hear? I'm going on tour with J.Lo! Karen. Did you hear? I'm gonna tour with J.Lo. Jackie Finney and I are getting a divorce. Oh, Karen. But did you hear? I'm gonna tour with J.Lo! I mean, doesn't anybody care?! I'm gonna tour with Jennifer Lopez! - I care! Does she need another-- - No!

But but you know, Grace, stealing his stuff-- This is so handsome on me-- Is not going to make your anger go away I'm not angry I don't get angry Not since I found Kabbalah That's the string from a bakery box You didn't find Kabbalah You found ka-pound-cake Your words wash over me You see, Kabbalah has taught me there is no room for negativity in life And I believe him Kabbalah is not a person Then how did he write a book?

Something's different Will's eyepatch is gone and Grace's beak looks wierd Something's up in Pirate Cove And there's a chair here Yeah, Grace stole it to get back at Leo You know, if Vince ever cheats on me I got my eye on his vintage napkin set Fool doesn't even know what he's got He doesn't even have it on display! Didn't anyone ever tell you two that stealing is a sin? Yeah, a little something I learned in a town called Kabbalah It's not a town! Then how did it write a book? I can't imagine anyone having less understanding of this religion Shavat Shalom! I just got back from my world-wind tour You mean "whirl-wind." Did I travel around the "whirl"? Jack, I'm so glad you're back! I missed you so much! Wonder Twin powers --Activate! - So, how was Jennifer Lopez? - Oh, we're the bestest friends Yeah, we shop together we go to eat together And every night we unwind in the world-pool Did you tell her my Uncle Hesh was born in the Bronx? Yes, I did, it was all she could talk about we had to cancel a show You know, she and I had a moment at the wedding We were at the coat check and they brought her chinchilla wrap and I said "You know, I think that's mine." She burst out laughing Did she happen to mention that? Yeah, she laughed so hard she pulled her groin and had to cancel a movie So, uh, Grace I'm really sorry about Leo You know, Stuart and I broke up also because of infidelity But I understand why you cheated and I know why I did Cheating feels good Leo cheated on me, dumb ass Well, trust me He really enjoyed himself You know, the old Grace would have done this But now, I just have this new serenity thanks to Mr. Kabbalah He's not a person!

You always set me up! Uh, you might wanna slide an iceberg over the submarine Okay, look What Leo did was wrong No question And it was big No question But how do I know if it was big enough and wrong enough to throw away a marriage? I mean, what if I could find a way to forgive him? Shouldn't I at least try? I don't know, sweetie. I mean you've been so angry at him I know But I got it out Yeah, by vandalism theft, and yelling The three pillars of Kabbalah Well, now that I got all that anger out, I'm just really sad I miss him Sweetie, you know hatever you do, I'm gonna support you Thank you There's nothing I can't share with you - Do you mind if I - Your bathroom's down the hall! I can't believe Jennifer Lopez fired me Where did I go wrong? I replayed it in my mind a thousand times: She finds out her dog dies I present her with a mid-tempo ballad Here, honey, drink this It'll make you feel better Why does it hurt so bad? Probably because you swallowed the little plastic sword Why do we have to have this dinner with Grace and Leo anyway? Look, Grace decided to give him another chance So I put this dinner together so we can show our support But it's totally casual Six courses, some champagne moderate decorations Oh, and don't forget to sit in front of your place cards What am I talking about? That was all outlined in the invitation I don't even know how to act around him Do I like him? Do I hate him? Do I have an accent? Just act like a normal human being - Hey, guys - Hey Top o' the mornin' to ya, Leo! And look at you, Grace You're magically delicious! Manly, yes, but I like her, too Look, uh, thanks a lot for doing this I know it's awkward for the obvious reason I don't intend on paying tonight Oh, I thought you were gonna say the obvious reason is because you cheated on Grace Uh, guys, please No, it's okay I can handle it - I'm an adult - --erer (adult+erer °£ÅëÇÑ ³²ÀÚ) That's a good one.

Jack, Will's right We have to support Grace and Leo in their attempt to save their marriage That's it? What? You're serious? I have a question, though Are you endorsing this, Will? I mean, do you really think this is the right decision for Grace to make in her life? What, you're serious, too? What the hell's going on here?! A minute ago, you two were bears! Well Yeah Boy, this is weird, huh It's like we're on a first date Well, it is like a first date I mean, the last person you slept with wasn't me Sorry No, it's okay.

You honestly trust that something that, th-- That hurt you so bad once isn't gonna do it again? Peking duck looks good and it's not a metaphor for anything How am I supposed to know if it's gonna make me sick again unless I give the beef a second chance? Fine, fine, order the beef Don't expect me to pick up the pieces Can can the beef say something? You know, it can if you're on a Thorazine drip (½î óÁø : ÁøÁ¤¼º Ç×Á¤½Åº´¾à) I once spent a delightful evening with a London broil (·±´ø ºê·ÎÀÏ : º¸¸£µµ ¿ÍÀÎ ¼Ò½º¸¦ °çµéÀÎ ¼Ò°í±â ¾È½É ½ºÅ×ÀÌÅ©) - He was the darndest-- - Karen, please, please I think it's very clear who the beef is at the table And I think the beef deserves to be heard I was fired by Jennifer Lopez today And I recognize how devastating this is to all of us but I had no idea it would complicate your marriage or your relationship with Will was much as it obviously has I apologize And I wanna thank everyone for coming out to support me The beef has spoken Oh, honey. You're a complete moron Look, Will, If you have something to say, just say it All right I can't deal with this I thought I could, but I can't I trusted you to take care of her and you pissed all over that Now, I'm sorry if I can't just turn around and pretend like it never happened Everytime you go out, I'm gonna wonder where you've gone Everytime you look at another woman, I'm gonna think "Is it gonna happen again?" I can't trust you, bucko! That's right! I'm angry! - Will, I don't think that's fair - Actually, it is fair I mean, he has no reason to trust me, you know? I screwed up I let him down I let everyone down You like how he all of a sudden made this whole evening about him? Look, Will. I'm sorry You know, I wish there were a way I could make it up I'd give ya my Rolex that ya had your eye on But I see you're already wearing that Look, what I'm trying to say is that I didn't mean to hurt Grace Or you And I just hope one you'll believe that I hope one day I will too Okay, look I think there's one thing that everyone at this table can agree on You love me and you want me to be happy. Am I right? - Sure - yeah Can we order? Will, Leo makes me happy And I want this to work out So I'm gonna need my friends to be supportive Can you try to do that, please? For me I'll try Especially since you're gonna let me keep the watch You know, I had fun tonight Yeah, I did, too It was kind of a rocky start but I really like the way it ended up I really enjoyed Jack's stand-up, too You know, he's right White people really are uptight especially relative to other races Yeah, he's got a real gift for stealing observational humor I mean, why do we drive on the parkway and park in the driveway? - I'm glad we did this, Grace - Me too And I'm glad everybody's on board, you know? I mean, it really doesn't matter what other people think anyway, though What matters is what we think, right? Grace?

We're just gonna end up two old spinsters rotting away in this apartment, bickering over who peed on the sofa Look, first of all-- We both know who peed on the sofa Okay? And second, I have a boyfriend You and Vince are so lucky. You will never know the pain of divorce Well, that's 'cause we're legally barred from the joy of marriage It's 3:00 AM! What the ham samwich is going on? What are you-- What am I--?! What are you--?! Take that off! You take it off! I wore it to bed before you This is humiliating You coulda had the decency to at least call me I did! I left a message!

Tomorrow is my first rehearsal as backup dancer with one Miss Janet Jackson I need to be in control (Control; ÀÚ³Ý Àè½¼ÀÇ ¾Ù¹üÀÌ¸§ Áß ÇÏ³ª) You know how huge that is?

I'll introduce you to Janet Jackson Oh, that would be fantastic You know, Rosario wants to get her autograph She's a huge Janet Jackson fan Or was that Jesse Jackson? Which one ran for president?

You rent it Hello You must be the newbie If that means do I shave down there, yes - Hi, I'm Jack McFarland - Artemus Johnson Hi And if you don't mind my saying, uh you seem a little old for a dancer Miss Jackson doesn't like her dancers old - How old are you? - 22 - I'm 21 - I'm 20. I was born in 196-- 7-- 84 Okay, dancers. Janet's coming And please, don't make a big fuss It's not her style Hey, great entrance Thank you It costs a little extra but I make up for it by having all of you guys pay for your own costumes Hi, Miss Jackson I'm Jack McFarland I am dancer number 6 Oh, you're the newbie Oh, God, I gotta start closing the door in my dressing room Uh, can you start the music British guy? Okay, follow me! - And five, six, seven-- - W-w-wait. Can you say that again? - Five, six, seven, eight? - No, just the first part. - Five? - Five. That's it You know, I feel this connection between Jackson and five I don't know what it is But, it--it's powerful, you know It's--Five is a very mystical number Uh, this is true, Miss Jackson It is the number of fingers on one hand and the number of people in a monage a trois I think I want five dancers instead of six Which means one of you has to go Fire the new guy Who said that? Shut up, Kent Break it up, fellas Fire the guy who's been here the longest Shut up, Jack! You shut up, Jack! Come on, guys. Take it outside I think I know what we have to do We have to have a dance-off Dance-off? Dance-off! Between the new guy, and the guy who's been here the longest The guy who's been here the longest!

Yeah That's the-- What? The point is, you're upset and you've gotta get rid of that thing So wrap it in tissue and put it in my cedar chest I'll be right home I'm sorry, I gotta go I can't go to the movie - Grace is just having a really-- - It's okay. It's okay She's going through a rough time I like that you're a good friend - See you tomorrow at lunch - Yeah-- Wha-- Lunch? With my lieutenant I told you, like, 10 times Oh, can't we get out of that? You said the guy's a racist homophobe And an anti-Semite It just doesn't come up much 'cause there are no Jewish cops or perps This is my boss, Will It's important Well, if it's important to you it's important to me What, Grace? I am not wearing your sweatsuit Yours is lavender God, Karen, I'm so nervous I haven't hada dance-off since highschool Well, it wasn't so much a dance-off as I was beaten up by the football team But I still danced my heart out Honey It's memories like that those football player will treasure forever Oh, God. My knee I can hardly walk Luckily, I don't have to walk I just have to dance You're goin' down, newbie! Actually, I'm lettin' it grow out Why, Artemus Johnson Hello, Karen Well, well, well - It's been a long time - 12 years to be exact Seattle, 1992 We met at the Space Needle (½ºÆäÀÌ½º ´Ïµé; ½Ã¾ÖÆ²ÀÇ ¸í¹°, ³²»êÅ¸¿ö ºñ½Á) Unquestionably our country's greatest needle It started to rain And we started to make love The rest passed like a dream Taking the monorail to Seahawks and Sonics games watching them throw fish at Pike Place Market Sipping lattes at the original Starbucks Yes, it was quite a day, wasn't it? Wait. My dance-off opponent was your former lover? What a twist! I did not see that coming - This show is so sad - What are you watching? My wedding video Look, there's Leo and meholding hands Look how happy and beautiful I was Now all I have is my beauty My saaaad beauty - Why are you watching this? - Well, how could I not? It's on all the time! Come on, come on Watch with me Let's see if we can spot the moment where Leo checked out of the marriage Yeah, it sounds like fun I'm running late Got lunch with my gay cop boyfriend's homophobic lieutenant I know I've used that like, 100 times but this time I really mean it You know, this is really bad timing You getting involved with someone while I'm going through all this You're right This is worse than when I arranged to have my grandmother die the day you wanted to seethe Lizzie Maguire movie Can you at least stayfive more minutes? What do you need me for? You're just sitting around, picking at a scab I cut myself shaving three weeks ago and it still hasn't healed! Not that scab! The emotional sc-- Oh, never mind! I gotta go Fine, don't let me keep you - Wow, your hair looked good that day - You know the secret? I got it cut exactly two weeks before the wedding. And it-- No, n-n-no Nice try! You guys, did I leave my Lady Schick-- What the--! That's right, Jackie We're back together Like a Sicilian woman's eyebrows we cannot be kept apart How could you do this, Karen? How could you with Artemus my archnemesis? It's worse than that time you sleptwith Fievel My arch-rival Okay, calm downListen to me This is not going to affect you, or the dance-off Shh, okay? Now. I need you to let Artemus win the dance-off. Okay? What? Are you asking to throw the dance? That's like asking Einstein to throw the-- Wait, who's Einstein, again? I agree with Jack I prefer to let the best man win Let me win, please! Come on, let me win - I'm old - I'm old, too - I'm 33 - I'm 35 - I'm 40 - I'm 20 I'm 19 Game on! Now, if you'll excuse me I gotta go call my daughter who just graduated from law school today Jackie, please? Let him win Without this job, he's got nothing Besides, I love him! You don't love him! He's just a rebound guy I resent that! I am vulnerable And this is the first man that I have been with since my marriage failed who has allowed me to come back-- rebound, if you will-- from all that pain So how dare you imply some sort of "rebound guy." Fine! But I still won't throw the dance I wouldn't do it for 30 football players pushing my face into the gym floor and I won't do it for you! Yeah, they got me doin' this sensitivity training I wasn't sure about it at first but, uh, it's been eye-opening - Pay attention - I am Like, did you know you're not supposed to say the word "Oriental" anymore? It's considered disparaging Unless you're talking about a rug Made by an Oriental Ha ha ha ha! - Enough with the phone already - I'm sorry. Grace and I had a fi-- Never mind You know what else is not popular all of a sudden? "Wop" Yeah, it's a shame so many racial epithets have fallen out since the civil rights movement Excuse me Aw, me and my big mouth - Please tell me he's not a Guinea - No, sir. He's not But for what it's worth, I am - Hey - Hey - I'm sorry - Me too You know what?You may be right I think I'm making things worse Oh, sweetie I hear rustling Is-- Are you wearing your wedding dress? No, just the veil For God's sake, Grace! Take that off and put it back in my closet! Look, I gotta go Just, just-- Remember that jerk cheated on you and you are better off alone What are you doing? I'm stuck in there, listening to him talk about how he's learning to love his mulatto bastard grandchild I'm sorry I had to talk to Grace Right. 'Cause we're having lunch from 1:00 to 2:00 which only leaves you 23 hours to catch up on her problems What about me, Will? You know, this is a relation-ship When one of the crew goes overboard the ship sinks No, it doesn't That's a terrible metaphor You're a terrible metaphor - That's a comeback? - You're a comeback! Come on I won't call her anymore We talked, I told her she's better off alone "Better off alone"? See that in a lot of suicide notes Oh, my God! I'm sorry I just-- How can I put in words you'll understand There's a Hebe in trouble Welcome to Dance-Off 2004 Sponsored by Pennzoil (ÆæÁ ÀÏ: ¿£Á¨ ¿ÀÀÏ »ç) Now We're gonna do our standard routine I'll step out You two freestyle Now, during that time you're not allowed to do this Okay? Or this Or this But you can do this And you have to give meat least two of these Okay Places, people And Five, six, seven, eight All right, now everybody join in Please, Jackie do it for me! Karen, what are you doing here? Come on, Jackie! I love him - Ooh, here comes the change up! - Get off the dance floor! Freestyle Jack, you go first Oh, Jackie. Jackie, please. Please! I love my rebound guy All right, I throw the dance! Stop! If anybody finds a pin, I think it came out of my knee Jack, you're a very courageous man to stop a dance-off sponsored by Pennzoil Well, Janet, I love dancing high-quality motor oil, and you But A good friend asked me something and I-- I may not understand why and She's done a lot for me without asking questions So, I-I really wanna do this for her Well, it's nice that you'd throw the dance for her but you still wouldn't do it for me!? Karen! This is for you Oh, Jackie Thank you You're a good friend Artemus, yay! You can keep your job Let's go celebrate! No can do Sorry, we're through I was only using you to get what I wanted Now that I got that what do I need you for? Wait a minute. That--that gives me an idea Can you say that again? - What do I need you for? - No, just the last part For Four. That's a much more mystical number You're right, Miss Jackson It is It's the number of people in a monage a trois if one of them gets tired I only need four dancers Artemus, Jack, I'm sorry But you're both out Five! What was I thinking? Hey, Vince It's me again I-I just wanted to say I'm sorry about lunch. Again I-- I liked your Lieutenant It was-- It was nice of him to say that I-I wasn't as big a sissy as as he thought I'd be Anyway, call me You want a reminder of how good you have it?? Come look at pictures of my wedding to a future adulterer Why don't you just cut his head out of the pictures like everybody else does and move on? Ugh. Now there's a visitor? Vince, what's going on? I was chasing a suspect past your building so I thought I'd come up I got some anger I need to express I was afraid if I took it out on the suspect they'd suspend me again So, you're gonna beat me? I'm not mad at you, Will I'm mad at Grace Yeah, beat her! You're too needy And it's affecting my relationship with Will So stop being so selfish! Whoa! I have sat up with this guy listening to him complaining for years "No one loves me I can't get a date." And now I need him for a few weeks And you've got a problem? You're the one who's selfish! I'm mad at you. How 'bout that? - I reject your anger - I reject yours - Will, tell her she's nuts - Will, tell her she's bluh-uh Hey, that's really, really mature Stupid head Hey! Stop it, you two! - You know, just pick somebody, Will - Yeah, pick someone - Me or stupid head - Stupid head's mine, stupid head - Pick me - That's crazy! - Pick me - I am not picking sides here - Pick someone, Will! - Okay, okay! I-- I pick my boyfriend I really pick you It's like a stage whisper I can hear you Look, Vince, listen, I Grace and I have been together a long time So this tends to happen, you know When you date Will, you You kinda date Will and Grace It's true That's a bunch of crap I'm not dating Grace I'm dating you But I want all of you and I won't settle for less So when you know what you want you call me Wow. That's, like, the most romantic thing anyone has ever said to us I know. I don't want us to lose him Vince, wait! I know what I want I want you to stay I want to work on this I'll leave you guys alone It's time that I put this away, anyway - So, uh-- - Is that a wedding album? 'Cause I love those Mmmm. That's a nice dress Vera Wang Do I look like I became gay yesterday? Um, what-- What are you doing? I thought we were gonna figure this out Yeah, later, Rude We're looking at a wedding album Well, we haven't resolved anything I mean, what if I can never pick a side? Yeah, that's one of your hot-button issues You should work on that Yeah, work on that, Will This is Leo? Yeah He looks shifty Give me his license I'll have his car booted Thank you, Vince I'm sorry about your job, Jackie - That was your dream - Yeah. Well, you know At least I got to dance with two of the three greatest superstar dancers of our time Who's the third? Oh, Jackie Mmm Oh, to answer your question?

                    			You read funny, Will. Your lips don't move. Yeah, you'll notice I don't have to sound out the words, either. I don't think you're really reading. - Hey. - Hey, girl! Well, I just had to let my therapist go. Another one? You've fired, like, five this month. Surely they can't all look like Kevin James. Why is it so difficult to find a therapist who will listen to me, then fall in love with me, so I could reject him and get my self-confidence back? Just be grateful you have a divorce to talk about. Gays aren't even allowed that right. That's why I'm voting for Jim Carrey. Yeah, I'm sure, as leader of the free world, his pet detective skills will come in handy. Maybe I should start doing yoga. You know, so I can get rid of all these negative feelings and open up. Nah, maybe I'll just start getting high again. What's this? Oh, tomorrow I've been invited to attend a focus group for the new gay network, Out TV. They're looking to give feedback on some sample shows. Could be fun. I've always wondered how they pick people for those things. Or haven't I ever given it a lick of thought? I'm a prominent gay lawyer. I'm sure they think that my opinion will be valuable. Yeah, and they sent this to every guy who has a subscription to Jane magazine. Hey! I'll have you know that Jane magazine is the thinking man's Seventeen. Hey, why don't come with me? Oh, I don't know. I'm I'm not very bright. Jack, would I have invited you if I thought that mattered? - Really? - Yeah. They don't want to hear just from smart people. - They also want to hear from Joe Blow. - I haven't used that name in years! Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º ÀÚ¸·Á¦ÀÛ - ³×ÀÌÆ® µå ó¸  24 ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Will & Grace ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Á °ÇºÎ ¹èÆ÷ / ¼öÁ¤±ÝÁö ¹èÆ÷½Ã ÀÚ¸· ÃâÃ³¸¦ ²À ¹àÇôÁÖ¼¼¿ä So, I'm racing to get ready for work this morning. You know, brewing my coffee, fixing my makeup, making sure I got enough money for my lunch. And I ask Rosie to put my pumps in a grocery bag while I lace up my sneakers. And she says to me, "Miss Karen, I can't find them." And I say, "Well, find them, you big Aztech! I'm certainly not gonna spend all day in my Reeboks!" But Rosario doesn't seem to care. She says to me Guess what she says to me. Are you talking to me? Pay attention, Grace! I hate when you tune out. Thanks. Um, excuse me, why is this stuff free? It's paid for by our Alcoholics Anonymous donations. - Oh, this is AA. - Uh-huh. Well, they got bigger problems than me stealing a couple of donuts. If you don't put that donut down right now, I'm gonna blow a hole in the back of your head! Oh my God. Just kidding! Val, why the hell would you do that to someone? The same reason I pretend to push people in front of the subway because it's funny! So, Grace, long time, no. I didn't know you were a big ol' drunk. What? Oh, no. No, I'm not an alcoholic. Mmm, please. Those gin blossoms on your nose say different. Oh, my God, Grace, I can't even tell you how much this program has changed my life. And it can do the same for you, you know. Yeah, um, I really don't have a problem. Oh, sure you don't. When I "didn't have a problem," the thing that helped me the most were the program's mantras. Right here. Um, "Easy Does It," "Let Go and Let God," and my favorite, "One Day at a Time," 'cause it's also a TV show. You know my favorite mantra? "Cheers." Also a TV show. Okay, everybody, sit down. Let's begin. Ooh, Grace, Grace sit next to me. Come on, sit here, here, here. When I start shaking I need somebody I know to hold my legs together. Okay. I'll start. I'm Val, and I am an alcoholic. Hi, Val. Go. Um Hi. I'm Grace, and I'm actually not-- Sorry I'm late. I just had to finish making my hot cocoa with homemade marshmallows! I'm Grace, and I'm an alcoholic. Okay. Now that you've seen our lineup and some sample programs, I'd like to open the room up for discussion. I guess I'll go. Will Truman, gay lawyer. And, no, I' m not interested in starring in a reality show, but thank you. Um I think overall you got a lot of potential. Great shows. I love the idea for "Good Morning, Lesbian". The ones I know like to get an early start. Carla, am I right? All right, good, good. Thank you for your comments-- Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got your sugar. Now you gotta take your medicine. Excuse me? As a gay network, we have a responsibility to our community. Right now, our programs in general are kind of on the fluffy side. And I'm not talking about the show called "On the Fluffy Side." Where's the the historical perspective on gay life in this country? Where's the show about our continuing struggles? Where's the show that asks the hard questions? And I'm not just talking about the show called "The Hard Question." Okay. Thank you, Will. Now let's hear from somebody else. How about you. What are your thoughts? Me? Oh, no. My friend here is the smart one. I'm just the pretty sidekick. Oh, come on, I'm sure you must have some ideas. Oh, I don't know. I guess I thought You mentioned "Gay Jeopardy." It sounds a little kind of like a knockoff, doesn't it? How about something more fresh and new, like "Big Gay Brother?" Or "The Price is Rightand Gay." Well, you'll be happy to know both those shows are currently in development. Along with "Ashamed Family Feud." Okay, uh, any other comments? Yeah, I've been waiting to say something for a while-- Well, since nobody else has anything I was thinking-- Nudity. - I'm sorry, what? - Nudity. On "Gay Jeopardy!" Maybe when one of the contestants gets a question wrong, they have to remove an article of clothing. Or wait a minute. Shift it back. Eliminate the game altogether. Just have naked men holding buzzers. - Jack, that's ridiculous. - Yeah, he's right. They don't need to be holding buzzers. Oh, Rosie. What do you mean you forgot to TiVo "One Life to Live?" Damn it, woman! After my body accepts your liver, I am through with you! Don't get so worked up, Karen. Just take it one day at a time. What did you say? I said take it one day at a time. One hoo at a ha? You know, easy does it. Let go and let God. Where did you hear that? Who taught you that hate speech? I've been going to AA meetings. Grace, how could you? AA goes against everything that I believe to be good and pure in this world. It's just a really great place to vent, and I always feel better afterwards. It's like therapy, but instead of paying, they just ask that you give a donation, which I'm not gonna do, 'cause I'm not an alcoholic. Yeah. Well, it's a cult, I tell ya. Mm-hmm, just like the Moonies or the homosexuals or the elderly! Hey, Grace! You ready for our meeting? Ooh, I'm so excited, 'cause we're gonna have a special guest speaker today. I can't tell you who it is, but I'll give you a hint. He starred in the "Dick Van Dyke Show." You. I should have known. Only a nutcase like you could be behind this. Karen, I know that we've had some harsh words in the past, and I really do hope that you'll forgive me. It was the drink talking. Yeah. Well, now my drink's talkin' and it's sayin', "Drink me. I make life more fun. Everybody from a high school kid to a bum on the street knows that." You know what? I'm not even tempted by that. Hmm? / Come on, Grace. We gotta get out of here. Oh, come on, Grace. Please don't go. I can't afford to lose one more drinking buddy to this disease. I'm sorry, Karen. It's just such a sweet deal. Free therapy and free food? I mean, for Jews it's like hitting the lottery. And, obviously, it would be very different than the biathalons people are used to. Yeah, your unique take on the pole vault made that perfectly clear. I just feel we're losing sight of our mission statement. - We don't have a mission statement. - That's because I haven't read it yet. What about a tranny-athalon? We let drag queens loose in the Bronx, and see how many make it one block. Mitchell, please don't put your stink on my ideas. What about the idea I pitched earlier? I don't think that got a fair hearing. Ugh! Not "The Gay Ombudsman" again. People write letters, and he solves problems. I can't believe I even have to go beyond that description! I have the first letter for him. It says: "You're a dumbass." Let's see how he solves that. How dare you call my friend dumb! If you're looking to push a button call him "chunky." Okay, okay, okay. All right, all right. All right, all right. You know what? There are too many voices in the room. - Thank you. - Yeah, I'd to slim it down a little. - I think that's wise. - I'd like you to leave. What? Me? Why me? You don't seem to grasp what we're trying to do here. I think you should go. But everybody else was yelling. Why am I being singled out? - Okay, then you and that guy. - Why me? - So he doesn't feel bad. - I'm still gonna feel bad. Okay, then, he can stay! Do we have any beer? I'm dying for a beer. Yeah, I drank it all after I mowed the lawn. You don't drink beer. I know, I just have a craving. Maybe 'cause Michelle was talking about having a frosty one before the state took away her kids. Who? Oh Uh, an anonymous new friend I have. I'm really not supposed to say. Oh, actually, you know her! Michelle. Yeah. Our girl from the bagel place. Yeah. She used to be a professor, drank it all away. Oh, do we have any rum? Something's up. You're rambling, you're chirpy, you're looking for booze in the middle of the day. If you were picking me up from school naked under a mink, this would be my childhood. I'm just in a really good mood. I found a therapy group that I really like. - Oh, great. Where? - Alcoholics Anonymous. It's fantastic, and, you know, not just for alcoholics anymore. Uh, yes, it is. No. No, no, no. You don't know, Will. No, the program's for anyone with a problem. No, it's not. Okay, well, on paper it may be wrong, but it's really helping me. They're such good listeners, you know? And that's really hard to find. Speaking of which, can I run something by you? Ugh, what? Is it gonna take long? It's an angry e-mail. I'm correcting an injustice. Will, it's been over ten years. They are not going to give Patti LuPone a retroactive Tony for Anything Goes. This has nothing to do with that hideous scandal. The idiots at Out TV had the nerve to kick me out of their focus group. Well, at least you can use the same sign off as you did in your Tony letter: "I hate your guts, you stupid queens. Love, Will." I remember the day that I hit bottom. I was doing pirouettes on my father's dining room table. Now, keep in mind, that was about a month after I lost my hip gambling at a senior center. - And all of a sudden - Oh, I'm sorry, Val. Your time is up. It's Grace's turn. Oh, that's okay. Mine starts to get weird anyway. Hi, I'm Grace. I'm still an alcoholic. Hi, Grace. - Well, ever since Leo - Attention, weaklings! This woman is a fraud. She's not an alcoholic. Of course she is. If that's not a booze face, I don't know what is. Karen, get out of here. Grace, I am trying to help you. The first step is admitting that you don't have a problem. - Come on, Grace, let's go. - She's staying! She's a horrible, horrible drunk. The only thing that's horrible about Grace is her hair and her clothes. I know, it's like there no safe place to rest your eyes. She's staying! - She's going! - She is staying! - She is going! - She is staying! She is going! Accept the things you cannot change, bitch! - Time to pay the corkage fee, crazy. - Stop! I'm not an alcoholic! Okay? I'm just a woman going through a divorce who needed a place to talk where I wouldn't have to pay. Is that so wrong? Yes! It's awful, and that's coming from a woman who stripped for her father. Honey, you are a mess. And that's coming from a woman who stripped for your father. Okay, look, I What? Look, I am so sorry I lied. You all have so supportive and great. I mean, if you guys could drink, we would totally hang out. Welcome to Out TV. May I help you? Yes, you may. Will Truman. I have an appointment. I was part of a focus group here the other day. Didn't really work out, none of your business. But, uh after a strongly-worded e-mail, the network came to their senses, wrote me back, and said they'd love to hear some of my ideas. You wanna hear one? Yeah, it won't help you. I make, like, six bucks an hour, and all the executives make fun of me 'cause I'm straight. Hello? Hey, Will, I haven't seen you in a while. Take me to lunch! I'd love to. Can't right now. Listen to this. Out TV got my e-mail, reconsidered, and now they want to meet with me. Isn't that great? Great! That's really great! - Let me know how it goes. - I will. Thanks. Okay, bye. He's ready for you. Right through there. Thanks. - Hi. - Surprise! What the hell?! What are you doing here? I'm the Junior VP of New Programming. Can you believe?! Tim liked my ideas so much, the network hired me. Isn't that exciting? Why didn't you tell me this before, like, I don't know a second ago when we were on the phone?! Well, you seemed so excited about your meeting, - I didn't want to spoil it. - Ohh! I don't believe this. I mean, this channel could be a beacon of intelligence and insight for our community, and it's just a joke! Will, nobody wants to watch a beacon. Now, we are a new network. We have to do everything we can to appeal to the widest number of gay people, in Midtown, who watch TV in the middle of the night. What you're talking about has no substance at all. I mean, it's just gonna be shows like, what, "Queer Factor." Love it. - What? - I love that idea. I assume it consists of straight folks running from gay people? Well, I hadn't really given it much thought, but off the top of my head, it could be a bunch of gay guys competing by facing different phobias. Delicious. Keep going. Like having to get dressed for a date without a full-length mirror. Or or having to throw a ball in front of their fathers! I like it. I like it. Hey, straighty, get some coffee in here. We're making magic! Mmm. I love beer. - Ain't it the greatest? - Mm-hmm. Those people can drink this though, right? No, nothing. Ha! Crazy world. I know I shouldn't have been there, but there was something really nice about having all those people around who would listen. Yeah. I guess that would be nice. Huh? What do you mean? Well, honey I know you're having a rough time with your divorce and everything, but, you know, what about me and my divorce? Oh, well, Karen, your marriage didn't even last through the reception. You spent your wedding night at a casino, making out with Celine Dion's arm choreographer. I thought you were over all your divorce stuff. I know, honey, but it'd be nice just to check in every once in a while. I mean, we're kind of in the same boat. Maybe we could help each other through this. You know what? You're right. From now on, if you ever have the need to talk about what jerks men are, you can come to me. Deal. And if you ever feel like you want to talk to a room full of drunks, you can come to me. - Deal. - Ha ha. Wow. Alcoholics You know I think I recognized something in those people at that meeting. Something that I've never had the courage to face. Oh, Karen You can tell me. I'm really scared to say this, but. I think Rosario might have a drinking problem.

                    			Mmm. This envelope tastes kinda good. Taste the envelope. Stop eating the mail, Grace. I'll stop eatin' it when they stop makin' it so tasty. Hey! The new Advocate. The 25 Most Influential Gays Under 30. Why does gay culture worship youth so much? Ew, why is there a guy with gray hair in this ad? Hello. Hi. Mm-hm. New in the building? Yeah, uh, Ned Weathers. Just moved in to 10C. Wrap it up. Uh, anyway, I'm Will. And, uh, this is Grace. Hm. Welcome to the building. Thanks. Uh, you going up? Sure. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me?! You were the one who's being all nice to a stranger, fool. What's wrong with being nice to him? He's our neighbor. Follow the logic, Will. We're nice to him. Suddenly, we're picking up his newspaper. Then-- We're watering his plants. Before you know it, there's a fire in the building and we're the ones who have to make sure he "got out okay". I'd rather find out on the evening news, thank you. I'm not saying that I wouldn't trample over him on the way out. But while he's alive, would it kill us to be nice to him? All I'm saying is you just let him blow on by without any eye contact. Otherwise, you're gonna get stuck having to say hello. And nobody wants that. Hey, Jack. Hey, Karen. Just keep walking. Do you think they saw us? Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º ÀÚ¸·Á¦ÀÛ - ³×ÀÌÆ® µå ó¸  24 ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Will & Grace ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Á °ÇºÎ ¹èÆ÷ / ¼öÁ¤±ÝÁö ¹èÆ÷½Ã ÀÚ¸· ÃâÃ³¸¦ ²À ¹àÇôÁÖ¼¼¿ä Hi, this is Jack McFarland from Out TV, the new gay network. Uh-huh. We are thinking of doing a gay version of "The Swan", called "The Swan". And good news! After looking at your picture, we think you're the perfect candidate. Uh-huh. After we're through with you, all your horrible disfigurements will be corrected. All right, but promise me you'll think about it, Will, okay? Hey, boss. Hey, Jack. So did you get a chance to read the script of that new soap opera? I did. I love it. When Hubert says, "Let me be your eyes," I sobbed like a little boy who wished he was a little girl. Really? 'Cause I didn't care for it. When I was at Showtime, we developed something similar and it didn't work at all. Oh. Hey, hey, Jimmy, what'd you think of that new soap opera? -Oh, snooze. -Mmm. Now, this may be my marketing degree from Arizona State talking, but I think the last thing we need is another tired soap opera. Just making everybody gay does not make it interesting. Yeah, I agree, but Jack, here, liked it. You did? No, uh, that was a test. And you both passed. Check, check. How 'bout that cop show? Another tired cop show? Who needs another one of those? Really? Because in this case, I thought making everybody gay made it much more interesting. I agree. That handcuffing scene was a much-needed reminder that older men can still be hot. Oh, that cop show. Oh, I love that cop show. Yes, yes. What other one is there? Oh, well I heard someone talking about, like, a tranny and a crime-solving thing. Yeah, "Murder He/She Wrote." Okay, well, thanks for your input. Honey, is that tall guy your boss? He could pass for straight. I'm so jealous. I wish my boss could pass for straight. Karen! I'm in big trouble. Everyone here is so smart. They all have, like, degrees and work experience. And they all have that line you get from thinking. Honey, thinking is more damaging than the sun. Yeah, when I was young, I used to lay out and think all summer long. We just didn't know. What do I do? People keep asking my opinions, and I'm always wrong. Oh, honey, come on. It's always rough when you're starting out a new job. But I brought you something to cheer you up. Bring it in, Rosie. Come on. Giddyap! I'm not your mule. Yeah? Well, then why'd you eat that apple off my palm this morning? I knew that would come back to bite me on my ass. Can we still stop for licorice on the way home? You bet. Thank you, Mami. Cher! It's my Cher doll. Honey, I thought you might need a little friend at work. I know she's your favorite. Oh, thank you, Karen. I'm feeling better already. Cher is my fairy godmother. Well, godmother to all fairies. Oh! Could you hold that for me? Uh, sure. Oh, it won't-- I can't. I'm sorry. Oh, wow, that was really close. You weren't even hittin' the button. I believe I was. The button's there. You were hitting here. I'm sorry, have I done something to offend you? Well, that's good because I thought I offended you, but I guess you're just rude. "Rude"? Or Painfully almost abusively shy. Hi, my name is Will Truman. And, uh, I'm the owner -- proud owner I should add -- of one of your Zyliss rotary cheese graters. It-- Oh, it's a self-crank. With a, oh, 2-1/4 by 2-inch well for portion control. Um, I couldn't help but notice on the Internet that you now have a model with a wheel crank-- I'm gonna have to call you back. Well, I hope you're happy. Remember Ned? Your boyfriend from the lobby? Well, I just talked to him in the elevator. Now, was that so horrible? I'm proud of you. I invited him over for cocktails. What?! Why the hell would you do that? Don't yell at me. You're the one who was makin' love to him in the lobby. I was warm to him. Lobby warm. I was laying the groundwork for a lifetime of polite nods. Hey. You know? And then you extend an invitation? Why would you do a thing like that? I don't know. We were stuck in the elevator. He accused me of being rude. So to prove I wasn't, I invited him over. Faaantastic. Now that creep is gonna come walking in here on all fours, getting his filthy paws all over my stuff. Cancel! I can't. I already invited him. Well, this is the worst thing that's ever happened! Well, you got us into it. You made it worse. - What should we serve? - I don't know. I'm thinking something with grated cheese. Hey, Jack. You were hilarious at that meeting today when you said you liked that stupid show about the subway. Oh yeah. "Token Lesbians". Yeah. You guys thought I was serious when I was so obviously joking. Heh-heh. Had you going. For an uncomfortably long time. Yeah. Well, it's hard to keep a straight face at a gay network. Oh, my God! Is that Cher? Actually, it is a Cher doll. Did someone from advertising send that over? I mean, what do they think? Just because we're gay, we all love Cher? We don't? You're not actually gonna keep that thing, are ya? This magnificent representation of one of the greatest ladies in the history of entertainment? Absolutely not. Good. 'Cause if I were you, I would throw it out. Forgive me, Cher. For I know not what I do. And since I moved to New York, I sent two letters in to the Times. Bang! They put 'em both in. Both in? Wow. I think the secret is being passionate about what you write. And I don't think breeders should clip the ears of miniature Schnauzers. I don't think gay people should, either. That's funny. Can I use your bathroom? Go ahead. Just as long as we don't read about it on the op-ed page of the Times. You mean the op-Ned page. This is a nightmare! What a freak! Pecking at his wedge of brie like a diseased bird. It's time we send a message: Night over, loser. If I have to pretend to be interested in one more story, my face is gonna crack! "Oh, I wrote a letter to the Times. Oh, I'm a licensed pilot. Oh, I donated a kidney to a 14 year-old." Get the hell out! Why do we have to be so nice? You think anyone else in the building is inviting this letter-writing putz over for drinks? No way, missy. No way! Hey, um. I really should be going. - Oh, really? - Sad! Well Thanks for the cheese and stuff. - Oh, we'll walk you to the elevator. - sure "Let's do it again real soon, Ned?" What's a matter with you? I'm sorry! I panicked. There was a lull. I had to say something. So you pick "How 'bout Friday? We'll cook."?! Did I? I think I left my body by then. Dammit! Why are we so nice? It's a curse. God, I hate Ned! I'm going out for a coffee run. Do you want anything? Oh, okay. I'll have an iced cafemocha. Oh, you know what, actually, make that a hot chai latte. Wait, what is everybody else getting? I don't know. A bunch of different things. Um, you know what then, just a regular coffee. No, wait, make it a hot chocolate. No, wait, make it one of those weird fruit salad things from the refrigerated bin. Stop looking at me like that! I hate you! Get out! Honey, your assistant is so straight. I'm so jealous. I wish I were a straight assistant. Karen, um, what are you doing here? Honey, I just came by to, you know, check up on ya. See how you're doin'. Everything's fine. Everything's great. My eyes aren't puffy from crying. Okay. Well, great. Hey. Where's Cher? Uh, I believe she's on tour. And was her first show on the road playing to an empty can of tuna and an apple core in a dumpster? Rosie! Shame on you, Jackie. I had to yank her out of a raccoon's mouth. How did you find her? I threw her out yesterday. Luckily, this is the one day a month that I send Rosie out dumpster-diving in Midtown to look for scrap copper wire. It's always been my dream to amass the world's largest private collection of scrap copper wire. And make it into The Guinness Book of World Records. I guess World's Biggest Bitch was already taken. Jackie, why would you do that? You love Cher. I don't know. I thought I loved Cher. But Jimmy doesn't. And he went to a school in Arizona for a really long time. I don't know what I think anymore. I'm lost! I don't know my right from my left! I don't know my up from my down! Oh, my God! The floor's so dirty! Oh, come on, come on, come on. Breathe, honey, breathe. I can't believe we're having this guy over for dinner. We don't have people we like over for dinner. Rob and Ellen have never been here for dinner. And they never will. Mmm-hmm. Joe and Larry. Nice guys, good friends. I'd stab myself in the neck before I'd cook them a meal. Hello. Oh, hey, Ned. What's up? He's probably asking if he should bring something. Yeah, bring your other kidney. Oh, my God. I-I'm so sorry. No, of course. I understand completely. Sure, we'll-- We'll see ya. I'm sensing something good. Oh, it's good. How good? Really good. His brother was in a car accident. Ned's gonna be at the hospital all night. Will, what's the matter with you? That's not good news. That's great news. You like that cake? Here's the frosting: He didn't mention a rain check and neither did I! It's the best day of my life! Oh, I love this song. Ah, "Company." Maybe Sondheim's best. Isn't it warm? Isn't it rosy? Side by sideby side. Ports in a storm, Comfy and cozy-- Is the music coming from upstairs? Yeah. Ned's apartment. I thought he wasn't home. Maybe I should quit, Karen. I don't think I have what it takes to climb over all these bottoms to get to the top. Hey! These people hired you because they value your opinions. And they're good opinions. You know more about television than anyone I know. I don't know, Karen. All these people went to those high-fallutin' New England schools, like Arizona State. And while they were doin' that, what were you doin'? Watchin' TV. That's true. While they were wasting their time, taking a semester abroad, saving the environment, marching against Apartheid What were you doin'? Watching TV. Sometimes takin' a nap. Hm. How 'bout that? Your opinion means more than anyone else's here! As a matter of fact, I can't think of anyone more qualified to come up with mediocre programming that appeals to a tiny niche market than you. So be proud, honey. Speak up. Although-- Maybe not in that voice that you usually use. It's a little femmy. Okay. Thank you, Karen. Ha. Oh-- Thank you, Karen. Um, excuse me. Hi, guys. Could I talk to you in my office for a minute, please? Oh, well, can it wait 'til the staff meeting? We're enjoying our fancy coffee drinks. No, it can't. Ugh, that ridiculous plastic thing is back? Yes, she's back! And she brought my Cher doll with her. And she's helped me realize a couple things. You may not wanna hear this, but that gay soap opera? I loved it. Voice, Jackie, voice. Oh. I loved it. You're kidding. I'm not. We all know the only people who watch soap operas are women and gay men. And we both wanna see shirtless hunks. That's why it's perfect. The whole show takes place in a town where the women are missing. Well, maybe Jack's right. Maybe we should revisit "Mantown". And another thing. I love Cher. And I always will. There isn't a man in this room who doesn't owe his life to her. Who else was there to teach us to lip-synch, roll our tongue, and verbally abuse short people? Well, to be fair, poodle, Randy Newman did help. You know what? Jack's right. As a gay network, we can't afford to turn our backs to our icons. I'd like you to do a documentary on Cher. You think you can manage that? No problem. As it happens, I've already made a 40-minute film chronicling her years between her third and fourth farewell tours. That's fantastic! Does it matter if I'm Cher in it? Come on, Ned. We know you're in there! Oh, so now you turn off the music like it was never on? Too late. We already heard it, Nedly. Hey, there. "Hey there?" Are you getting this? Okay, don't "Hey, there" us. We go out of our way to make you feel welcome in this building-- Invite you into our home-- Oh, stop it! You don't want me to come over there again. You called me a diseased bird and a letter-writing putz. You heard that? It was a bathroom, not a bank vault! Well, we-- But you're taking that out of context. Yeah, it--it was a compliment. I mean, what is cuter than a diseased bird? And what--what's more appealing than a letter-writing putz? Put 'em together, you got a heart-warming Disney movie. Look. You really hurt my feelings. I'm new in town, don't know a lot of people. But hey. Let's just forget it. I guess what they say about New Yorkers is true. I feel awful. Me too. What's wrong with us? When did we become so cynical? I know. I-- I mean, what's the worst that could happen? We make a new friend? We can't leave it like this. What? You haven't abused me enough? You come back to kick me in the testicles? We're sorry, Ned. There's nothing wrong with you. We're awful. We don't give people a chance. Yeah, if anyone's a diseased bird, it's us. And if anyone's a putz, it's Will. So, if you're willing, we'd like to start over. - Come on. Dinner's still hot. - Yeah. That is so kind. But I can't. I'm having tea with friends. Unless you would like to join us? - Sure. - We'd love to. Come on. Will, Grace, This is Mitzi, Annie, Brian, Mr. Puffer, Cowboy Fred, Bluey, and Nick-Nick. Nice to meet you, Nick-Nick. Actually, that's Bluey. It's gonna take us a while to get all these names. Wow. I know. That was a weird evening. Really weird. Although you and Cowbow Fred hit it off. What were you and Nick-Nick? I was like, "Get a room!" Hey. Hi. Where are you guys going? Oh, we're just gonna get some ice cream. Oh, that sounds fun. We'll go with ya. Oh, I don't-- Uh, what the-- Oh, uh Hey!

Grace, he's a gay catholic He may never feel clean Whoo-Ha? Frosting for breakfast? Any chance of slathering this on some cold pizza? I'm just practicing my piping for my birthday cake And breaking in the new pastry bag-- Will, no! You've got to stop buying pastry bags No matter how many of these you buy you cannot frost the pain of your childhood away Grace, I'm not trying to frost the pain of my childhood away I'm trying to frost away the pain of every sad, crappy birthday I ever had I mean, What kind of monsters give a 10-year-old boy a baseball mitt when what he asked for was an autographed 8x10 of Chita Rivera? You have had some lousy birthdays Remember the year we went to James Taylor and that drunk roadie peed on you? Hmm, yeah. Ironically during "Shower the People." You know that I'm actually looking forward to my birthday this year? I mean look at me. I got a great job good friends, clean boyfriend I think if I ever had a shot at breaking this streak of bad birthdays, this is it Yeah, well, the bar's pretty low If you get a couple of decent presents and don't get peed on it's the best one ever I hope Vince gets me something good His taste is a little suspect Ya know, like when he got me those cufflinks off a suspect I'm not even allowed to wear them outside until the trial's over Look how nice my hair looks. And now I gotta put a hat on? I swear if this blue didn't make my eyes pop I'd be in sales Finally You're tellin' me!

Oh, Jackie. This Friday would have been Stan's birthday too Stan had the same birthday as Will? It's amazing how many fatties are Libras - So you gonna be okay? - Yeah, come on I barely paid attention to Stan's birthday while he was alive I'm certainly not gonna start worrying about it now So what are we gonna get for lady gay? Well, I am Will's best friend, and he is one of my closest casual acquaintances So I'm gonna go all out for him Okay, I'm gonna have you spend $40,000 on a gift and put my name on the card Okay - Hi-ya - Hey!

I happen to know that Will has really high expectations for this birthday So, whatever you're gonna get him it has to be really good Not some cheap key I'm gonna put it on a nice key chain Oh, that's great. Everyone loves a $1 thing hanging off of a $10 thing Look, I'm telling you do not give him that key It's a mistake How about that wallet you looked at sniffed, and put back? You been following me? Of course! You know, I remember thinking "That's weird. That mannequin's eating a french fry." Okay, look, this wallet is the perfect gift Ya know what, Grace? I'm sorry you wasted your afternoon stalking me but I'm going with the key And by the way, you might have made him gay but I made him good at it Oh, my God.

You up for some baby pictures? - I always am This is me at six months - You having fun? - Yes, so far so good Can't wait to see what Vince got me Yeah, but you know, that's just a thing I mean isn't the real gift the fact that you have a boyfriend? - What do you know? - Nothing Grace I can't tell you what the present is Then it would ruin it I'll just say that it's cheap and unimaginative - Well, then I don't wanna know - It's the key to his apartment - What?

It's a mature step in our relationship I can't wait to trace it in my journal tonight Hey, hey, keep it down in here!

Yes, Jack - Um, I've put a lot of thought behind this - Yes, I heard it And I've decided, in honor of your birthday, my gift to you is my eternal friendship Thank you Does anyone have anything for me that I can actually open?

I thought you said he was giving me a key What could have happened to change his mind? Will, I've gotta be totally honest with you - I think I know what happened - You do? Ralph talked him out of it Don't be sad. I mean, maybe he's gonna give you the key at Christmas Like in honor of Joseph and Mary who lost their room key and had to give birth in a barn Yes, that's my favorite Bible story, too When the blessed Virgin checked into the Bethlehem Ramad and left her purse at the pool Well, maybe this is a good thing Well, you said you're happy with the way things are Yeah, and the way things are is that I was supposed to get a key Another lousy birthday I don't know why I get my hopes up Who wants brie? Where did Vince say he was going? Well, he's Italian So my guess would be the Olive Garden I remember because I thought he said "Hamsterdam" which is a country I've always wanted to go to-- Oh Will, I can tell you're very upset So I got you this key This is the key to my apartment Whoa, slow down there, cowboy. Okay? You're not getting the one to my place Oh, hey, car 74 just got here Those guys are crazy I'm gonna go say hi - Hi-ya - Aah! Jeez, Grace, you freaked me out. I thought we had another haunted car. Um, look, Will really hated the wallet. You have to give him the key. Did he look inside the wallet? Oh, is the key inside the wallet? No, I put a coupon for a kiss inside the wallet That is so queer Okay, now, look, you've got to give him the key He's not gonna have a birthday until he gets it First admit that I know Will better Oh, this is ridiculous This isn't a competition Isn't it? Look, Will's happiness is the only thing that matters right now and that is dependent on him getting the key Right, which is dependent on me giving it to him Which is dependent on you admitting that I know Will better Your move I'm out You know him better - All right, I'll give him the key - Thanks Oh, one more thing Can you read this out loud please? - "Grace knows Will better." - That's very big of you to admit I'm a fool, Jack I never celebrated Stan's birthday while he was alive And now he's gone I guess I just always figured there'd be next year I guess you just don't expect to lose something that big I mean, how could a house boat just not be there anymore? Hey, guys, come on I had to light my own candles pour the champagne and start singing "Happy Birthday" to myself Could someone at least, cut the cake? Of course, Will Not like that! Give me Yes, enjoy your champagne God forbid anyone should make a toast You know, Will's angry muttering has given me an idea I'd like to make a toast Well, thank you On this day, a very, very great man was born Stanley Walker! Jackie, you don't have to do this It's too late. He's gone Karen, just because somebody's dead doesn't mean you can't celebrate their birthday It's never too late Look at George Washington I never paid attention to him when he was alive but now I get a day off of work Gosh, I guess that's true I mean nobody's ever really forgotten After all, I still roll into the ditch on Stan's side of the bed every night Karen, let's make a vow Every year on this day on we'll do something to celebrate Stanley Walker Okay, from now on this day is about Stanley Walker!

Will, happy birthday, friend And believe me when I say this from the bottom of my heart I'm gonna take this wallet. Heh heh Ooh, a free kiss Hey, what's your problem? - I know you want the key - I did want the key Until Grace told me that she had to talk you into giving it to me She only had to talk me into it because she first talked me out of it Grace talked you out of it? She told me that Ralph talked you out of it - Why would she do that? - I don't know Why the hell does she do anything? She's crazy - See ya tomorrow! - Wait, wait.

Ugh, it was so convenient The stupid State had to close it. just because a few people got held up in the steam room Couple of nude muggings, and the whole town is suddenly full of crybabies You know what? Forget it Instead of throwing myself into exercise, I'm going to throw myself into my work You do realize that when you're taking a spin class you don't pedal and you're really just listening to music I also was scratching my patch of eczema That had to have burn some calories I need an outlet for my frustration I just keep getting angry at everything Angry at Leo, angry at the gym - angry at you - Me? Turkey bacon is not bacon I could kill you, Will! You know it tastes more like bacon after you cook it, right? You know what? I just gotta focus on the good stuff Got my health.

Great to see you - Hey, Katherine.. - I was just telling my assistant-- - Hey, baby Oh, this is my husband, Dan Oh, my God. "Husband." It still sounds so funny to say Oh, I-I thought you were single Uh-oh No, we're newlyweds SingleHow depressing would that be at my age? Check, please We, uh, we just got back from our honeymoon - Didn't we, Mrs. Fallon? - Yes we did, Mr. Fallon Come on in Honey, honey. Here Take one of these I don't know what they are, but a licensed vet gave 'em to me Please, Karen Just because my marriage stunk like a bag of dead turtles doesn't mean that I can't handle a couple of happy newlyweds Are you sure? 'Cause they're making me a little queasy But, then again, I'm all hopped up on dog pills I'll be fine Anyway, you guys, what I was thinking was-- Stop the kissing! Yeah. Anyway, um, you know now that I know that you're a married couple, I might have to tweak the plans just a little bit Well, I don't know anything about design but I do know that we want this house to be about love Love..uh No problem I know all about love I love love Gimme one of the dog pills Better take two One just makes you stop biting yourself What do you mean you've never been in here? You're a gay man This is a gay landmark Excuse me. The hospital where Judy Garland spewed out Liza Minnelli is a gay landmark This is just a bookstore Wait a minute I think I have been here before Years ago Why yes, I have very fondle memories of this place - You mean fond - Both, actually William? I may buy a book If you're going to buy a book, you better do it soon Why? Are you gonna die? No. The bookstore is going out of business The rents are out of control We'll be closed by the end of the month That's terrible! I remember shopping here when I first came out Made me feel so proud to buy a gay book and have you slip it into one of your non-descript brown paper bags then put on my sunglasses and rush out of here praying to God no one would see me I know. I've been here so many decades, I've gone from calling Johnny here my roommate to my lover, to my partner, to my late husband Oh. That's so sweet The history of one relationship reflects the history of our struggle Will. I think that's the guy who fondled me I never thought I'd see the day when I'd be closing Well, if you'll excuse me, I must go in the back and watch my stories If I miss "The Bold and the Beautiful," I become a raging bitch Tsk. I hate that this place is closing You know what, Jack? We-- we gotta do something Oh, I don't know Do something? That sounds complicated Jack, this--this is our history It's like the, the cradle of gay civilization where where gay man crawled from the straight ooze and, and for the first time, walked erect Continue We owe it to our community to to pay tribute to the literary giants who paved the way for us to live our lives openly - People like Oscar Wilde, James Baldwin-- - Oh, I love James Baldwin! It makes me sick that none of the other Baldwin brothers talk to him - But what can we do? - What can't we do? A prominent gay lawyer and a junior executive at a real gay network that only comes on after midnight when the Korean soap operas are over Ooh, we have a new slogan: "Watch us please." And before midnight, it's: "Watch us, shipshiyo." You know what? Why not? I will save a bookstore today Ooh, but while we're here, can we check out lesbian erotica? I'm still trying to figure out exactly what it is they do Yeah. I imagine it's like bumper cars Honey, you sure you to do this job? You were a little weird yesterday That's because I was relating their happiness to my whole thing with Leo But you know what I realized? I'm happy they're happy If anything, it gives me hope that someday I'll be able to have exactly what they have Good news! The study's going to be a nursery - We're pregnant! - I'm outta here Um Is she coming back? We didn't even tell her what colors we wanted the nursery to be Well, honey, she's a professional I'm sure she's going to ask the baby before she does anything What colors do you see? Oh. Well uh right now, everything's sort of purple and you two have kind an acid green aura Oh, you mean for the baby's room! Oh. Are-- Are you asking me to--? Well, you do work for her, and she kind left us hanging Right. Well Um I'm just spit-ballin' here, but how 'bout some clouds drifting across a blue sky? Oh, I like that What kind of blue? Well, you know, a soft blue, like a 10 milligram Valium blue And then We'll do the mouldings in yellow Oh, that sounds wonderful A bright yellow? No, more of a-- Well, here, um Lemme show you my swatches Big crowd, Will A sea of gay and lesbian lovers of literature Also known as a Who's Who of Uglyville Hi. This is a great party Wait, are you one of the guys who organized this? Why, yes I am It's a cause very near and dear to my heart My lord, you're tall Would you mind coming into the back? I'd like to reach for something I can't believe it So many people talked about doing something, but you actually did it Whoa, Whoa, whoa I am not a hero, okay? "Hero" is reserved for firefighters and our men and women in uniform I didn't say you were a hero There's that word again You're welcome Yeah, this place means too much to too many people and there is no way we are gonna let it go without a fight Thank God. Because to see an upscale gym in this place would just break my heart Exactly. I mean the whole-- I'm sorry. What was that? A gymnasium They wanna take over the whole building One of those exercise chains that perpetuate the myth of the narcissistic gay man How awful All those floor-length mirrors and tanning beds just around the corner from my apartment I don't suppose those corporate devils-- Is it Crunch? Uh, m-mentioned when this would be open by? Probably in time for those filthy yuppies to work off their holiday feasts and tone up their bodies for their fancy vacations at Lake George I almost wish that they would take this place over and then I could join, and not wipe off the equipment - But then I'd lose my store - Calm down, I remember Hello, everyone, and welcome These reading glasses I've used as an affectation for years to appear smart have once again come to my rescue I never realized how important this bookstore was to the community until my.. very wise friend Will Truman said to me he said, "This bookstore is important to the community" So without further ado I give you Will Truman Thanks again for saving my bookshop from becoming an Equinox gym Yeah, I heard you old man So, we're, uh We're here tonight to save a landmark of the community Where else can you buy gay literature? Well, besides online It's certainly faster, easier, and the wave of the future. But For those who live in the past, we are here to preserve it This wonderful old bookstore Musty, pre-war Probably full of asbestos Gives you the lungs of a miner, makes you sterile, but hey, you got your book Heh-heh. Besides, it's not like you're-- like you're put on some government list every time you shop here You are And we'll be right back! Uh, Linus, go ahead and tell 'em about when Truman Capote bitch-slapped Tennessee Williams here and then later coined the phrase "bitch-slap" All right It was a hot August night - Will, what is going on? - They want to put a gym here - A beautiful new gym! - Britney Spears Federline, a gym! That is fantastic Wait a minute What about the bookstore? Oh, who cares? So--so they sell a few less copies of some crappy coming out story "I'm so confused. I don't understand my feelings." Do a one-man show like everybody else! Will Truman, I cannot be what I'm hearing You are the most shallow, self-serving hypocrite I've ever met Get out Oh, this is good for that, too Get out! I hate having to tell that I can't do a job It's so unprofessional I hope they don't ask for their deposit back 'cause that money's gone Honey, don't you fret about that deposit 'Cause I've got a surprise for you Oh, my God. Who did this? I did. You like? I love But You? I Wow I mean, for you to do all this, you must've missed some pretty important black-outs It's okay, honey. I'll make 'em up I'll pull an all-nighter This is amazing - Karen, you did a really great job - I did, didn't I? Honey, you were in a jam, so I-I worked hard put my nose to the mirror-- And finished something Wow! This is so beautiful It's exactly what we wanted Yeah, this is great. We were a little nervous after our first meeting You kept calling the loveseat the "you're-gonna-die-alone-seat," but.. Anyway, it's perfect How did you pull it all together? Oh, I am beyond thrilled that you're happy But, I have to be honest with you I wasn't sure I could do this job Uh, but then, something came to my rescue A friend of mine A little friend I call Inspiration Now, of course, of course, I'm only part of a team So none of this could've ever been done without one other crucial component Clients like you - You know, I can't wait to see the bedroom - Me either Let's go Come on, Karen Oh. Look One of my swatches - How did we do, Linus? - We didn't make it We fell $2,000 short Well 2,500 My check's gonna bounce - Sorry, I feel like I let ya down - Well, you kinda did All gone Just like that Well Look at the bright side You've been breathin' in asbestos for 50 years so I'm guessin' you won't be sad for too much longer You open? I'm looking for a book about a gay guy that feels really bad about himself That whole wall over there Well. Look who it is The worst thing to happen to gay culture since straight guys started dressing gay I know. I screwed up - We can't afford to lose this place - Well, I can't afford to keep it open Well, not that you care, but we're 2,500 short Maybe I can fix that Ugh. Will, that is so inappropriate I can't believe you're asking him to cash a check I'm writing a check to make up the rest, you dingus Oh, my gosh, Will This is the second time I've been touched in this bookstore I guess we've proved that a couple of guys can make a real difference in this city Thanks to us, people will still be able to see the spot where Gertrude Stein punched Alice B Toklas in the stomach and shouted, "Don't you come home 'til you've shaved!" - Well, at least for another month - What do you mean? This just covers November's rent I assume we'll be doing of these every month Next month, maybe we could put on festive holiday ball Oh. Every month So we get to do this again Wow. Well, that sounds like fun Yeah, sure. We'll start working on that, you know It's not like you can just adopt a cause and then abandon it We're abandoning it We won't let you down We'll letting him down You can count on us, Linus Can't wait for the gym to open! So close, sweetie. So close Where did you go? I turned around and you were gone I ended up having to take the subway Oh, did you invent that, too? What are you talking about? You took credit for my work, Grace! You were about to lose that job, and I covered for you, and you put your name on it That's how it works, Karen It's called Grace Adler Designs I'm the face of the company It's like--It's like with Colonel Sanders If you ran into him on the street, and you told him you liked his chicken he wouldn't say, "Oh, well, I didn't make it. Ramone did." He'd say, "Thanks. I'm Colonel Sanders. Do you know that we're doing salads now?" That analogy makes no sense at all Because in this story, it was my original recipe You're Ramone! - You're Ramone - You're Ramone Okay, look, this is ridiculous We're not gonna get anywhere calling each other names all day, Ramone I'm sorry you're upset But it's business I didn't do it for business I did it as a friend And you know what a friend does when another friend saves their ass? They acknowledge it Okay Thank you It's too late You know, for nine years, I have religiously shown up occasionally at this office and I have never once cashed a paycheck And you know why? Because you're my friend Or at least, I thought you were All right I'm sorry. Are we okay? No. We're not I quit - Are y-- Are you serious? - Yes.

It's been an hour and a half I just thought I'd give you that time to cool down Yeah, you also gave me just enough time to do all the cleaning up Oh, did it work out that way? What were you thinking? Why couldn't you leave well enough alone? Will, I am sorry, but trust me Everything's gonna be okay No, it's not. You know the old saying: If the hag hates you, the fag don't date you!

Oh, God How much butter did you eat? No, we just didn't click So, Gracie what happened last night? Did you call Leo back or did you let him dangle? Leo called? It was nothing He left a message How did you even know about that? How come I don't even know about it? Um, I know the code to your machine It's 52 Will's age Wait, what-- What did he say?

Let's hear it. Hey, Grace Sorry, uh, bad connection Ji--Holland Tunnel Just called--say hi Our anniversary's coming up Remember that plan we had? I w--thinking about you It's Leo, by the way So, you're not going out with Alan again because your ex-husband called you from a submarine? What is he even talking about? What plan? We'd always talked about how every year on our anniversary we would We would go back to the roof of the Peninsula Hotel And jump? And make love on the way down To commemorate where we shared our first moment together as a married couple We had our wedding pictures taken there I think, I think he wants us to meet Yeah, honey. Usually when couples agree to things like that it's because neither one of them has slept with an underage Cambodian girl It was another doctor and she wasn't underage Oh, Grace Like women can be doctors Hold on, you're not considering meeting him? I don't know Probably not Definitely not! It would be like the stupidest thing you could possibly do! You see, this is why I didn't tell you because I know you I knew that you would get all judgmental and finger pointing That's where you're wrong Bec-- Look I just-- I hate to see you all worked up over a few staticky words Yeah, G.G., I mean, how do you know he'd even be there? - Because he said he loved me - He didn't say he loved you Yes, he did at the end I didn't hear it and I listened to it like, 40 times today Here it comes --thinking about you - Here - It's Leo, by the way "I love you, by the way." "It's Leo, by the way." Okay, okay. All right all right. Grace I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything in there about love I think I might know what I may have heard And I am absolutely sure I may have heard "I love you". I think Why did he have to call? What does it matter? I mean, what if he did say "I love you"? What do you think's gonna happen?" You show up on the roof and you look him in the eyes and all of a sudden, he`s not the guy who always put work before his marriage - And, oh yeah, cheated on you! - Okay! Stop lecturing me, all right? This anniversary is kicking my ass already Just back off I need some space Space? You know what? That's a good idea I know exactly what to do Oh good, problem solved Will's gonna shoot her into space That's nice I've done that for friends Here's the plan I'm booking a hotel in the Berkshires for the weekend Great. Finally I can get some quiet around here No, you're coming with me I know you, Grace If you don't, you're gonna spend your whole anniversary sitting around here obsessing about Leo Will? Stop it Stop trying to fix everything, okay? I'm not going anywhere with you I just need to figure this out for myself Honey, I'm so excited about my date! Oh, good Lord They'll let anybody in here Honey, would you look at that? That's my gosh-darned gardener Good evening, Mrs. Walker or may I call you Karen? You may not! How the hell did you get out of the house? You haven't accrued enough points to go off-grounds! No, Karen, this is your date Apparently, his name is Cliff He is a widower a decorated war hero and a breast cancer survivor Stop humanizing him! I know it sounds crazy, Karen but think about it for a second You said you wanted somebody who knew you inside and out and who would bring you flowers For you But please, don't tell Rosario We have a casual thing going Great. Now I'm getting Rosario's sloppy seconds! Thanks for the crappy date! Hi, um, Karen Here! This is what a great fix-up looks like Hello, handsome Is there somewhere else we could go? My wife's mother comes here Your wife!? Honey, he's what they call on the down low Oprah did a whole show about it Married men who like to get a little man time on the side Yeah, but I'm not gay And I would never suggest you were Uh, would you excuse us for a moment? I don't mean to be rude, but I need to pull her over here and tell her how disgusted I am by you Listen When you come out give me a call That's the best you could come up with? I've never so insulted in my whole life! Yeah, well at least I tried! I wore my Doc Martin's to the nub trolling gay bars for you! I inhaled so much glitter my boogers look like disco balls! - I couldn't find anyone! - I couldn't find anyone for you either! And I wore my bone to the nub trolling all the gay bars in Manhattan The point is nobody's good enough for you Yeah, well nobody's good enough for you either And they never will be! It almost sounds like you don't want me to find anyone Yeah, well, maybe I don't Come on, let's face it, Jackie You're the only who's good enough for me Oh, Karen, I feel the same way about you, too Hey! Why don't we be each other's boyfriend? Oh, Jackie, I'd like that That sounds sweet Just one question How would I get my rocks off? Well, that's easy We just have sex on the side Like married people do This is it, Grace! I'm leaving! Weekend in the Berkshires Last chance! I'm serious, chances are-- are dwindling here All right, I'm gonna count to three One, two, three Who you talking to, crazy? What are-- You're coming? Why did you keep hanging like that?

Let's just say for you, all words are off limits You know, honey the same policy with my staff They are not allowed to say insurance, fair wage, can I have Christmas off to visit my children? Or ointment That one sticks in my craw too Ooh Ooh, I'm vibrating Which means I have a text message on my vibrator Let's see "All Out TV executives should come up with an idea for a network promo." "It needs to send a positive message to the gay community." So it's saying your promo needs to be pro 'mo Gay puns don't work on you, dear. No "No problem. My promo will be pro 'mo." Jack That was hilarious Driver, turn the heat up! There's a little nip in the air Oh, make that two of 'em Forget about the heat What about this traffic? It's so annoying! We haven't moved in a half hour Let's go! Hey, hey, hey, hey Come on Let's forget the traffic and the cold The important thing is, we're all here for Grace Screw this crap.

I thought you said you had to go to the bathroom I do Make sure the toilet has a park view Oh, my God, Karen, look Oh, my God. Look who it is It's that guy from that commercial years ago, remember? He used to dress in a devil outfit and sit on people's shoulders and offer them cocoa in a can He--he used to say "It's sinfully delicious." The Cocoa Devil! Honey, he's the one you should ask to be in your promo He's the perfect mid-level-celebrity-nobody for your mid-level-nothing cable network Gee, Karen, I don't know I mean, you just can't go up to somebody like that He's obviously very successful He's staying in a five star hotel Your suite's ready Oh, happy day, Margaret I see your bell's fixed Oh, my God. You're a bellboy? But you're a great actor You belong on Broadway I will be This weekend I'm picking up a brunch shift at the Times Square Howard Johnson's That's funny I once picked up something from a Howard Johnson I met in Times Square That's why I hate the word "ointment" Hey, look, this has a video of all the stuff we can do here. Ah Look at this one of the moon reflecting off the lake. It's gorgeous Wait, the moon's reflecting off the lake I can't see the TV God, it's so great to get out of the city and just appreciate nature Yeah, watching all this fresh air can really build up an appetite. Come on Let's order room service Oh, I think we can do a little bit better than room service Check that menu. I don't think you'll find an herb chevre and caramelized onion panini Oh, a new special from Chez Gay! Yeah, I put 'em in your bag just before we left I woulda put 'em in my bag, but your bag already smelled like cheese - I'll get it - No, no, no, I'll get-- Oh, that's curious This bread is as hard as our answering machine How did that get in there? Every time I reach for my keys, I always grab an appliance Grace Okay, I-- I just wanted to see if I could get clear on what Leo was saying What are you expecting to hear? That he's actually gonna be on that rooftop at 9:00 tomorrow night? Fine. Let's say that he is gonna be there - Then what? - What do you mean? Do you wanna go meet him? I mean, you could've gotten back with him any time in the last six months, but you didn't So what's changed? - Nothing - Nothing's changed - You're right - I am Because the romance and the moonlight and the anniversary don't make a bit of difference I know. It's just--you know, the sound of his voice just was really-- I don't know, it just instantly brought me back to No. No, no. I am not gonna get sucked back into this again You're right. You know what? I'm gonna get rid of this message right now Hey! You didn't have to throw it out! Yeah, well, you didn't have to throw out the blender just 'cause there was a spider in it It hissed and adopted an attack posture! You hissed and adopted an attack posture Don't worry We'll get a new machine It won't be the same I was saving a message from Vince Now all the swans in the lake are gonna know he calls me "fluffer-nutter" Wow, a gay network was "Cagney and Lacey" Well, let me tell you, we've come a long way Now there's an entire network devoted to reruns of "Cagney and Lacey" Hey, Jack Ah, Jimmy.

I need to call Ho-Jo's and get back on the sub list Actually, I already found someone It's the Sinfully Delicious Cocoa Devil Who could possibly be a better camp icon from the '70s? Let me just say again, Rip how trilled, honored and excited we all are to have you as the face of Out TV Oh, I'm excited myself! I can finally afford some new confetti Ah, excuse me, Jamie I don't mean to interrupt I believe I found the spokesperson for Out TV Here's my head shot I know the haircut's a bit outdated, but at the time, the Dorothy Hamill look was all the rage No, no, I remember you. You're the guy from the cocoa commercial I also did three years at Williamstown, two seasons at the Guthrie, and spent a winter at the Old Vic Uh, look, nobody's concerned about your prison time here We just look at talent Rip, sorry, but we have to let you go How dare you! And if you think you can get any more confetti, you're not Who am I kidding? Can you give me a lift to the bus stop, please? Good work, Jack But I feel bad about the way I treated Rip I'm gonna let him shake out the three-hole punch before he leaves I love the local news. It's so uplifting Those two old apple farmers lost everything in the fire and, yet, somehow managed to persevere Grace, you have to pay attention The crystal meth lab in their barn exploded Still, we should send money - I'm tired - Yeah, me too This is great It's so nice to be in a bed with sheets Thank you, Will For making me get rid of that message, being so rational You're welcome I wish I could turn off my feelings like you I'm just a big soppy romantic - Well, I have my romantic side too - Yeah What? I do I know, and I think it's great that you think you do Sweetie, I'm just say how grateful I am to have a best friend who makes decisions based on logic not emotion Well, it's not like I have no emotions I mean, just because my Grandma taught me that God hates boys who show emotion doesn't mean that I'm a robot It's good This whole Leo thing whether or not he wanted to meet me If so, do I go, do I want to? What does it all mean? I mean, I-- I woulda kept my foot in that door forever Mooning about what might be on the other side And you, you shut that door and locked it - I wouldn't say I shut-- - No, you did And thank you for making the decision for me I'm gonna sleep easy tonight Good night, Fluffer-nutter Honey, look at you in that headset You look like a high-powered TV exec Or someone who's about to hand me a shake Ooh, I'm getting something Yes, hello?

Yes, hello Yes, the talent is in make-up, and he'll be with you in five minutes He's a little behind I was in make-up before him Honey, do you think Winter White is a good color for Rosario's saddlebag? Feels so good to be wearing pancake again And not serving it at the International House Of Now may I see the script? Oh, no, no. Heh-heh There's no script It's just two lines. Yeah I need you to look the camera lens right there. I need you to say "Watch Out TV." Watch Out TV I like that, it's smart Yes, yes, yes "It's sinfully delicious." I won't say that It's demeaning No, it's not Now put on your horns and your Dorothy Hamill wig and dance for your 50 bucks I can't. I can never say those words again What are you talking about? Why do you think we hired ya? Because I'm a classically trained actor - I played Hamlet, Willy Loman, Iago - All in your cocoa devil outfit? Just Iago The world only knows me as a four-inch tall demon superimposed on Gabe Kaplan's shoulder Sure, I won a Clio and drove a brand new Mazda 626 But, like most actor in popular TV commercials, I became addicted to heroin But worst of all, I never got another job No one could ever see me as anything but that damn Cocoa Devil All right, come on, let's go, guys We're on a tight schedule We have to get that video camera back to PS 185 by 4:00 or my nephew gets suspended You're sinfully delicious! wait and see him with his pitchfork-- Listen you! I don't care about your sad life! You are gonna come up here You're gonna stand there And you're gonna look into the camera, and you're gonna do this commercial because there's 114 viewers who need to point at the screen and go, "Oh, look, it's that guy from that thing, I think"! I see Just give me a moment to prepare Honey, you were so manly The way you were hissing and spitting at him like that Karen, what you've just witnessed is the second definition of a tonguelashing at this network It's not pretty. But it's effective It sure was Look what it's done for Cocoa D He's running like a man half his age Oh, my God! Karen, what do I do? This is devastating I can't breathe Everything's spinning I'm hearing voices Oh, right--yes, hello. Yes, hello? Grace? Grace! - Bacon's ready - Is it burnt? I like it burnt Listen, last night when I made that big decision for you, I didn't, right? I mean, you-- You made it Not really. It was all you But I mean, Karen and Jack weighed in too, right? Oh, please. Karen and Jack? You think I'm gonna trust my love life to Vampira and the Adult Toddler? But you do listen to them Sweetie, half the time I don't listen to myself I don't have to. I have you You're always so certain - I'm not certain - What? I'm not certain What do you mean? If you weren't certain why did you sound so certain? I always sound certain I talk that way on purpose to seem smarter and hide my insecurities My real voice is more like this! Okay. No, no Will, what you said made sense Whether Leo's there or not, it doesn't matter Nothing's changed - Stop saying what I said! - Well, you were right - Well, I'm not certain! - About what? About anything A-a-a-about whether he'll be there, or if you should be there Or-Or if you two are destined to be together Or if chocolate is a mood enhancer 'cause it's never made me feel anything but regret Will, don't worry. You don't have to be certain, 'cause I am It's about time I grew up and started making some sane rational choices Listen to yourself. Sane? Rational?

I'm sorry I ran out like that, but I won't go back I've got a good thing going here A job at a nice hotel, a three-speed bicycle, and a room at the Y No doubt you're living the dream But let me tell ya a little story Between my first and second marriages, I did what many girls in my position do I backpacked through Japan, Vietnam, and Bhutan One day while was worshipping in silence at the Golden Temple in Kyoto, I was discovered by a commercial director Hmm. Long story short, I became the face of "Atooshi Kodki!" The energy drink of today's youth It was a health drink chock-full of vitamins, minerals, and 22 grams of nicotine Anyway, I became a sensation Everywhere I went, I was mobbed by Japanese people Fortunately, it was right around the time they invented pepper spray And you lost your entire sense of self Exactly However, years later when they discovered that nicotine was dangerous and replaced it with Ephedra and trace amounts baby laxative they offered me another commercial But I said no And that is a decision I have regretted ever since But why? You checked into a hotel just to pee - It seems like you have everything - Not everything! I would trade it all for the chance to be famous again It is the greatest thing any human can achieve You are never closer to God than when you are on television Now you say it - I don't think I can - Say it - No - Say it, bitch It's sinfully delicious I knew you'd be here Hi You know you went out for maple syrup What are you doing? I needed to know if he was gonna show up Why? Did you guys have plans for a romantic rendezvous, too? I'm here so that if any time in the future you start wondering if he came or not, I'll have the answer Oh Now I can't get mad at you for ditching me I didn't ditch you. I took that awful bus so you could have the car You left me the car? Oops Look I like that you pay all my bills, and you do all my laundry, and make all my meals for me, but you really don't have to ake care of me anymore I feel like I do Well, you don't Although on our way out, I do need $675 for the taxi What about you? What are you doing here? - I came to take you home - Really? Not 'cause you wanted to see if he'd show? Nope Just for you Let's go So what are you gonna make me for dinner? Dinner? I thought I didn't have to take care of you anymore Baby steps, Will Hmm, guess it's not too late to glaze a ham Karen, thank you so much The spot went great I owe you a big favor Anything you ever need, just ask - Well, honey, in that case-- - No! Will you get off my back, woman? Atooshi Kodki! Atooshi Kodki! Come on! Karen, I don't understand. Why are Japanese people always so into you?

The guy hasn't even taken my order yet Ugh, unbelievable I don't know what's happened to the work ethic in this country Don't you have a job to be at? I promised myself I wouldn't repeat outfits So, uh, until I go shopping again I'm not going back Oh, I'm so hungry I am this close to actually getting up and pouring myself a glass of juice Hey, hey, hey! don't talk crazy I'm starving too but we're not gonna feed ourselves like a fat family on a camping trip And, when you pour your own glass of juice you are taking a job away from someone who came to this country in a crate or an innertube This is torture Can we talk about something besides food? Okay This is a little embarrassing but I had the weirdest dream last night Oh, honey is it the one where you're wearing sweats that make you look like a large formless piece of clay? 'Cause that ain't no dream Sorry, I don't look my best I guess unlike you I didn't take my head out of a hat box and staple it to my neck Anyway, no it's a recurring dream I keep having it over and over and over and over I see Is this the first time you've had it? That's a good question, Jack Okay, anyway. In my dream I'm on the subway completely naked And then, all of a sudden that hot gardener from "Desperate Housewives" gets on and he puts his hand on my breast Then that hot smart guy from "Jeopardy!" gets on and puts his hand on my other breast Then that hot Korean guy from "Lost" gets on and puts his hand on my other breast Oh, yeah, in this dream I have three breasts I see Well, I would say that dream represents your fear of dentists Perhaps I'm just saying that because my dentist is hot, smart, and Korean And, for all I know tri-breasted I think I just need to have sex Honey, you know, you and I are going through the same exact thing I haven't had sex in a while either We just need to get back on the horse Or, better yet get back on the man I can't take it anymore I'm so hungry I'm gonna have one of these pumpkin candies Now I'll have to call Dr. Hung Okay, you know what? This is just rude And if there is one thing I cannot abide, it is rudeness! Hey, homo we're hungry out here! Here's an idea. How about three big bowls of "Get-out-io's"? There's sugar on one side and I'm not your damn cook on the other! I'd like mine with bananas, please I don't have time to make breakfast today I'm meeting Vince's mom But we're all going over there for Thanksgiving in two days Why don't you just meet her then? I need a head start Vince says she's a tough cookie Oh, that doesn't sound so bad Yeah, what he actually said was that she's already decided to hate me and good luck Well, that doesn't sound so bad Apparently she's never liked any of his boyfriends So I'm gonna take her for a day of shopping You know, give her a whole pretty woman makeover Without spending more than $100 Where're you taking her shopping? Flint, Michigan? Well, I just--I want to get to know her, ya know So I can tell her how honored I am to meet her and how much it means to me to become part of her family You know, just generally blow a bunch of smoke up her fat ass Honey, you know what else is fun?

I'm so hungry I knew I shouldn't have given my Powerbar to that homeless woman I tried to get it back, but her kid was just grippin' it too tightly Service here always stinks How come this place got such a good write-up in the Fagot's Guide? (fogot È£¸ðº¸´Ù ÇÑÂü ´õ ºñÇÏÀûÀÎ ¸») Honey, it's pronounced "fa-GATZ." Actually, fools it's Zagat's Uh, not this one It rates restaurants based on cuteness of the wait staff You see here This one got five smiley butts Speakin' of butts had another sex dream last night This time I was in the shower with Barack Obama Oh-bama he was ba-rocking my world Well, you better do it soon You know what they say If you don't use it it'll fall off What exactly will fall off? I don't know. I don't know what you guys have down there Oh, honey let me explain Imagine the most beautiful flower you've ever seen Its petals opening as it's gently touched by the sun Now imagine a vagina next to it See, even that made me horny Where is that stupid waiter? You just know that idiot got all our orders mixed up Well, here comes the swarthy immigrant now Don't think you're gettin' a tip Oh, that's okay Just the privilege of ordering it paying for it, and hauling it over here is reward enough Ooh, sassy waiters just like the guide promised Well, it's official My mother's toe's broken -Oh, no -What happened? Didn`t he tell you? Uh, I thought I did. Ya know we went shopping. And she-- she fell. It was nothing It was no big deal, you know Certainly no one's fault "No one's fault"? He pressured her into trying on these four-inch hooker heels And then he told her to "work it, girl." Okay, in hindsight maybe it wasn't a good idea to make her climb up on the display case and shake her "groove thang," but you know She was having fun up until the time that she fell, and her skirt hiked up and she showed her groove thang to the whole store Well, she sounds like a ball of fun I can't wait to meet her tomorrow She's a hooker, you say? Well, you can all forget about it You can forget it because Thanksgiving's cancelled Why, does she cook with her feet? This is gonna be the first Thanksgiving we're not together as a family since we came over on the Mayflower Mayflower Movers Before Queens, we lived in Bayonne.' Great.

We can do the whole thing at your mother's house She wouldn't have to lift a finger Of course she won't she cooks with her feet I don't know. My mom likes Thanksgiving to be just so She's not too thrilled with you right now, you know You could be setting yourself up for a disaster Or am I setting myself up to be a hero? Pa, who's that handsome stranger who saved Thanksgiving? Well, Ma, I reckon it's our son's boyfriend Yeah, I live in Flushing not the oddly tolerant Ozarks Trust me, by the end of the evening she'll not only have forgiven me she'll be thankin' me All right let's give it a shot Hey, don't worry Will is known for his perfect Thanksgivings Except the one where he proposed to me told me he was gay, and then snuck out in the middle of the night while I was sobbing in bed But I hardly ever think about that one What a cute neighborhood I always thought Queens was just a place to bury bodies or buy discount meat Queens gets a bad rap It doesn't help that we got a town called Flushing (ÇÃ·¯½Ì: ¼ö¼¼½Ä) - Makes you think of poop - Yeah, I got it Well, so this is it, huh? Family kitchen I bet there's a lot of history here Yeah, sure is Right there That's the spot my uncle got shot And, uhThat's where I was standing when I accidentally shot my uncle Whereas I was thinking less along the lines of bloodshed and more along the lines of pasta dinners Yeah, don't say "whereas" in front of my mom She already thinks you're a preening sadistic boob I'm paraphrasing Don't you worry Whatever she dishes out I can take Today I have the patience of a saint And, from looking around the room I have plenty to choose from - Vinnie. - Hey, Ro.

Ro - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Wanna hold my hand? I'm not a therapist though I do own a monocle, but it seems to me perhaps you should not marry him But I have to My parents have been dreaming about my wedding forever It'll kill them to know that their only girl loves only girls Whoa, what are you talking about? Your parents have done everything right They raised all their kids gay Why would they not accept you? It's different with Vince He's a guy, and we're Italian All Italian guys are gay That's because the country's shaped like a thigh-high boot Look, you're the only person who knows so please don't tell anyone Well, I won't but you have to, Ro And this is the perfect opportunity. Thanksgiving celebrates the day the girl Indians first introduced the girl pilgrims to sex Yeah, they called it "maize".

At dinner You can wave a turkey leg for emphasis - Hey - Hey - I'm Sal - Grace. - So you wanna see the garage? - Yeah Don't do that! That's Kinda how I shot my uncle Oh. I'm gonna throw 'em out and start again Don't worry about it This is Queens Three second rule's like a three day rule (¹¹µç 3ÃÊ ³»¿¡ ÇÏ¸é ¿ë¼­ µÈ´Ù´Â ¹ýÄ¢) No, no, no I'm gonna throw them out Your mom will know She's a witch I mean, she's darling Why are you doing this to yourself?

We can't do it together? Would it kill you to spend some time with me?! You shouldn't do that That's kinda how Vince shot his uncle Annette I had the feeling our paths would cross again Why are you talking like that? I don't know it just seemed appropriate the way you appeared out of the mist like a Nazi soldier You seem nervous, Will Like maybe you think you gotta impress me or something - I don't? - No, you do You know, this family's got a lot of happy occasions coming up Christmas, New Year's Ro's wedding You think you're gonna be here for all of 'em? I'd like to think I am And I'd like to think I'm gonna dance again I know one thing for sure By the end of the night you're gonna love me I doubt it I've yet to meet a man who's good enough for my son Believe me, it would have to be one hell of a perfect evening for me to feel that way about you -Is that a challenge, Annette? -It might be Then meet me on the airfield with the letters of transit. Come alone I don't know what the hell that was but I don't like it! I thought we were doing a thing! Oh, damn it! Oh, God There you are I've been looking all over for you This two-bedroom attached house is like a Rubik's Cube (·çºò½º Å¥ºê: Á¤À°¸éÃ¼ »öÀ» ¸ÂÃß´Â ÆÛÁñ) How's it going out there? Great! Big news The wedding's off Ro is a lesbian and she's gonna tell everybody at dinnertonight If you never told me to talk to her I woulda never convinced her to come out today But don't worry, buddy I'll give you all the credit Jack, she cannot come out tonight! Because if she does, her mother is somehow gonna blame it on me This has to be the perfect dinner and I'm not gonna let you or any other lesbian ruin it Will, don't be so insensitive Put yourself in her Birkenstocks Look, I think it's great that she wants to come out I'm sure she has all the makings of a wonderful lesbian and she's going to make a bunch of cats a fine mother someday But not today Today is my day! Wildred Pierce! (¹Ðµå·¹µå ÇÇ¾î½º: ¸Í¸ñÀûÀÌ°í ¼º°øÁöÇâÀûÀÌ¾ú´ø ¿µÈ­¿Í ¼Ò¼³ÀÇ Ä³¸¯ÅÍ) I am ashamed of you! And not just because your hands are out of proportion to the rest of your body This is one of the hardest things for a gay person to do and being a lesbian is very close to being a gay person You made me come out to my mother on Thanksgiving It was the best decision of my life Why would you wanna deny her that? You're right She should come out whenever she's ready I'm being selfish - Where is she? - Watching football Of course she is Karen. I did it You put lipstick on all the Virgin Marys around the house? No, no, not yet -Hey -Hey I made out with him It was so hot! And his tongue was everywhere I swear he tried to unhook my bra with it Honey, I can roll dice with my tongue Karen, you were so right It was just what I needed You should really take your own advice one of these days and get back in there No, honey that's not for me I mean, I know I talk a good game, but well I guess I can tell ya Grace, I'm a virgin I've never even seen a man's tenders Actually, I'm up to 1,400 Hey, Ro. Listen, Jack told me all about what you told him and I just want you to know I couldn't be happier What? He told you? Oh no no! Only because he knows how supportive and sensitive I am Oh, thank you Keeping it in has been such a struggle.. Yeah. I'm talking Look-- I just want you to be absolutely sure You may not be a lesbian I mean, everybody fantasizes about Angelina Jolie Yeah, I told my trainer I want her stomach - Hello? - I'm sorry I got distracted when you mentioned Angelina Jolie I kept picturing her with Renee Could you imagine if they went to the same camp? Okay, you are a lesbian Congratulations and--and welcome But, um-- Do you. do you need to come out today? Well, Jack told me that's what Thanksgiving is for Oh, Jack No, dear. No Thanksgiving is traditionally when gay men come out Lesbians come out at Christmas I think it has something to do with all the bulky sweaters (¹Ì±¹¿¡´Â ÀüÅëÀûÀ¸·Î Å©¸®½º¸ ½º¿¡ ÀÔ´Â ÃÌ½º·¯¿î ÅÐ ½º¿þÅÍ°¡ ÀÖ´Ù°í ÇÔ) Well, that does make sense Plus, I like the whole message of Christmas You know, that a woman can have a baby without a man So. Ro and Matt they're getting married at Saint Mel's Oh, Saint Mel's My favorite saint I love the way he used to boss around Alice (ÀèÀº "¾Ù¸®½º" ó´Â 7-80³â´ë ½ÃÆ®ÄÞ¿¡ ³ª¿À´Â '¸á' ¾ê±â¸¦ ÇÏ°í ÀÖÀ½) Hey, Dad Dallas score yet?

Oh, my God he's a monster! Thank you Thank you I thought it was. I thought it was all in my mind. Yeah, which one is he again? Hi, honey Karen, why are you all - Hey - Hey - Here's your dice back - Hey! Oh, yeah What did you do? Oh, honey you were right That was just what I needed Oh, that hunky spaghetti jockey chewed my ear like he was at an all you-can-eat calamari bar How could you? What? You told me to Not with my guy!! Well, honey I didn't plan it After I pulled his shirt off we had nothing left to talk about - Hey, Vince - What are you smiling about? Nothing -Hey -Hey Hey!! Just got his learner's permit Thinks he's the coolest - I'm so into him - Yeah? Well, I'm double into him - Well, I'm gonna ask him out - I'm gonna ask him to move in He gave me a hickey He gave me a child I am pregnant, Grace! No, you're not You can't get pregnant from kissing Oh, thank God! Look, I am not sharing him with you I think that Sal is serious relationship material Dude, I just macked on two old ladies I might need to borrow your dad's shed later Baby cousin Sal is such a good little host He gave Grace a tour of my bedroom Now he's giving it to Karen Yeah. I had a peek at it before When did your mom turn it into a sewing room? She didn't It's exactly how I left it That's my old Singer and my old sewing trophies How's everything going in here? Don't mind me I'm just getting some ice for my injury You know we usually eat at 4:00. It's ten 'til Don't you worry everything's gonna be perfect Who you trying to convince? Me or you?

He got to you with his devilish charm and those piercing eyes and occasional touch you never know what it means Ah, Will. It just seemed to make sense to wait Plus Matt has his camp reunion the first week in December and there's a rumor Renee Zellweger may show up Have you seen her as a brunette? But if you do it now, you'll get Christmas presents that you can actually use Like a chunky diving watch Or a little camera you can make documentaries with I do have an idea for a short on female iron workers I have just the Ani DiFranco song to play over the credits (Æä¹Ì´ÏÁòÀû ¼ºÇâÀÌ °­ÇÑ ¿©°¡¼ö) There you go See, it's not healthy to keep something like that bottled up It's not fair to you or Matt You're right.I have to tell them Thank you Has anyone ever told you you're a very wise man? No, they have not Gin We've been playing poker Then poker Look at him Just sitting there eating his peanuts like he wishes I was never even born Funny, he just looks like a man eating peanuts to me Hey, Vince Does this color look okay to you?

All right, all right, everybody Now listen Usually, every year, it's traditional I give the toast on Thanksgiving, but being that Will did such a wonderful job preparing the meal I think it's only right that he should do it Oh, thank you, Paul Look all All Vincent and I wanted was for this warm wonderful family toto be together -Turkey's a little dry. -No, it isn't Because, when you get right down to it what is a perfect Thanksgiving? -Instant potatoes? -No, they're fresh It's not about Pilgrims or food, or football Or salad forks 'cause I don't got one It's about family and friends What are we supposed to do? Eat this with our hands? What is wrong with you, lady?! It's like the only nice bone in your body was in your toe! And that got crushed when you forgot how to walk with shoes on! All I wanted was for you to like me Because I love Vince and Vince loves you Do you have any idea how much trouble I've gone through today to try to make it perfect for you? Your 16-year-old nephew made out with a woman twice his age And then another woman ten times his age! Your soon to be married daughter is a lesbian! But did you hear about any of that? No! Not until just now when I accidentally blurted it out! And now, because I'm guessing the rest of the family hates me I'm gonna go Grace, Jack, Karen, your coats please! Let's go! Quickly! Wait, wait wait a minute! You love my son? I do And you love him? I do, Mommy And you you love women? Well, just once with, uh Matt's secretary.

I had to pull you off! Yeah, well, we're guests I didn't want to be rude! The old whore is back! Oh, speaking of old whores wasn't it great when Nana woke up and played jazz piano for two hours?

I do not get it Umhey I just got back from tea at your mother's, and something terrible happened Oh no, did another one of her friends admit to sleeping with my father? Um, this happened when I went to set my drink on the mantel Mantel? Not the mantel where my mother keeps her Lladro collection Maybe Grace Look me in the eye and tell me that nothing happened to any one of those figurines Okay. Particularly not the Bashful Geisha - Why, was she special? - "Was"?! Was! Oh, you animal! You clumsy animal! Do you have any idea how important Wi-San was to my mother?! Well, if she was so important, why was she in front of the cashews! She loved that figurine When my brother Sam started a fire making french fries, Wi-San was the only thing my mother ran back in the house to save The rest of us had to be alerted by a neighbor! Hey, Will. Do you have time to go over the Morris case? Marc, you went to Harvard. Do I have to remind you it's potluck week? Now, please, go make a 195 miniature flans Okay, that's why I'm the second gayest lawyer here Okay, all right. I-I need to think here. Think, Grace, think Interesting that you have to remind yourself to do that Okay, I got it! I'm gonna get her a new one. Good thinking, Grace! You can't get her a new one. They-- they stopped making them when Japanese- Americans began picketing the factory Oh, my God I have to tell her Wait, w-w-w-wait, whoa She doesn't know? No, I was alone in the living room pouring cashews into my purse After it broke, I kicked it under the sofa This is good. If she doesn't know, we don't tell her. That would be the worst thing in the world. Listen to me Don't say a word. Pretend it never happened I can't do that. I feel terrible You know what your problem is? Jewish guilt It gets you every time You know how many Jewish serial killers there are? Not many because they kill once, then they feel too guilty to kill again Or they get caught 'cause they were distracted by a nosh - Ooh! - Grace! Oh, Miss Karen, can I stop for a minute? My back is hurting Keep goin'. I didn't hear anything snap This year I'm making your figgy pudding with rat poison and Ajax But no raisins!

'Cause I pay my babysitters just like I pay my whores you gets your money whether you like it or not No, Karen, I really like Olivia That little girl you had no interest in raising is turning out to be an amazing woman you'll never know Huh. Well I've got a couple hours free this afternoon I'll take her off your hands.

Sorry Oh, hi, Mom Okay, sure Grace, my-- my mom's on her way up Why is she here? She knows. How does she know? I'm outta here. Forward my mail Grace, Grace. Grace What are you worried about? You didn't do anything Right? Right So anything she has to say about the fate of her figurine is new information, and should be met with shock. Let's try it Um-- Grace, my Lladro is broken Dear God, no! Yeah, you're.. you're mildly surprised, not being asked to give money to charity Hi, Mom Hi, Marilyn. Tea was so great yesterday. How are you? - Not very good - What's wrong? I have some very sad news, Will. Fiona was cleaning after the party yesterday.. and she found Wi-San in pieces on the floor Wi-San is dead, Will She's dead! Wi-San? Well, she sounds like somebody who's ready to go anyway She was a very rare Lladro figurine And somebody broke her Oh, I bet it was that Skippy Faber, the clumsy drunk Grace, you were talking to her Was she slurring? Uh, a little But I really couldn't tell 'cause she was stumbling around and waving her arms I knew it! I am going to wait until April and pour bleach on her roses Well, hey, that's something to look forward to I'm just going to splash some cold water on my face, and then I'll be going This is perfect! This is what happens when you keep your mouth shut. Skippy Faber takes the fall! So, that's it? I just let Skippy hang for my crime? Ah, she's German We'll just call it even Do you know what? It could-- it could not have been Skippy Because I remember refilling the cashews right after she left, and Wi-San was fine Bashful, but fine Well, whatever. The important thing is it's over and it doesn't matter. Oh, yes it does, Someone came into my house, destroyed something beautiful, and didn't even have the decency to admit it Ooh. I am not going to rest until I find them and pour bleach on something they love Now I'm sorry I bought these jeans I think they make me look like I'm not starving myself They do too. I mean, any one of us would kill to have your body - Kill. - I am so serious Thanks, Olivia, thanks, Maisie, thanks, Ruby. Boy, how cool are we, huh?

I'm gonna get us all some beers Oh, what am I talkin' about? Some light beers What are you doing? I was hangin' out with my stepdaughter You're embarrassing me! And that's hard to do. I was dropped off at school by a 700-pound man - I gotta go. My friends are waiting - Fine! Good riddance Besides, I'm gonna go pick up some lithographs at Z Gallerie Wow That was just like "The O.C." Only without 25-year-old teenagers and 35-year-old parents Well, my Holidays Around the World potluck was a rousing success Except when Egypt and Israel fought over the Suez cannoli Hi, Mom. Hi, Fiona Hello, Darling. Grace? - You remember Fiona, my housekeeper - Mm? Well, I-I shouldn't say housekeeper She's been with us so long, she's more like family Not really Nice to see ya! - Oh, you're lookin' fit - Well, thank you And we came into town just to do a little shopping and, uh.. Oh, golly. Oh, golly Where's my other bag? I must've left it in the lobby I'll get it. You visit with your son Oh, you are such a wonderful woman. I.. I swear I don't know what I would do without you I need you to fire her, Will - What?! Why? - Well, I figured it out She broke the Lladro! Here's your scotch I wanted a hot cider Oh. Here's your hot cider Karen. Why are you making Olivia leave? Well, she doesn't want to be around me, I don't want to be around her - I don't - Yeah? Well then, get riddance! Don't let the door, or the gate, or the other door, or the security laser hit you on the way out! This is crazy. Olivia Karen cares about you. She always has - No, she doesn't - No, I don't She'd never tell you this herself, but she's always done a lot of nice things for you - No, she didn't - No, I haven't When you were a little girl, your favorite show was "Step by Step." Did you know that Karen paid.. for that show in production two extra seasons just so you could watch it? - She did? - Yes! Now, damn it you two care about each other. But you're too stubborn to admit it Now, I am gonna lock myself out.. on that bitterly cold terrace for as long as it takes for you guys to work it out in this warm, comfortable, cozy room Got it? WellI better go - Olivia? - Yeah? I'm sorry that I wasn't a very good stepmother You're all right Like, remember that time when we glued the cookie to the floor and watched Mason get splinters trying to pick it up? And then Stanley showed him how to pry up the floorboards and eat 'em both together I miss Dad Yeah. I miss him too, Honey You have his eyes, you know Except.. yours aren't on the sides of your head Listen, Come on, why don't you stay? We can do somethin' fun like roast chestnuts and then throw 'em at Rosario. Come on That sounds fun Okay You guys worked it out yet? It's really chilly out here! Mom, e-even if Fiona did break the Lladro, I can't fire her she's been with us forever. She's like a mother to me. Sorry I know. I know, Darling That's all right I went through quite a funk after I had you I-I wouldn't pick him up for a year And I don't care what the book said, I still think that was right thing to do Um, Marilyn, I know this isn't any of my business.. I can't imagine anyone who's less involved than I am But, um-- accidents happen You're not really gonna fire her, are you? You know, I trust everyone implicitly. Until they betray that trust And then they are dead to me forever I'm just going to wait back here Will, take care of it Why me? It's easier for you. You're cold, like your father I am much too warm I am not gonna fire Fiona. You have to tell Mom that you did it Yes, my mom will torture you forever. But what's worse? That, or the knowledge that you cost an innocent woman her livelihood? Well, when you put it like that, I guess the choice is pretty clear - Hello, hello - You're fired - What? - N-n-no, you're not! Yes, you are. Get out, you Lladro-breaking leprechaun. Hey, hey, hey, hey, stop it! Stop it! You monster. You are not fired. Mom! Mom, Grace did it! Grace broke the Lladro! I knew it, I knew it all along - What? You knew? - Oh, give me a little credit. Grace had her paws in the cashews all afternoon So this was--this was all a game? - You, you were playing us? - Yes Marilyn, I am so sorry I broke it. And I'm so sorry I didn't tell you I'm sorry too Although, any wrong doing on my part can probly be traced to the fact that I had no human contact for the first year of my life Oh, Marilyn, I hope that we can put this behind us Hm. We can Let's pretend it never happened Come on, Fiona, let's go. Oh! Before I forget Happy holidays, Grace The chocolates you loved at my house - Thank you - Enjoy Will, see, your mother can forgive and forget I wouldn't ÀÚ¸· Á¦ÀÛ - ³×ÀÌÆ® µå ó¸  24 ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Á °ÇºÎ ¹èÆ÷ / ¼öÁ¤ ±ÝÁö ¹èÆ÷½Ã ÀÚ¸· ÃâÃ³¸¦ ²À ¹àÇô ÁÖ¼¼¿ä

Oh, dear. Did you call out my name again the boudoir? You know that guy at the gym-- th-the trolly muscle queen with no neck? Oh, the one that you were obsessed with, who would never go out with you?

Like an onion My therapist tells me that your compliments are actually blows to my psyche Well, forgive for being proud of you, mybig, strong, sensitive cop Tiny emotional punches You know, you're working over my super-ego l-l-like it's a side of beef William, would you like to join us for the 11:10 a.m. screening of Spanglish? Which is Spanish for "English" I have to go to work It's a big day, actually There's a-a reporter coming to my office to interview Karen He's doing an article on female CEOs Well, it's for Parade magazine, so it's probably female CEOs who collect commemorative coins Karen was interviewed yesterday at my office Well, not so much "interviewed," as a corrections officer came over and told her to pee in a cup and give a hair sample I gotta go. Call me later How 'bout you, Vince? Would you like to come with us to see Spanglish, starring Paz Vega? Paz Vega is Spanish for Ashley Judd I, uh-- I gotta go to work Maybe some other time Did you see that? She completely dismissed us! Well, I for one will not be ignored Oh, I'm sorry, What'd you say?

I am good with reporters Ever since I leaked a little information to Woodward and Bernstein, I've had 'em eating out of my hands Do you really expect me to believe that you were Deep Throat? Only to one of them Hello. Uh, Frank Woolley, Parade Magazine Hi, Will Truman. I'm Ms. Walker's lawyer And Parade reader since 1978 Well, I've been--I've been throwing it out of my Sunday paper since 1978 I use mine to wrap fish You're too kind, you're too kind Ms. Walker, Frank Woolley I'm so excited that you're gonna be the first interview for my new, uh, hard-hittin' shoot-from-the-hip column, "Always Woolley." "Always Woolley"? Wouldn't "Always Frank" be better? What would that mean? Miss Walker, I know you're busy, so let's-- let's get, uh, right to the nitty-gritty Now, I hope you that some of my questions are a little bit, uh, Woolley Now, you see, a-another place wh-where "Frank" would be just as good, if not better. You know? Nothing you say makes sense to me Mr. Truman do you-- Do you need to be here for this? Oh, I-I know it's just a puff piece, but I-- You know, I thought I best sit in, just in case there's any legal questions Pretend I'm not here Oh, hey, Wilma. When'd you get here? See? It's easy Uhnow, Ms. Walker the slant of this piece is female CEOs Uh, when you married Stanley, did you, uh, ever imagine that one day you'd end up on top? Oh. Honey, when I married Stanley, being on top was the only we could do it. He was a very fat man Umoh. I thought you might need a, uh, photo of Karen for the article This is-- this is a photo of you Is it? Oh. Would you look at that? Why don't you just keep that in ca-- Y-you might wanna-- You might wanna do a sidebar about-- about her lawyer You know, "Where There's a Will, there's a Way." Gee, I hate to be that guy, but, uh I'm just not gettin' ya But you know what? A sidebar, that's not a bad idea Could you, uh, give me a 500-word bio on you? Well, the--the ones I have printed up were all 750 words But I can make some trims Okay. Ha. Now let's you and I talk about somethin' fun Hit me, Stretch Okey-dokey. "Stretch." Uh, here Where's the kookiest place that you've ever taken the company jet that wasn't work-related? Wait a minute. I see what you're trying to do You are trying to get me to take you to lunch in Barbados, and it has worked! Let's go! O-o-okay. Uh, but only if you promise on the way to tell me your, uh, nuttiest, uh, insider trading stories I've got some doozies! But hold on a second Let me grab some petty cash from the employee pension plan Grace, hurry up I hate getting to the movies late I need a good angle to set up my video camera Pirating the movie? That's illegal Oh, I don't point it at the screen I tape my own reaction and watch it at home later Yeah. Now, come on, hurry up Okay, okay. I just want to buy something sticky that I can spill on the seat in front of me so no one'll sit there Oh, my God. Look at that guy over there He looks like an Indian version of Vince That is Vince But you know what, you're right From this angle, he could be in the chorus of Bombay Dreams Well-- I don't understand why he lied to us He said he had to work Does he not like us? That's impossible I've been popular my entire life Except for those two years in junior high when my head-gear was attached to my scoliosis brace I looked like scaffolding Kids used to hang out on me and smoke What-- What's he doing? What's with all the touching? Vince, fix your shirt Is that why they fired you from being a cop? Because you don't know how to tuck? Now, you have a bright future here at the market if you just learn to play by the rules Here, come here He's all over him Is-- Is he cheating on Will? Grace, no You're reading too much into it He has his hands down Vince's pants Yes. And if they were straight guys, I would definitely agree that they're having an affair But for gay guys, a hand down the pants just means hello, good-bye and peace It's our shalom I'm gonna talk to him W-w-wait. No, no, no Before you do that, just think about it If you're right and is cheating on Will, then it will probably come out at some point But if you're wrong, there's nothing going on-- we're stuck talking to Vince! You're right, it's none of our business Oh, Will. Hey, there you are Listen, we have got a major catastrophe going on Look, he was elected We just have to accept it and move on. Hmm? Listen, no, someone's planning a hostile takeover of Walker. Inc Oh, my God! When did this happen? Just now. This guy wants to buy out the whole corporation You could lose your biggest client I'm sorry, I shouldn't be smiling, but, uh, we're both up for partner this year I came as soon as I heard Someone's after Stan's company I will not let that happen I built that company from the waist down Who--who's behind this? Well, I don't know, but he's in your office Oh, and, uh, tell him good luck I mean, go get 'im! Hello, Karen It's the reporter! I'm not a reporter And my name's not Frank Woolley That was just an alias that I used to get close to you My real name is Scott Woolley You know, when people want to hide their identity, they usually change their last name And what would be the point of that? Hey. What is your game, Mister? Why are you trying to take over my company? - You don't recognize me? - Nope Why don't you take off the fake nose and the buck teeth? It was in high school I was running for student body president I was so popular and good-lookin' that nobody dared oppose me Except one girl A shy, mousy flat-chested wallflower Wow, this story is not the way I expected We had to debate in front of the whole school I walked in, confident, cool, meticulously prepared And then she walked in-- Overnight this mealy-mouthed waif had sprung gi-normous bazongas Uh, the likes of which, uh, you never see in high school Ah. Back on track. Yeah I took horse vitamins The very first question was, "What would to improve school morale?" I laid out a brilliant five-point plan Karen offered her seven-point plan She repeated my five points, then raised her blouse, revealing points six and seven I won by a landslide! But that was high school Who doesn't have a few bad memories? I mean, one bad perm and your nickname is Greg Brady for four years I have devoted my entire life towards getting revenge At first, I tried living well, but it turns out that's really not revenge at all But then I read that Stanley Walker had died, and that his widow was gonna be the president of the company Suddenly, I saw my chance Uh, yeah. Scott, I don't know how familiar you are with corporate takeovers but, uh, you can't just waltz in and buy out a company It's, uh, it's a little more complicated than that, cowboy I have amassed a fortune of $500 million dollars And I've spent the last couple of years driving down her stock price so that I could take a controlling interest And this is gonna be the tenth company that I've done that to Yeah, I know. I just mean there's gonna lot of paperwork Ladies and gentlemen of the board, Walker, Inc. is in a shambles And the woman to blame for that is Karen Walker Her tenure as CEO has been marred by mismanagement, corporate malfeasance-- And in one instance, uh, public drunkeness at the Central Park Zoo? Hey! That goat stole my flask What was I supposed to do, not punch it? Yeah, I'd like to call for an immediate vote-- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down there, Captain Slick It's easy to tear somebody down, but where is your plan? I--I have yet to see any evidence that you have a vision for this company th-th-- Who are these men with these notebooks that say "Vision" on them? Ladies and gentlemen, you have before you now my 100 point plan for the revitalization of Walker, Inc Oh, yeah? Well, I've got a 102-point plan - Jack? - Oh! What? I--I got your text message "Mince is fleeting." What does that mean? It means my thumbs are too big for my Blackberry - Vince is cheating - How do you know? Look at them A platonic cupping of the crotchal area is one thing, but to touch a man's hair? They've gone all the way It's okay, but you are half an inch away from a hair net, buddy Yeah. Touch my hair again, I'll put a booger in the olive bar Hi, Vince Aaaah! Oh, God Grace, you startled me This place is crawling with rats Wait, what, what are you doin' here? - We know what's goin' on - Yeah, we know your filthy secret Vince. I want your ass in aisle five And bring the mop Oh, my God What kind of a place is this? And why do I shop anywhere else? Wait, you work here? Yeah. What'd you think I was doin'? Oh, certainly not meeting your rough trade grocery store lover for a quick handy by the bed of crackers Vince, what's going on? I got fired I'm not on the force anymore Remember last week, a guy robbed a department store and the cop accidentally shot the cashier? - That was you? - No, that was my partner I was busy tryin' on gloves Since it was my 63rd citation, and my seventh one involving, you know, gloves they fired me Oh dear, you poor thing What color were they? Taupe with a chocolate cashmere lining Oh, they woulda gone with everything Well-- Will doesn't know? No, I can't-- I'm too embarrassed Look at me. I went from a-- from a real gun to a--to a price gun You know, yesterday I busted some guy shoplifting All I could two mark him "two for a dollar" and send him on his way - Why, you woulda shot him? - I woulda had the option Vince. Will loves you You could tell him anything And you shouldn't feel bad about working here I mean, every job has its own dignity Thanks, Grace Well, that's what I was thinkin' I'm tryin' to stay rosette about the whole thing - You slacking off again? - Why don't you lay off, you little bitch, before I rip your head off your neck - You're fired - What? Why?! I have no idea But if you need me, I'll be in aisle five Well, thank you, everyone I trust that what I've shown you today will help you to make an informed decision about the future of Walker, Inc Very impressive presentation, Ms. Walker I hadn't seen 'em in a while They still look like a tenth grader's That's because they are. Shh! Thank you both. If you could just give us a minute to vote? Uh, I'm afraid your efforts aren't gonna make any difference I'm still gonna win I stomped your client back into the Ice Age After today, they're gonna be calling me The Scotty Mammoth Why wouldn't you just say "Woolley mam--" Oh, never mind We've taken a vote We've decided to go with Scott Woolley That is not you Uh, Karen? I was worried that after all these years, um, my revenge would empty and hollow But-- I was wrong It's awesome! I'm gonna start moving into your late husband's office So now it's your turn to cry, uh, to wet yourself a little, and, uh, get beaten up by the marching band Not that any of those things happened to me Karen, this is not over Sure he has brains and his fancy folders And all we've got is--is your breasts But-- Yeah, this is probably over That's sweet of you to say, Wilma But I'm just gonna say goo to the board I--I'm sorry, everybody. I just-- I just wanted to say that, um-- Well, I'm a little hurt. I mean, I-- I really thought that we were a family Clive I was there for the birth of your cocaine habit Watching it grow over these past eight years I've never been prouder And Jim. Oh, gosh I remember the third anniversary of your S & M affair with old Charlotte here Never told either of your spouses 'Cause that's what family does They keep secrets Secrets that I am no longer under any obligation to keep Well, like at last year's executive retreat, when Lynette and I-- - I'd like to vote again - Me too - All in favor of Karen Walker, say "Aye." - Aye All opposed? Man. That is one sweet office that Stanley Walker had Although I might replace the omelet station with a-- oh, I don't know-- a computer Sorry, Scott The board has reconsidered Ms. Walker is once again the president of Walker, Inc What? Why? Don't tell him No, no, no! Y-y-you can't do that Those--those folders were expensive Why? Why? Well, it looks like it's time for you to go back where you came from Beam me up, Woolley!

Let's get out of here before clothes start flying off I know I'm a little older than you expected But if it makes you feel any better I've looked the same way since 1948 I love the way you've decorated, Margot It's, uh, very elegant - But then, you're an elegant woman - Look, Gary, Roz, get off my leg There's no reason to suck up You don't need to be worried that whoever doesn't make partner tonight is gonna be fired from the firm Because that is not for sure So how do you fit into this group? Oh, well, my friend Will works at the firm Do you know Margot well? You could say that I'm her husband Old and married Wow, I feel like Cinderella I must say this tapestry of tension I've created is making me weak in the knees And it's working its way up Ooh, uh, I'll get it. I'm sure it's Vince Ah, two gay men in my apartment It's like the '70s again Thank God, you're here! If you were any later - you'd have really embarrassed me - I got fired! What?! What happened? They had these diamond covered gloves and I was trying them on What the hell is with you and gloves?! Oh, Will You're not gonna believe this but I'm gonna love telling you Seems Nicole and Margot went to the same all-girls' school Gave me a solid academic background and half a dozen character-building lesbian experiences Well, Vince and I aren't lesbians but we, uh, don't have much sex anymore so that's close Is that--isn't that right, Vince? Huh, Vince? Huh? Oh, I'm sorry I was just, uh-- I was just, uh I was just thinking that I'm lost and I'll probably never work again You must think I'm pretty pathetic Eh I love Margot I'll never move on Maybe you will Maybe you won't Do you know what's for dinner? I don't care I'd sleep on the guest bed that the cats pee on just to be near her Yeah Is there any chance we've been talking for three hours? It sounds like you're getting a bit mad at me No, I'm not mad It's just that, you know you're a little frustrating - You wanna take it out on me? - Huh? Spank me I am so glad we could do this tonight Because I think of the firm as a family And there is nothing more important than family - Well, speaking of family-- - Shh What? It's great news We're having a baby No, we're not Nothing's definite I might not keep it A baby! Congratulations That is wonderful news Do you wanna adopt? I need an answer right now You're going to a terrific mother, Roz And now, let's all sit down to dinner Oh, not you, Roz. You can go home What? Well, you're not going to be partner And this has nothing to do with those silly studies that say a mother is less productive in the workplace But there are of those studies and they all say the same thing Honey, where the hell have you been? You know that when I drop by unexpectedly I like for you to be here so that you can say something stupid and I can say something about recreational drugs! Didn't you get any of my messages? Rosie is in surgery! If they can get her boobs above her waist they deserve a Nobel prize. Karen, this isn't a joke! She could die! She has tonsillitis! You hear me? Tonsillitis! Okay, I see what she's doing She's faking so that she can get her tonsils taken out and sell them to Japanese people as an aphrodisiac Well, I've just raced home to get a nurse's best friend-- her Patch Adams nose Thank God, I keep a bowl of them by the door Now, Karen, you should come with me And why would I do that? To show her that you care for her and that you love her You take that back! Oh, I know what this is People avoid sick loved ones so they don't have to face the idea of losing them Saw it all the time in the hospital That's why when I was a nurse whenever somebody died I hid them under the bed - Now, are you coming? - No! And you can tell that package of assorted chicken parts she better get her thighs and her giblets back to work or she can find another coop to sleep in Chicken! It is a shame I am the only one taking this seriously Not that I'm not enjoying my fantasy date but don't you think we should join everyone for dinner? Oh, she doesn't let me eat with her And since you're my date you don't get to eat either - Probably makes you mad - It does make me mad - Mad enough to spank me? - No, Leonard, I'm not gonna spank you But you want to Because I remind you of every weak man who's ever let you down That's true And you'd like to hit these men, wouldn't you? No-o! Although there are a lot of them and they would deserve it - So just try it - No! Heh, you're divorced, aren't you? Thank you What was it, another woman? Leonard I'm gonna need you to stand like this And brace yourself So I don't ride anymore - but we still stable a horse in Millbrook - Hmm Vince, you--you were on mounted duty for awhile, right? Yeah. I had a horse named Snowflake Real smart. During the Republican Convention he ran right past the protestors and took a crap in front of Zell Miller Ha ha. That is officially my favorite story of the evening Excuse me Looks like someone made a new friend Snowflake was like a brother to me I wonder what he's doing now Well, whatever it is, I'm sure he's-- he's the glue that holds the precinct together God, I miss that horse! Will you excuse me? Well I'll be right back, I-- Remember before, when the horse took a crap in front of Zell Mi-- I'll be right back Get it together! Forget about Snowflake Snowflake is dead Snowflake is dead?! Oh! No!

In a minute I just-- I think I just made-- I said now! Oh, my God.

So, take a bow Get back to work What? Rosie doesn't want you here so why don't you just go-- She can stay Once again, sweetheart it is so hard to hear you! She can stay Chicken steak?

I'm done I don't know what you're talking about, honey Nobody named Osment called and I never promised nobody nothin', ya hear? Look, he gave me an ultimatum He said I either fire you or I lose the job And he was talking about opening these restaurants all over the country I mean, I could be the designer of Woolley's Revenges everywhere "Woolley's Revenge"? I know, bad name I go straight to "diarrhea." Wait a minute, wait a minute Honey, this guy that you're working for describe him to me Oh, I don't know Really tall, long-limbed, attractive Kinda like a big sexy whooping crane?

Thanks for coming I'm not here to see you I'm here to do an interview for the premiere issue of Briefs a magazine for cute gay lawyers Which I just realized does not exist You'd think I'd been tipped off when the message was left by managing editor Pat McGroin At your service, laddie - I don't have time for this - No, no, no, but wait, wait I wanna be here for you Now, come, come, sit I reserved a nice quiet table in the corner for us to talk for as long as you need Yeah, until a cute guy walks by or you notice your reflection in a spoon No. Now I can be a good friend Now, I would like to hear everything that's going on with you - You would? - I would You must be serious The word "would" was just used three times, and you didn't giggle Okay It's, uh I don't know, it's--it's been hard Wow, still no giggle It just--it's, likeit's-- What Vince and I had just felt so right And you're wondering if you're ever gonna find that again Yeah, I am I mean, it's like, am I even capable of having a relationship? Of course You just haven't found anyone who's good enough for you yet Thanks Oh, you know, I should wash my hands The subway stopped short, and I accidentally put my finger in an old man's ear I'll be right back Okay, and I'll be waiting right here As far as I'm concerned, we're the only two people in the whole world I have a reservation for tea Patti LuPone Miss Adler I can only assume that this means that you've fired Karen Walker I did. But I'd really rather not talk about it It's just too upsetting Oh, yes. No, I understand Um, so how did she take it? Um, maybe not well? She was devastated She said that that job was the most important thing to her in the world Go on, go on Keep going, don't mind me I may close my eyes a little bit, go ahead After that, she became violent I had to have her arrested Then when the police where shoving her into the squad car they accidentally ripped her ear off They were gonna try and put it back on, but a dog ran up and ate it Wow, that sounds like, uh, her life is ruined - Does it sound like that to you? - It does But to Karen it only sounds half as bad because she only has one ear I feel just awful Oh. You know what a sad occasion like this calls for? A glass of 1954 Salon le Menuille The world's most expensive champagne I've waited so long for this moment No champagne will ever taste as sweet It tastes like cat pee! That's because it is Miss LuPone, I just wanna say I saw you in Evita when I was 16 I came out by intermission I hear that a lot Sometimes I think I'm personally responsible for the West Village By the way, you look fabulous Thanks.

Oh, don't talk like that You are smart, good-looking, rich Don't waste all your energy on Karen Just let it go I can't! She's all I think about I imagine what she's doing every moment of every day I look for her in crowds I listen for her voice When I'm pulling a pineapple cake out of the oven I'm thinking, "Is she doing the same thing?" If I didn't know any better I'd say that you had a little crush on her No, I just told you. I hate her She's evil and monstrous and cold - And sexy? - So hunkin' sexy Oh my God in heaven You may be right I think I-- I do have a little-- a little crush on her See, now you don't have to devote your entire life to ruining her Oh, you're so right.

                    			Wow, look at this place! Someone either has an admirer or they just won the Kentucky Derby And Grace's legs are spattered with mud Who's all this from? And why are they sending you men's clothes? Wait, these aren't all from Scott Woolley? Yeah, my former nemesis is in love with me It just keeps happening First Anita Bryant, now this guy Well, I said the same thing to him I said to Anita: "Squeeze your own oranges!" Besides I met someone - Really? - You did? / Tell us Yes, we met online We've been exchanging messages for a few weeks and he's funny and charming and He says he's fat Really fat! I don't know, Karen You gotta be careful You can't trust people you meet on the Internet I went on a date with this guy I met online, and he seemed really nice But at the end of the evening, I stole $200 from his wallet You know, and people lie all the time, so don't get your hopes up He's probably not as fat as he says he is WellI guess we'll find out soon enough I invited him out to Shelter Island to our country club's annual Valentine's Day dance I'll know him because he's going to be wearing a green string around his wrist Yeah, 'cause you wouldn't want to walk up to the wrong 500 pound man Àª Àª & Àª & ±× Àª & ±×·¹ Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º ½ÌÅ© Á¦ÀÛ ÇÑ±Û ¹ø¿ª ½ÌÅ© ÆíÁý ÃÖÁ¾ Å×½ºÆ® Ohh I wonder if my date's here yet Oh, my God Check out the chunk of a hunk in the black suit with the big, white smile Oh, I hope that's him That's a piano Where the hell are all the queers you promised us, Karen?! God, even the waiters are straight It's unnatural Oh, honey Black, white, gay, straight-- What's the difference? We all finish ourselves off in the end anyway That's lovely I'd almost forgotten it was Valentine's Day Jack, be patient It could still happen The next guy you see could turn out to be Mr. Right Well, well, well Or maybe not - Why, Beverley Leslie - Karen Walker Just breaks my heart that you don't have a partner for the spotlight dance How ever will you lead it without a partner? Such a pity a bottle of rum can't waltz Actually, I do have a date Yes, I was just on my way to meet him by the punch bowl Or, as you would call it, the swimmin' hole You know, Jack, I think you're right No one's gay. And everyone's so old There isn't a neck here you couldn't jump rope with Oh, my G-dash-D You'll never guess who's here! Greg Evigan from TV's "BJ and the Bear," and then, after a brief hiatus, "My Two Dads"? You know, I never realized just how gay both those titles are It's a wonder he didn't go on to star in "Hey, Faggot!" Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Pay attention! It's that long-limbed lothario Scott Woolley Look at him over there, fingering my date Happy Valentine's Day! Oh, Brad, you said there was a party It's just a lonely old woman sitting at her desk Hey, hey, hey! I don't normally sit here My desk is there And the party's upstairs - Where is everybody? - Wrong floor The stupid party celebrating the meaningless day is upstairs I take it you're not a big fan of Valentine's Day I think it is a ridiculous, trumped-up-- exceedingly handsome, chiseled holiday Yeah, I agree It is the most chiseled of all the major holidays Uh, one flight up Have a good time You know, for someone who hates Valentine's Day it seems like you have an awful lot of admirers Either that, or you're about to die - Oh, wait That's only funny - if you're not about to die Are you about to die? Uh, I don't think so Unless you're here to kill me - Wow. We're in an awkward place - Yeah I'm Nick I'm Grace Now, you listen to me, Woolley! You and me ain't never gonna happen-- Never! Ya hear me?! Get the hell out of here before my date arrives! - Oh, oh, you got a date - Yes, I do. A big one Enormous, actually Uh, 400 pounds, but moves like 380? That's right Loves midnight snacks on the beach, horseback eating, and, uh Will be wearing a green string around his wrist? You're ElevatorHazard at whalewatcher.com? - I hate to point out the obvious-- - I know-- Why is a pretty girl all by herself on Valentine's Day? Yeah. No, actually, I was gonna say you can't possibly eat all those chocolates by yourself Oh! Want one? Yeah Not that one. Or that one No, no, no You know, you just said no to an empty wrapper Well, there's a little coconut on it All right, take it Ohthanks You're obviously not in a festive mood It's just this whole day, it's like an evil conspiracy Created by the greeting card people and the flower people and the candy people Well, not the candy people They doGod's work You know, I, uh, I don't think the card people are that bad, either Oh, they're the worst Reducing love To a cartoon dog holding a bow and arrow, saying, "I love you." Well, you see, this is just a bad card I mean, first of all, he should be saying, "I ruff you." Right? And why is he holding a bow and arrow if you're not gonna do something with it Like, um, uh "You are the target of my love," or, "Your love makes me quiver." Maybe not that one Sounds sexual A little weird coming from a dog How about one with a dog on one side and a lying creep on the other, and inside it says, "Your husband's got a bitch on the side." You know, I can bring that up at the morning meeting, but they tend to frown on calling dogs bitches and vice versa Wait, you're serious? You write greeting cards? Eh, I prefer to think of them as extremely short stories Okay, I'm gonna try and be careful here about what I say next 'cause I don't want to offend you But your job is lame Hmm, and, uh, I'm guessing by the rows of fabric and the tassels, you work for UNICEF? At least I don't perpetuate the myth that if you're not in love in the middle of February that there's something wrong with you Hmm, and the real myth must be that February 14 is the only day you're unpleasant and bitter Whoa You know what? Uh, this is over So why don't you just go up to your party-- - OH! - Ohh! My-- I'm so sorry! Here Have a chocolate Not this one You're not bleeding Where's the bartender?! Why, Karen It's been an hour, and there's still no sign of your date What are you implying, Beverley Leslie? That I lied, that I'm just vamping until I think of my next move? Just trying to fill time by saying meaningless words-- knickknack, lamp shade, hullabaloo, soft shell crab Excuse me My sister wanted me to ask you if you'd be interested in dancing with her-- Lucille, I did not - She wants to dance with you - I did not! I wanted the cute one! No, no, he is the catch He looks just like that young actor from all those magazines What's his name? Sal Mineo Thank you. God, I haven't heard that in over 50 years Well, how can you girls remember Sal Mineo? Why, neither of you look a day over 40 Eh, made 'em happy Didn't cost anything You know what? We would love to dance Oh, why not? We haven't done this in ages I just hope we don't hold you back Oh, nonsense, we'll-- we'll take it slow Five, six, seven, eight! Flim-flam, Ed Bradley, nipple clamp, doo-dah parade Well, I hope your beau shows because if that spotlight finds you all alone my business associate Benji and I will be forced to laugh Roll back and forth on the floor and laugh and just clutch each other and roll and laugh And talk about business Listen, Seed of Chucky, why don't you just leave me alone?! Why don't you make me? I'll make you Aah! If you bother the woman that I love one more time I'm gonna rip out your tiny arms and give 'em to her on a charm bracelet Honey, no one's ever offered to dismember a dwarf and make jewelry out of him for me before Beverley meet Scott Woolley My date - Your date? - Oh! Benji! Benji! He was so big! Really, Karen? I'm your date? Oh, yeah, sure. Why not? Karen, you've made me the happiest man on the face of the earth Oh, honey That's exactly what Anita Bryant said Ow. Ow. That eye stings And it tastes a lot like gin I got it from my assistant's freezer Huh. Is your assistant Courtney Love? Not as together - I am really, really sorry - That's all right You didn't mean it, did you? I mean, you're not homicidal, are you? Because it looks like you've been doing some psychotic gardening Oh, uh, this isn't psychotic This is - Tough year, huh? - Mm-hmm Well, I can sympathize I recently lost my wife Oh, my God. That's just-- I'm so sorry Yeah, the divorce was just finalized last week Divorce? I thought she died! Hey, take it easy There's a music box in that thing Look, I just-- You know what? I, um, I don't like to say "divorce" because it sounds like I did something wrong Whereas if she died, at worst, I'm guilty of negligence Ooh, dark. I like that Look, I don't know if it's the ice cubes talking but would it be crazy if we kissed right now? On Valentine's Day? Can we do that? Isn't that a little cliche? - Where's the party?! - Upstairs Maybe that was a sign That we shouldn't kiss or that you need to get a lock on that door? Both Uh I should probably get back to, um, you know, UNICEF Ah. Well, I guess this makes us star-crossed lovers Oh Yeah, it's really tragic Well, technically it can't be tragic if we haven't kissed That's true Do, um, do star-crossed lovers ever get to see one another again? Hard to say 'Cause, you know, usually one or both of them dies Well, then, let's make sure we eat well and look both ways before crossing - because I'd like to see you again - Me, too Let me help you with the-- - I'll take care of it - Thanks. Okay. Well, well, well I see you boys have met the Portillo sisters They're my favorite members of this club who aren't completely Caucasian Well, they're terrific dancers The only way I could keep up with them is by pretending both of them were drag queens Heaven forbid! As social chair of this club, and board member of the Shelter Island Republican Party I can assure you two men will never dance together on this floor Did I hear you correctly? Could you say that again and tilt your head up? Surely you're aware of the winds of change that are blowing through our fair nation I'm sorry, I'm a wee bit confused Um how can I put this delicately? You're a raging 'mo yourself, no? I don't know what you're insinuating but my precious wife Crystal would be here tonight But I tragically lost grip on her wheelchair while maneuvering her down the 10,000 steps of Chichen-Itza! I absolutely adore you You are the brightest angel in all of heaven Also, I'd like so much, so much, to get into your pants. I would Honey, now, don't make me cry Okay, boys Two Lemon Drops Ah, don't worry about us We don't drink We switched exclusively to pills six years ago Look, we have to go We, um, just found out your club has a policy against gay couples Oh, we know You see, dears, um We tell people we're sisters But we're really sisters Portia de Rossi Degeneres, you're lesbians?! But that's impossible Your makeup is flawless We've been hoping this place would change for 40 years-- / 30 But we see now that it's never gonna happen Yeah, and what's the point in taking a stand? Tragic I know. Sisters and lesbians All right, everyone, it's time for the traditional spotlight dance Okay, honey, we're up! Come on! Okay. Karen, sweetie, just one quick word Thank you This is the first time I've ever felt truly happy Honey, I can't I-I thought you were just a kook, but it turns out you're a sweet kook Honey, I can't do this to you To me, this is just a dance So there's-- There's nothing between us? Nothing And I'm sorry, because I like you Well, liking sometimes blossoms into loving Loving somebody Not this time - What if we-- - Never gonna happen Thank you At least I--at least I got to feel something You're welcome Thank you What's this? Karen Walker without a date? I beg of you to not gawk at her like a hideous circus freak How dare you? I have choked on olives bigger than you! All right, so I'm alone! Again. Go ahead, stare! Or you could stare at this Shall we? - I've been waiting for 40 y-- - 30 Oh, Benji, I can't stand the sight of all this homosexual dancing!

I want my Mint Milano! What are those crumbs on your jacket? Mint Milano Maybe I did eat it Whenever I get together with my friends and we talk about who works for the craziest bitch I always win Karen, I am so sorry about your Peeping Tom The thought that someone would degrade you by viewing you simply as a piece of meat disgusts me You hear that?

Like, never You'll be happy to see neither of those items are on the menu I can't believe you laughed when I fell on the ice I did not laugh at you falling I laughed at the 30 foot slide down the sidewalk that came after Oh, so you think it's funny to see a grown woman sliding on her ass down Lexington Avenue with a cocktail dress over her head? Not as funny as if it was a nun but still pretty funny And, look, I'm sorry I could not find your other shoe I just appreciate you prying this one out of the sewer grate Hi. The fire's toasty It is perfect for a winter day in New York Yeah, are you ready to order? 'Cause I'm not really up for chit-chat I just found out I'm pregnant, and I have a lot of phone calls to make A baby? Ooh Wow, you're so young It's-- That's a tough road ahead Do you have baby back ribs? Mmm, the appetizers look great I think I'm gonna order three of 'em - Oh yeah? Instead of an entree? - What? - What are you doing? - Nothing - You just stole that menu - No, no, no, it's just that-- In case things work out with us one day I could give it to you as a memento from our first date Aww, that is so sweet Grace?

You've been out here for so long You must be freezing - Here, I brought ya some soup - Oh Karen, this is gin There's noodles in it Thanks, Kare, but keep it down, all right? The HGN startles very easily Just admiring him from a distance Quit stalling. You've been observing him long enough - Go ask him out - Okay, okay I just have to approach him delicately and pick up on any subtle cues he may give me Oh, joy! The male warbler is about to start his mating ritual This sublime creature entices his potential mate first by puffing out his chest Then he ruffles his feathers It's his way of flirting Yes, and then, finally he produces a high-pitched warble the beauty of which is unparalleled - What are you doing? - Warbling. You like? Oh, I'm sorry, I haven't properly introduced myself. I'm Jack - Aaron - Yes. So you're a bird watcher I bet you've seen a cockatoo Heh-heh So would you like to have dinner with me sometime? - Oh--oh, uh - Like maybe this Friday? Friday?

I still need you - Okay, then let me join you - No. I don't need you now It's going well But it's not going so well that I'm in danger of throwing myself at him But it's going well enough that I still want to be alone with him When I'm just at the point where it might be going too well when I really want to throw myself at him which is exactly when I don't want to throw myself at him that's when I'm gonna need you I hate that I completely understood what you just said Can't you just wait a few more minutes? You have the best table in the restaurant Yes, if you enjoy dining on the sun Look at me, Grace! My back is sweating so much my underwear is like a bucket! Please, Will I think I might really like him Okay Here's a dry spot Thank you I'm timing you. Five minutes Oh, great, my watch slipped off!

You know what? I think I'm gonna ask him to join us You know, before you do I just wanna do this And this What? / And I thought my hot flashes were bad Excuse me, Sir Is everything okay here? Actually, no Would it be possible to move to another table and away from this one which is apparently the portal to Satan's lair? Sir, you're either going to have to put your clothes back on, or leave Okay, fine. I'll get dressed I'm just about to join my friends over there any-- Way Oh, you gotta be kidding me! Karen! I can't believe you killed it How could you give a bird alcohol? Well, it was a lot harder than you think At first, I tried to pin it down with an ashtray and pry open its beak with a pair of ice tongs, but ultimately, I just dunked it head-first into my glass All right, well Clearly nobody's at fault here There is a Hot Gay Nerd here to see you I've never seen one up close before They're quite spectacular Oh, my God, it's him! What do we do? I have an idea! Vamp! Whore! No, vamp Stall him for a little while I'll be right back Jack! Karen told me that you found the warbler I am so excited! Which, for me, is dangerous 'cause I was born with my heart on the outside of my chest But you know what? You have made me the happiest man alive who was never supposed to live past 17 Aaron, I'm supposed to vamp, but-- One, I don't feel comfortable lying to you and two, I don't have my lipstick or my boa - You have bad news? - Oh, no, it's not what you think - Is it that my bird is dead? - Oh, it's exactly what you thought Oh! God! Why? This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me since I saw Big Bird smoking a cigarette with his head off Honey, great news Your bird isn't dead He's alive And more beautiful than ever - Oh, my God. Let me see - You won't be disappointed. Ta-da! What is this? It's your bird Don't you recognize it? It's got 78,000 feathers And $100 in iTunes Karen! Shame on you! The Hot Gay Nerd cannot be bought He is a man of science Good news I gave the little fella a couple of sips of coffee a few slaps across the face, and he came to - He's alive in the kitchen! - Back off, that's not my bird This is my bird You are not the rare Hot Gay Nerd Why you are the very common Hot Gay Opportunist Are you saying you don't want to go out with me? Well, you've just shown some very unattractive qualities But fortunately, you still retain the one that I hold nearest to my heart Hot Come on Let's go spend that bird - How could you leave me like that? - Will, listen-- No. You listen I was doing you a favor And how was I rewarded? By being ditched, then burning off my eyelashes On the roaring fire next to my table? Ironically, no On the small votive candle in the men's room while I was wringing out my pants in the sink! Look, Will, I know that you're mad but you really, really did help me tonight Oh, please! Don't even try that with m-- How? You made me realize that I shouldn't need someone else to help me control myself After dinner, he dropped me off, asked me for another date we had a kiss of appropriate length, and I came home - You didn't sleep with him? - I did not - Or let him feel you up in the cab? - Only because he said I was pretty I'm only kidding Nothing happened Well. I'm proud of you And it's all because of you - I'm going to bed - Me too - Good night - Good night Oh, just one more thing Hey It's tough to get a cab out there / Hm - Say good night to Nick, Grace - Good night.

No, Nick, that's so cool! - You really think so? - No. What am I supposed to say? So, what'd you think?! - About what? - Our new show just premiered on OutTV! You watched it right?

There's a crucifix behind every piece of furniture Okay, the twist in this story is both the mother and the daughter are whores Can I help you? Dear God, tell me you're not Pastry Chef Yeah, I'm Edward Forgive the appearance. I don't like to be constrained by clothing while I bake If the health department would let me, I'd bake in the nude Maybe you should send the health department a picture They might make an exception. Uh, ahem! I'm--I'm Will Truman, Karen Walker's attorney - There's no easy way to say this-- - Taste this That is the perfect combination of sugar, lemon zest and finger - So what can I do for you? - Well, I, uh, came here to, um-- Do you even like your job? Yeah, I love my job. I mean, it's my life And without it, I'd be deported Somebody works out, huh? I thought lawyers were supposed to pass the bar, not lift it I'm dirty, and I don't even care God, it smells so good in here! I've only been here five minutes, and already I could eat everything in sight See, for me, the joy isn't in the eating It's in the making. Here That's it Now put your body into it You're very good at this Have you ever kneaded something before? Never more than right now! Uh, Jack, there's a Grace Adler here to see you Thank you, Elizabeth Just show her in, please Uh, you know my name's Dave, right? Listen, it's bad enough I'm the only one here with a straight assistant Do not make me call you that ridiculous name! - Yeah, but-- - That will be all, Elizabeth! I-- I am impressed! Out TV is real I mean, all those people you said you work with, I can see them too I know, isn't it great, Grace? And look-- check out this phone I have full access to lines one and two, whenever they're not in use All I have to do is fill out a form, submit it for approval, and within 24 hours I may or may not be talking to someone Wow. You know, I can sort of do the same thing on my cell phone But you don't have the forms So what can I do for you, Grace? What's the news on the Rialto? UmI'm here about Nick Uh, he wants to break into TV writing And so he gave me this script to pass along to you. Will you read it? Of course I will, dear Is it any good? Oh, is it any good? It's--it's touching, heartwarming, and I know that this is a cliche but it--it made me wanna be a better person - You didn't read it, did you? - No, but I told him I did What if I read it and I don't like it? I mean, it could ruin my entire relationship And it's not like that didn't happen before - When I was in college, I dated-- - A homo? No! A guy in a rock band And I went to see him, and it turned out he was-- - A homo? - No! He was terrible And it was a big turnoff, and I dumped him, and I don't wanna do the same thing to Nick. So please read it Sure thing. But, Grace Where's that guy from the rock band now? - I don't know - Grace Where is he? He's a chorus boy on the Queen Mary II - William, I need to speak with you! - Hey, Karen So I get a hankering to go out to Fortunoff's in Manhasset to buy colorful plastic plates But when I get out to the helipad to take the chopper, what do I discover? Helicopter Pilot has been fired Okay, I thought it was okay to fire Helicopter Pilot seeing as--as you don't own a helicopter - You said you were gonna fire Pastry Chef! - Yes, about that, I gave it some thought, and as your lawyer, I believe that in these uncertain times, having a pastry chef on permanent staff just makes solid economic sense What? There is something going on here I smell liquor on my breath You're drunk! No, Karen, I just-- I met him, and I watched him work The man is a genius. He's--he's an artist I mean, would you fire Picasso? I would, and I did! He put both breasts on one side of my body I wouldn't take it from Plastic Surgeon, and I wouldn't take it from him! Karen, I strongly recommend that you keep this man on staff, and that you give him the weekend off in case someone wants to take him to Montauk Wait a second. I think I see what's going on here You are looking out for my best interest Thank you! Ah, you're welcome. Oh, and on a completely different topic, could I borrow your place in Montauk this weekend? Well, sure, honey take the chopper So, we are here to talk about your script This is the moment of truth - Did you like it? - I wrote it Of course you did! We have to ask. Legal reasons What about you, Jack? Did you like it? I liked some parts Some parts were just okay Some parts were a little tricky What specifically? Okay, well, I really, um I liked the character of, um Fidet Oot That says "Fade Out" - You didn't read it, did you, Jack? - I'm sorry. "Kevin Hill" was on Me digs, Taye Diggs And you're supposed to be a professional Well, thank you for wasting my time Well, I'm sorry! Don't get mad at me Grace didn't read it either I mean, she did read it either Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Damn it, both lines are busy! - Hey, how was the meeting? - It was awful He didn't even read my script! And then he pretended he did Can you believe that? No I mean, what kind of person would do something like that? Jack Let's go to dinner. Come on W-w-wait, Grace. I mean, you read my script, right? Who's your favorite character? My favorite character is you No, no, no, no. I really wanna know Who was it? Jack told me you didn't read the script, Grace I am so sorry It was just that I-- I was scared that I might think it was bad And that it would hurt our relationship, and I like you too much to risk that So, actually, if you think about it, the reason I had for not reading it was actually romantic No, it's not It's incredibly insulting Wait, you can't leave I don't know if I can get out of this skirt by myself Why is Nick so mad at me? I don't deserve this I'm a good person I give and I give and I give - That's mine - Learn from me. Try giving a little! Hello, Grace. I had my meeting with Nick You're welcome What is wrong with you? You told him I didn't read the script?! He told you?! I can't believe that you sold me out! Why didn't you just read it, fool?! All right, here's the thing I was worried that if I didn't like it, it would hurt my relationship with Nick That's my reason! Great! Now he's mad at both of us! What are we gonna do?! Wow, that's a toughie Somebody's mad at you for not reading a script If only there were a way to scan the letters on the page and somehow relay the information to your brain Uh, there is It's called Braille Grace, read the script I know I should, but I'm just-- I'm so worried that I'm not gonna like it It's so heavy It's about euthanasia Oh, really? That's a fascinating issue I've given it some thought, and I think I'd wanna be kept alive, even if it was on machines Yeah, not gonna happen These are so good Where'd you get these? Karen's pastry chef. I was supposed to give him the sack Instead, that's where we ended up I don't know that I approve, Will, unless he's hot Hot? Are you kidding me? He doesn't even have to put the cookies in the oven He just walks by them and winks Wow, so this is your bedroom, huh? Heh, if these walls could talk I guess to you, they do Listen, Karen, there's something I have to tell you I wasn't completely honest about why I couldn't fire Pastry Chef Oh, honey, never mind That's okay You know, after you talked him up so much, I went down the kitchen, and you're right He is very, very talented - Oh, yeah? You think so? - Oh, I absolutely do - What is that? - What? Where? Please tell me a schoolteacher helped you over a fence Oh, my tart's ready. Karen, it was great sexing you just now And, Will, I look forward to sexing you this weekend Nick! I read your script I read your script, and guess what?! - You liked it? - I hated it! But I still like you Isn't that great? No, no, not really. Great would be you like the script and you like me Oh, yeah, I couldn't make that work But this is-- this is good This is really good I like you so much that I can separate you from what you do. This is growth That is good. So maybe, you know, maybe you'll like the next one Ay, there's gonna be another one? Hi, Nick. I don't have much time I didn't fill out a form to be away from the office I read your script, and I loved it! I gave it to my boss, and guess what? We're gonna do it! It's gonna be a movie of the week. An M.O.W., or on our network, an H.O.M.O.W - That's incredible - I told you And you don't have to change a thing Well, except Susan is now Steve, and the hospital is now a gym, and euthanasia is now youth-in-Speedos What the hell is going on here? How could you have sex with her? You're gay! Ah, I don't believe in gay or straight I refuse to limit pleasure I like to think of myself as pansexual Oh, my God, he's been humping my pans "Pansexual"? Isn't that just a rest stop on the highway to homo? Open your mind Sexuality is elastic Look, we're all here We're all human. We're all sex Now, I've been with both of you, and it was fantastic - Thank you - Oh, that's very nice So can you imagine how much better it would be if we were alltogether? Oh, no, no, no, no! No, no If I had to have sex with a woman, it would be Hilary Swank. Or Tobey Maguire Honey, I would love to have sex with two men But one man and Will, no Will, I'm disappointed. I thought me and you had something together You still want to go to Montauk, don't you? Yes Then kiss her But first, to set the mood, I'm gonna put on the most seductive, romantic song known to man Styx, Grand Illusion Welcome to the Grand Illusion Come on in and see what's happening-- Hey, Eddie. You're late You said you'd sex me during "Tic-Tac-Dough." Be right there, senorita Uh, okay, now I am so firing his ass! - Hey - Hey I was just about to call you In honor of your movie of the week, I'm gonna perform my move of the week But first, you are gonna take me out to dinner Well, I've got something to tell you I just came from a meeting at Out TV, and they want me to be there when they shoot the movie - Great - It's in Vancouver Jack told me that it was in New Jersey Yeah, seems a lot of the guys over there didn't know where Vancouver was Well, when do you have to leave? Couple of days. And I'm gonna be gone for, like, three months - I hate the idea of leaving you - No, you gotta do this You got-- You've gotta go I'm gonna miss you, though I am too. Which is really weird, 'cause we barely know each other - Yeah, I know - Why am I so sad? I am too Even Jack feels bad He gave me these forms to fill out so we can talk on the phone So, uh, what are we gonna do? Do you wanna keep this-- Yeah. I'd like to Right, now this is, I mean, this is just like the good-bye scene at the hospital between Susan and Mike Or actually, now I guess it's the dance number at the leather bar between Julio and Evan Hey, wait a second. Aren't we supposed to be going to dinner? Oh, right, you don't leave for three days! "And in conclusion, I look forward to working with you Yours truly, Jack McFarland." Elizabeth, read that back, please Okay. "And in conclusion, I look forward to working with you. Yours truly, Jack McFarland." Good. If I ever have to write a letter, that's how I want it to end ÀÚ¸· Á¦ÀÛ - ³×ÀÌÆ® µå ó¸  24 ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Á °ÇºÎ ¹èÆ÷ / ¼öÁ¤ ±ÝÁö ¹èÆ÷½Ã ÀÚ¸· ÃâÃ³¸¦ ²À ¹àÇô ÁÖ¼¼¿ä   
                




                    			Grace, honest opinion, how does my ass look in these pants? Like two kittens playing in a laundry bag Karen, what are you--Oh, right I forgot that Jack and I are playing Hag Swap. Yeah. If you're expecting me to wet set your hair and give you butterfly kisses at night like Grace doesyou can forget about it! So we were having a meeting with all the executives at Out TV and I had a huge realization That six months ago all of you were cater waiters? That six months from now all of you will be cater waiters? Will, you're mean. Karen, you're hilarious. No, my realization was I'm the only guy there who doesn't own property. So I was thinking of buying a weekend home in Middleborough. Where's Middleborough? Wake up, little Suzy! Middleborough, New York! It's the next big hot gay getaway. You do realize you can't buy a house with box tops and enthusiasm. Remember my aunt who always said she'd help me if I needed it? Well, good news She died! Okay, I guess I'llask the obvious question Since when are gaysallowed to own property? Since we were set free and given Anyway, there's a fantastic house I've had my eye on. Three bedroomsTwo and a half baths I don't know what a half bath is. I think you have to pee in the sink. Honey, if that's true, then all of my bathrooms are half baths. Will, will you come look at it with me this weekend? Real estate's gotnumbers and contracts I'm afraid I'll have to use my brain. Oh, God, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Everyone, look who I ran into! - Hi! - Ellen! I was getting some coffee and she was on her way to the doctor to see about getting her boobs done. - Grace! - Oh, was that a secret? Sorry. One is bigger than the other. Ellen, is that a wise thing to do? I mean, how many months pregnant are you? Zero. Well, that's a bad shirt. You try popping out a few babies and see what kind of shirt you wear. Hey, I popped out two step-children, and I still know how to dress. Look, you're sure it's not a problem for you to watch the kids tomorrow? No problem at all. How hard is it to watch two kids? I have three. Oh, yeah, I forgot about little um Okay, I'll see you later. All right, Ellen. Good luck with the new jug. While you're there, you might have 'em take a nip at the old gobble gobble. - Bye, Ellen. - Bye, Jack. Bye-bye, little guy. Why do I come here? 'Cause it's fun for us. Gobble gobble! Àª Àª & Àª & ±× Àª & ±×·¹ Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Isn't this house cute? I especially love the eaves. I'm all about eaves(Ã³¸ ). - Didn't I tell you it was great? - Yeah you also said the style was Victor-Victorian so I didn't have a lot of confidence. But this place is unbelievable. It's a great price. Doesn't need a lot of work. And reallythis is an up and coming gay hot spot? Oh, please. This place is so gay, the town bird is a condom. Heh heh.. Well, Jack you did great. This house is fit for a queen. Who knew there was an undiscovered jewel like this in upstate New York? You--you should buy it. Guess what? I already did! You did? I can't believe it. I'm kinda jealous. I wish I'd gone in on it with you. Guess what? You already did! - What? - Yeah. Remember that money we set aside for our Fire Island share this summer? You mean where I put in $15,000 and you put in $6 dollars? Put her there, partner. - So your aunt didn't die? - Oh, she did. She's just dirt poor. This is just the kind ofstupid, impulsive-- Oh, my God, I am totally taking my Christmas card picture in front of this fireplace! This is so exciting! We've discovered the new gay getaway. It's like Key West before the first frozen drink washed ashore. (ÇÃ·Î¸®´ÙÀÇ ÈÞ¾çÁö) Oh, look. We're even featured in this month's Details, the official magazine of guys who haven't come out yet. "Real estate insidersare buzzing--" I love buzzing. I've always wanted to be someplace that was buzzing. "The little hamlet where sophisticated urbanites are flocking." Sophisticated urbanites. What a fun way to say "gay"! You know they probably wouldn't ban it if it was called 'sophisticated urbanite marriage' "If you haven't heard of Middleborough, New Hampshire, you soon will." Middleborough, New York. I'm not an idiot. I think I know how to read It says "Middleborough, New Hampshire." Well, that's great. 'Cause we just bought a house in Middleborough, New York! Oh! Honey, look at this place! All ready for the little ones. I had so much fun buying all these kids' toys. And you don't have to wear sunglasses like when you buy adult toys. oh honey, good thinking putting out all this crappy furniture so that the kids can't ruin the good stuff Oh, I'm so excited about being a mom for a day. Oh, honey, they're gonna have a ball with you. And look what I brought! Juice boxes! Huh? Okay, Karen, for the last time, wine is not juice. And a leather whipis not a jump rope Made you jump. Oh, it's that new client. He's always so flirtatious with me. Hi, Eric. No, you're not bothering me at all. I just got out of the shower just wearing a towel. No, no, I'm sorry, I can't meet you. I'm babysitting for some friends. Okay, bye-bye. Oh, my towel just fell. Listen, honey, if you need to start your new job, I could look after the kids for you. Yeah, um, I don't think that Ellen, or the State of New York, would be comfortable with you watching her children. What are you saying, Grace? Are you implying thatI'm irresponsible? Are you implying that you've never heard that before? I raised two step-children on my own. Karen, you havea staff of over 30. Including one who looks exactly like you in case one of the kids wants a hug from "Mom" in the middle of the night. Honey, that's not fair. I loved those kids. And so did Karen II! Why are you getting so upset? Maybe because you're accusing me of being a bad mother, and saying that I can't be trusted around children. Children of people that we barely like I might add. I'm leaving and taking my juice boxes with me. And this sippy cup. So this placeisn't gay after all. Well, it makes sense. On the way in, we didn't see a single antique store, pilates studio, or a man who weighed less than 280 pounds. Or a billboard warning against sexually transmitted diseases. Who is it? It's townspeople. It looks like the cast of "Rosanne." (ÇÏÃþ¹ÎÀ» ´Ù·é ½ÃÆ®ÄÞ) Well guess youbetter let 'em in. Hello. You the guyswho bought the place? - Uh, yes, but we're not planning on-- - But you're gay, right? No. Actuallymy father and I.. we're just about to go trolling around town for smart, attractive ladies. Hellooo! You sure you're not gay? And before you answer, we've been to San Francisco. Well, we haven't. And I certainly have not marched nude in their gay pride parade. Twice. So you're not gay? Aw, crapI got my hopes up for nothing - Wait, you--you want us to be gay? - Well, sure. When the gays come, the property values shoot up. And they fill the place with cute restaurants and adorable shops. Well, I never thoughtI'd say this, but, um, good news, small town families! We are gay! I knew it! I knew it! Oh, man, we are gonna make you feel so welcome here. Hey, there's real good chanceour son Jason's gay - Dad, I'm not gay. - Hey, you wanna go to college? You're gay. And Native American Well, I hate to break it to you, plain folk, but, um, we're not staying. Yeah, we really-- we thought we were buying a house in the other Middleborough. But my friend here, well, he's made of straw. Well, this sucks! So you're telling me there's nothing we can say to make you change your mind? Sorry. Okay, but some people might not take kindly to gays moving out of the neighborhood. Well, Are you threatening us? Let's just sayyou've been warned. Will, I'm frightened. I've never feltso welcome in my life. Relax, Jack, I mean, really, what's gonna happen? Oh, my God! Somebody threw a brick through our window. No They threw a loafof banana bread. And there's a note: "Gays, don't go home. - P.S. Enjoy the jam." - What jam? Jack, now's our chanceIt's 8:05. Everyone here is straight, so they're obviously watching "Cold Case." Let's sneak out to the car. God, I'm so nervous. In the last ten minutes I've used the half bath three times. Jack, these people mean business. Four teenagers drove by and egged our house. Well, they left a quicheon the front porch. Hurry up, Jack. Before the high school band marches by again playing "We Are Family." (°ÔÀÌ ÇÁ óÀÌµå ÁÖÁ¦°î) Damn. The one time I leave the house without my giant papier mach?head. There they are!Let's go! Oh, my GodWhere are the keys? - I thought you had them! - I thought you had them. Quick, Bobgrab the tiramisu! Oh, my God, retreat!Retreat! Hey, Karen. - I'm glad you're here. - Well, I suppose you'vecome to apologize Okay, um There was a situation that happened between us. And as a result of that situation, you were upset. For that, I'm sorry. Okay. You know what I'm not hearing? An actual apology and a decent Rolling Stones song since 1973. Look, Karen, I'm sorry, but taking care of children is a huge responsibility. It's more "Tickle Me Elmo" and less "Let's fill Elmo up with drugs and smuggle him across the border." - Hi, guys. - Oh, Ellen, hi! What are you doing here? Hey, I wantedto bring you this. It's little Roman's DVD, Barney and Friends at the Park. Oh, okay, I just gotta make sure I don't mix this up with Will's DVD, Bernieand Friends at the Gym Yeah. Just have Will put it in after Roman wakes from his nap. Well, Will's out of town, but I'll remember. - Oh, uh, Will's not gonna be there? - No. Oh. Is that a problem? You know what I just realized? Rob's sister can probably do it. She lives closer to us anyway. Judy? The one who has to turn the lights on 14 times or the oceans will dry up? Ellen, why would you leave your kids with someone who has such an important job? Ellen, what's going on? Um, well, I assumed that you and Will would be watching them together. And uh.. - well - Well what? You don't think I'm responsible enough to take care of your children on my own? Oh-ho. This is so delicious, it's got to be fattening. Rob's sister willjust be easier Oh. Okay, um if you don't want me watching your kids then I guess there's really nothing else to say. Excuse me Wow. - Heh. Well, I guess I better go. - Hey, hey, Ellen. You shouldbe ashamed of yourself And not just because you're dressed like an audience member from 'The Price is Right' Uh, excuse methis is Ann Taylor LOFT Yeah, and I'll bet when you walked down the street they all loft. - You know what? I'm leaving. - No, you're not. Listen, you're wrong about Grace. She's one ofthe kindest, most caring and most responsible people that I have ever met. She spent hours transforming her crappy apartment into an even crappier one so that your kids could have a good time. And she was so worried about their health, she wouldn't even let them have any juice! Your kids would be lucky to spend time with someone like Grace. She's got a heartas big as her nose If you can't see that, then.. you should get your eyes fixed instead of that freak show under your shirt. What are theydoing out there? I can't be sure, but I think it's the second act of Pippin. Why aren't you peoplewatching "Cold Case"?! - Come on, Jack, let's try the back door. - Will Truman! Coming on to meat a time like this! Oh, for God's sake, come on! They're forcing their way in and they've got torches! Actually, they'rescented candles. They make wonderful accents. There's my college boy. Look, we're--we're not the kind of gays you want. We're not pioneers, we're we're lazy gays. The lazy, hazycrazy gays of summer. We wanna move someplace where somebody else has already done the work. Our kind of gay couldn't survive here. You need heartier stock. We can't wait for pioneer gays! It took us - No, you're stayin'! - You don't need us. You can fix up this town and make it fabulous all on your own! You just need a few design accents. Look, it's easy! Look at how I upgraded the bathroom in just half an hour. Come here. I found hand towels that matched the tile. I put out a bowl of potpourri. And I smooth-coated the stucco to create a kind of Moroccan-- Let's get the hellout of here! But I wantedto see the bathroom! Ah, Smitty. I'm feeling a little down. A friend told me that she didn'tthink I would be a good mother Well, my own mother was shot dead in front of me by her boyfriendwhen I was twelve And I've been haunted ever since, wondering if I could have saved her.

I just told hereverything that I believe Well, not everything. I didn't tell her that I think that Robin Williams shinesin dramatic roles Oh, thank goodness. I never would've seen those kids again. Look, I am so sorry for what I said about you, I was wrong. You would be greatwith those kids I don't know, honey. I think maybe you were right. No. Granted, you're not what I would call a traditional mom. But when the chips are down, you come through. Even though you were angry with me, you still stood up for me.

                    			Ew. Since when did they start making orange-flavored Cheerios? Since you poured your juice in the bowl Hey. Our Alumni newsletter came today It's always fun to see what people've been up to Oh, hey, Will Look at this picture of Amy Scott on the Great Wall of China That's two things you can see from space Yes, she's big-boned Yes, it looks like this two-thousand year old wall is crumbling beneath her But, do we really have to insult everyone whenever this thing comes out? Hey, if I'm donating 10 bucks to the school, I'm gettin' something for it I just think that kind of pettiness is a waste of energy Why measure ourselves against other people's successes and failures? That's crazy! How else are we gonna figure out if we're better than someone? Jack, just let it go, or else he'll start going on about his new therapist Anyways, that's what my new therapist says You know that New York Magazine named her one of the Top 75 therapists in the city? And if you don't count Jews, Top 2 She wrote this book on seasonal affective disorder. It's amazing Yeah. I've been meaning to read that Maybe in the summer when each day isn't like looking into a black abyss Call me old-fashioned, but I think therapy is a load of hooey Give me six carefully placed leeches anyday You know, Grace, you should try Dr. Keller She is tough, but good Here's her card I'm the one that wrote "tough, but good" Why not. Maybe there will be a real loser in the waiting room who will make me feel better about myself What time's your appointment? I just had the most horrible experience This dwarf tried to steal my purse Fortunately, I was able to wrestle him to the ground and get it back Karen! This isn't your purse! It's a Dora The Explorer lunch box! You just mugged a little girl A hungry, frightened little girl Are you saying I don't know a dwarf mugger in a plaid skirt and braids when she skips past me?! I don't know, Karen This is strikingly similar to last week when you thought that woman stole your fur and you came home with a seeing-eye-dog around your neck Yeah, and that fur crapped all over my carpet, too! Well, just in case, we need to go back to the school and make sure nobody's missing a lunch box What? It's egg salad What kid wants that?

This might have something to do with my brothers Scoot over a little bit, you're blocking the clock Oh, sorry I just remembered this thing that happened in a touch football game It was Thanksgiving I think I was about 12 Interesting. Would you like to share that? - I would - Well, you can't 'Cause you crapped around for about So we'll get into that next week In the meantime, I'd like to give you an assignment An assignment? Are you using your mind tricks to mold me into an assassin? What's my code name? How about Grown Men Acting Cutesy Makes Me Wanna Throw Up? I was hoping for double-O something. But Okay, I'd like you to write a letter to your younger self apologizing for what you've become And warning him not to make the same mistakes - How long does it have to be? - I'm guessing it's gonna be quite long Should--should it be typed or handwritten? I don't care I'm not gonna read it Thank you, Dr. Keller - How'd it go? - Whew. Intense. Grueling Like I've never felt so raw, emotionally - Did you cry? - No, no I did last week and she made fun of me - That is awful! - No, no, I deserved it 'Cause I'm not a baby, I'm a man I don't want to go in there You may not know this about me, but I really hate talking about myself Well, it's courageous the way you force yourself Grace? It's only 50 minutes and I'll be right out here doing my homework Ugh! There's homework? I'll just copy yours Karen, are you in here? Ollie, Ollie, OxyContin Rosie!

Eh, I'm not that invested Well, I'm gonna get her to admit it Why does the weight of the world always fall on my shoulders? Good thing I did my shrugs today Rosie, this place is spotless Whatever you've been doing, why don't you do it to the tops of your hands? Great. I've been cleaning all morning Oh, Rosie. As a reward for all of your hard work I made you a nice big turkey sandwich It's hanging from a string off the balcony If you can get it, it's yours. Go on Great. I put a tarantula in the liquor cabinet If you can find it, it's yours Jackie, you're here just in time to help me feed my fish Fish tanks People say they're relaxing, but I've never really found them to be Hey Oh, sorry! Hey, Kare, can I ask you something? / Sure Well, you know how I assert my individuality by wearing a gently satirical button every day? Of course! Who could forget your "God is coming and she is pissed button"? God is a woman It's funny 'cause it's blasphemous - So, do you like this one? - Oh, yes, honey, I love it - You didn't even read it - I did too Then what's it say? Honey, I don't need to tell you We both know what it says Yeah, but I want you to read it Why don't I read it later, honey? You know I always like to curl up in bed with a good button Read it ! / No Read it ! / No Read it ! / No Read it ! "A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle"? No! I only wear that during Women's History Month This one says, "A man's gotta believe in something I believe I'll have another beer." Eh, the ladies like it Jackie, why are you acting so crazy? Because you're blind as a bat, Karen You need glasses! My vision is perfect. How dare you! Okay.

We passed, like, If I'm not interesting, then why am I gonna be a case study in her next book? - What are you even a case study for? - Who cares? I'm in a book Grace A. Adorable New York Neurotic Well, I think this is a bad idea Well, you're just saying that because you're not interesting enough to be a case study Will T. Bitter New York Homo - I'm interesting - You're not in a book Oh, who cares? How embarrassing I feel sorry for you, selling yourself out for a little attention. So sad It's killing you, isn't it? I'm gonna get in that book, or this city is gonna burn See, Karen, that exam wasn't as bad as you thought And it was quick too 'Cause your pupils are already dilated I guess so, but, you know, that doctor wasn't as thorough as I had expected He almost forgot to do my breast examination With the rising cost of insurance these days doctors don't touch you inappropriately unless you demand it Oh, Jackie, you're a good friend Thank you for making me come here Even if I did have to be in the same room with of all these hideous freaks Oh, she didn't mean all of you, no no. But, I mean, if I, like, had to guess, probably, you know, like you and you Excuse me, sir, can you turn around? Yes, definitely you, heh Well, your glasses are ready, Mrs. Walker And I'm sorry I had to put in so many eye drops but your eyes had absolutely no moisture in them I actually had to blow dust off them Rosie uses Pledge on a paper towel while I sleep Well, why don't you try these on and see if they fit because I really don't care to spend any more time with you I can see!

You know they've had glasses since the 16th century Yeah, um, she didn't like wearing them then either Hi, is this the Alumni Association? This is Grace Adler. I just wanted to give you a heads-up. I'm gonna be in a book It doesn't matter what kind of book Just please put in, "Grace Adler will be starring in a book." - Hey - Hi. How was your session? Oh, it was good. Yeah - Yeah, Georgia and I had a great time - You mean Dr. Keller No, no, Georgia Guess who's in the book? What? How did you get in the book? Well, I just dug deep. Like I talked about the real issues of my life my fears, my childhood, my last relationship. And then just to nail it, I-- When I talked about my mother, I-I developed a facial tick This is so unfair! The book is my thing! I had it first - Yeah, well, she was my therapist first - You didn't even read her last book Well, I'll read this one 'Cause I'm in it Well, if you're gonna be in it I don't wanna be in it - Good, don't be in it - You don't be in it! She's obviously more interested in me - Oh, really? Do you fake mental illness? - I don't have to! This crazy is all real! You know what? I'm going to Georgia and I'm gonna tell her I will not stand for this What's she gonna to do? Kick me out of the book? / Maybe I'm going with you! Oh, Karen. Gosh, I felt so bad the way we left things I rushed right over after seeing Vin Diesel in The Pacifier I'm not gonna lie to you, Jackie I am flattered that you raced to my side But I still can't forgive you for making me try those devil goggles on But why? Karen a lot of people wear glasses Charles Nelson Reilly Larry King Jessica Tandy You know, right up near the end there Honey, that's my point I'm getting old You know, when I saw myself in that mirror today all I could think was, I should be wearing a boa and Wayland Flowers should have his hand up my ass Well, there's nothing you can do about it now Karen, all straight people age Honey, sometimes I wish I was one of the little fishies They never get old They never die They just swim around and around in that tank for six months and then miraculously turn into a completely different kind of fish Karen, I'm not gonna have this argument with you again. You will never be a fish! Isn't it enough you drink like one? No! Now leave me alone, you vague, formless shape! All right, fine. But you should know, there's no shame in getting old There's only shame in getting ugly But that's never gonna happen to you All right? So here I'm gonna leave these here and you put them on when you're ready to join the real world And I mean "The Real World: Hawaii" with the funny drunk girl Not "The Real World: Seattle", where the girl with the Lyme Disease got slapped You look stunning in those glasses, lady I do? You really think so, Rosie? I do. You look like the lovely and talented Tina Fey Wow. Well, if there's a compliment higher than that, I don't know what it is You know what else, my sweet, sweet Rosie? What, Mommy? Now that I have these glasses on I can see the layer of filth that's covering every surface in this bathroom,including you! So get your two friends, chamois and 409, and get to work! Enjoy those glasses, lady, because they're gonna be blended in your margarita tonight No salt on the rim I'm sure sooner or later, somebody's gonna do a case study about handsome gay men and the women that bug the hell out of them Well, you're already in a book It's called, People Who Push Their Way Into Other People's Books 'Cause They're Too Lame To Get Their Own Book Yeah, I'm sure that's the working title Hey, what's going on out here? I'm in session Look, here's the deal. Only one of us can be in your book & I really think it should be me And I think it should be me I am way crazier than him I almost cut all my hair off today Oh, please, she would never cut off her hair It's half her personality Reminds me of my mother Fake! That's fake! Enough. Come on in I thought you were in session I lied, I was having a scotch and a cigarette before my next client Do you mind if I bum a smoke? - You don't smoke - Yes, I do I have an oral fixation because I was not breast-fed enough as a child I have the same thing I got it from my mother That's my twitch She stole my twitch! I steal too. I'm really messed up Look, do you two really think that this fight is just about being in the book? - Oh, you mean what's underneath the book? - Ugh, here we go Please, we went over it a million times Our codependent relationship is toxic & will never grow until we spend more time apart By clinging to each other, we're not emotionally available to anyone else - blah, blah, dysfunction-- - Blah, blah, blah, psychologically crippled We've been over it so many times We've got it on coasters Sorry, dumb asses This is just about being in the book Your relationship is fine - It is? - We're not toxic? Ugh. I'm gonna tell you what I told Mary-Kate and Ashley O Together, you two pretty much balance each other out Apart, you're just a couple of skinny little bag ladies with big sunglasses Did you hear that? Our relationship is perfectly healthy More importantly, she said we were skinny like the O. twins ÀÚ¸· Á¦ÀÛ - ³×ÀÌÆ® µå ó¸  24 ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Á °ÇºÎ ¹èÆ÷ / ¼öÁ¤ ±ÝÁö ¹èÆ÷½Ã ÀÚ¸· ÃâÃ³¸¦ ²À ¹àÇô ÁÖ¼¼¿ä

I was taking the girls out for a run in their jogging bra And guess who happened by? Say, Burt, some of my wife's hair coloring came out on the sofa You wanna take a look? Sure, but I might have to get some industrial solvent I hate when your father does that This is Burt's one day off! What can you possibly see in Mr. Wolfe? He's creepy and weird Honey, how can you say that? And after all the lovely things that he's said about you while he was watching you through binoculars from his home office Aw, he did? So, honey, how's everything going with your dad? Has he stopped seeing you as a big joke? 'Cause when you figure out how he does it, tell me No, I haven't. I try to change things I asked him if he wanted to spend the day with me but, uh, he'd rather play golf Well, honey, you should go with him That's where he feels comfortable And men let their guard down when they feel comfortable Huh? Take Burt for instance Just this morning, he told me the combination to his safe As we lay on the fold-out watching you get dressed Aw This is where Charlie Heinz missed the putt lost the whole club championship We all thought he choked Turns out he had a mini-stroke Now he can only say the word "chair" You know, I don't think I ever told you I did a redesign on a country club in West Chester New York Magazine, actually, they did a piece on it Yeah. I remember-- I remember when you had a lemonade stand and you spilled lemonade all over the place Heh-heh Yeah, similar story Oh, yeah, and this is where Arnie Regal-- lost complete use of his right side Hey, where'd you go? Ah. You missed a great wrap party at White Castle last night Whoo, it was off the hook! Jamie let us get one big thing, and one little thing Well, I'm glad everybody had a good time Uh-oh. Are you mad? You're mad, your mood mole is getting darker Well, it should be a light blue, because I'm fine Although, if it ever turns a light blue, it's probably time for a biopsy All right, well, I can't believe I was worried you were gonna get upset Oh, why would I be? It was funny My blind date was actually blind - I did not see that coming - Ha ha! You looked pretty foolish! I felt pretty foolish Now I just need you to sign this release so we can air the episode Yeah, I don't think so Well, if you don't sign it, we can't put it on Yeah, I get that You are ruining me! So, we're on the fourth hole, I tell her just relax and swing through This one, dammed if she doesn't take her shirt off Well, you said "tee off" - Are you sure you're all right? - Dad, what do you think? I flew out of the cart, and all you did was laugh about it Now, be reasonable The only reason I laughed, was because it was very, very funny Grace, what happened? You know the water hazard off the eighth fairway? Well, I've driven many a ball into it, but never a daughter You didn't happen to see a Titleist 4 down there, did you? Titlest 4. I don't know what that is You know the beauty of it is, if I hadn't sliced, I would've knocked her right into the green! Dad, stop it! Sweetheart, it's just a joke I'm not a joke. I'm your daughter But the only time you ever show any interest in me at all is when something embarrassing happens that you could spin into some sort of funny joke to tell your friends - Oh, sweetheart-- - Dad, no No, I'm going Happy birthday, Dad Here's your ball Hi. I, um I felt bad about the way we left things, so I bought you a potted plant Where is it? I did not buy you a potted plant Here's the thing I just got back from Out TV and I'm in real trouble unless you agree to be on the show Look, I wish I could help you But I can't You--your stupid trick really hurt me, Jack Because it spoke to all of my insecurities about my looks What?! Don't you get it? The only reason that was funny is because everyone thinks you're handsome Even you? / Come on, Will, you know how I feel about you So will you sign the release? No. And, no, I do know how you feel about me You're always talking about my thinning hair or my spreading thighs When have I ever done that? You changed my name on the mailbox downstairs to Baldy McLegdough! Will, I only do that because I'm the one who's insecure about my looks Now, please, will you help me out? No! What do you think-- You're just saying that so I'll sign your stupid release No, I'm not Look, I know that to you and the rest of the world I come off as beautiful Almost godlike Okay But trust me. It's just an act For instance, it pains me to show you this but I'm ashamed of my ankles The hair has rubbed off in this area because of sock chafing Ankle hair? You make me humiliate myself in front of the entire restaurant and you give me ankle hair? If you want me to sign this release you're gonna have to do a lot better than that All right! I'm gonna show you something But you have to promise it stays in this room forever. You promise? Oh, my God Is that a girdle? No. It is a man-girdle I got it in the man's section at Victoria's Secret Why would you wear something like that? You don't know the pressure to be thin at a gay network, Will There's a purging station in every bathroom Now, will you sign it? After that, how could I not? Jack, there is one thing I should tell you What's that? Jack McFarland, you have been Pink'd! What? Oh, my God! Will? Genius. Even better than you at the restaurant Damn you, Will Truman! Well, I will not sign the release. A-ha! All right, if you won't sign the release will you sign this waiver for unlimited use in perpetuity around the universe?

Clearly you don't understand Shakespeare Now, Ophelia may be insane and suicidal but first and foremost she's a pretty girl You're in a sea of troubles Why aren't you wearing a bikini? How can I drum this into your heads? Acting is not about emotion! It's about two things Making pleasant faces and moving to the right spot That is the very essence of the McFarland Method Acting is attracting That's my catch phrase Well, that and ma ma se, ma ma sa ma ma coo sa Honey, my catch phrase is you figure it out All right, actors let's take five That'll give you a chance to purchase my McFarland method books, DVDs, mouse pads I only have large men's t-shirts, and girls I'm afraid I'm out of the baby tee's Honey, I had baby tee's Then I put plant food on 'em and now look Excuse me, Sir could you please sign my book?

Thank you Justall the way And then one day, you didn't show up So I took over Oh, and then one day I showed up so you can leave I'm confused Who's teaching the class now? Now you see what you've done? You've broken the cardinal rule of acting You've confused the hot guy I thought the cardinal rule of acting was when I see you with your wife I act like we're not sleeping together You've used my method to have sex with women? Shame! I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave This is my class now And there's nothing you can do about it That's where you're wrong, Schacter Do you really think that Jack McFarland would be stupid enough not to trademark his McFarland Method? Because if you think that, you're right I am that stupid Karen, let's go! Let's start with the money So, who do you wanna leave it to? I suppose you wanna leave a substantial amount to charity No Of course, I'd like you to get some Thank you I'm very touched How much would you like to leave me? Gosh, I don't know How much did you leave me? I'm not really comfortable disclosing that Just leave what's in your heart You know, the heart you're apparently keeping along with all your other organs even though they could save a life I don't want some stranger peeing with my kidney Come on, Will. Tell me We tell each other everything No, a will is a very personal thing Nobody's seen it Except for my mother But that's only 'cause I asked her to proof it God, can you imagine the embarrassment of having a will with typos? I'd die! Again Your mother knows? Come on, tell me! No. Stop Leave it alone Come on Let's get on with this I got an insane amount of work to do today Is that the sandwich cart? Egg salad! I called it, egg salad! Connie, it's Will Can you get Will's mom on the phone? Make yourself comfortable, Grace I'll be there in a minute Please don't sit down until I get there Oh, Grace, have you seen that new show "Desperate Housewives"? My friends and I play this drinking game when we watch it Yeah, one shot every five minutes Oh, look at that You don't even need a TV Yeah, and sometimes I don't even have a friend over So what brings you to this neck of the woods? I've been thinking about death Do you ever think about death? I was forced to this summer when our sweet little Biscuit died Oh, I heard he was a wonderful dog He was a character, that one He was just 25 pounds full of love Unless you weren't white, then watch out I don't know I guess I must be thinking about it 'cause I'm doing my will now Now I know why you're here You want me to proof it? Yeah, okay, I'll get my red pen and my half glasses No. No That's not why I'm here This is a little awkward, but I would like to leave Will some money And I don't want him to be embarrassed if I leave him more than he left me So how much did he leave me? What's your game, Grace Adler? Nothing I'm just curious I would never betray my son's confidence He told me he was gay years ago I still haven't told anyone Marilyn, I understand We can still chat about other things though, can't we? I suppose - More wine? - Yeah - thank you - You're welcome honey, are you still mad about that acting class? Why do you care anyway? You're a big executive at Out TV now You got a briefcase, an office big-boy underpants I guess because it's my class And I should be the only one allowed to teach it Well, honey then go and get it If you want something that much you shouldn't let anything stand in your way Dammit, you're right! How do I get it, though? Because he won't give it up He's clinging to it like he's Kirstie Alley and the class is a shred of dignity Well, honey, you've got to give him something that he wants more than that class A balloon ride over Taye Diggs' house? No, honey something he wants I mean, the reason that people become acting teachers is that they're failed actors I mean, look at you.ta Hagen I mean, all the teachers would give it up in a minute if they got the right part But I can't get him to be an actor again Honey, I have connections I can get him a part Fantastic! But wait If you had connections why have you never gotten me a part? Honey, I said I had connections not superpowers So I've decided on a number for the amount of money I wanna leave you Oh, great, let me just fill in the. $1400 And if you go first it'll be the same How did you.Wait Lavender perfume masking the scent of an afternoon spritzer The way you're standing up straight as if somebody told you to stop slouching You've been to see my mother! Will, I don't--I don't get it You're--you're rich And I don't mean in that stupid "It's a Wonderful Life" kinda way where you have a lot of friends You have money This is not about my money, Grace This is a breach of trust I can't believe that you went to my mother God, I can't even talk to you right now! This never would have happened if you had just told me in the first place All right, actors, take your seats We have a lot of work today Elaine, are you gaining weight? I'm pregnant Well, congratulations You just went from leading lady to funny friend Uh, excuse me Mr. Dennehy I am not Brian Dennehy Oh Right, and I'm not Betty Boop Hey, what if I were to tell you that you are going to walk out of here right now and never teach this class again? I don't think so There's nothing that would make me leave my students Even if I were able to get you the acting job of your dreams? King Lear on Broadway? Close! Banging on a garbage can lid in the road company of Stomp Well, I hardly think that. Oh, I could get used to this Goodbye, class Where's he going? Does that mean I shouldn't go to the Radisson after class? Students, I have good news Allow me to introduce the creator of the McFarland Method, Mr. Jack McFarland I know! Yes, it's me! And from now on this class will be run the McFarland way Gentlemen, up front Ladies, take the broken chairs Will, don't turn this around You're the one that did something hurtful to me You want more money, Grace fine, you can have more money There's 300 bucks in the back of my-- Sock drawer Now it's 20 and a frozen yogurt punch card How could you do that? How could you leave me such a measly amount of money? Is that how little I mean to you? - Of course not - Then, why? You wanna know? You really wanna know? Yes Because 15 years ago when I wrote that will, that's all the money I had Wait, you haven't updated your will in 15 years? Will, you update your Barry Manilow fan site, web thing every day I'm telling you, Grace it's called the "Manilow-down." And people depend on it I tried to rewrite that will so many times Every time I sit down to make a list of everything I have I just feel like I have nothing Will, you've got everything You've got your health, friends, family You just made partner And most importantly of all you still have all your hair It's just, the guy I am now is not the guy I was hoping to be when I wrote that will in law school - Oh, come on. - No, I'm serious I never thought I'd be just another corporate lawyer with a lot of stuff I wanted to accomplish more Will, you are young Whatever it is you want to accomplish in your life there is still plenty of time to do it - You think? - I know Come on Accomplish us a couple of hot dogs You okay, honey? No, I'm not. I thought I wanted to teach this class But now that I have it again it feels like a step backwards Maybe you're just moving on You're showing growth Oh, sorry You know, I don't miss teaching I guess I just miss people looking at me I miss being the center of attention Is that wrong? No, honey, that's just who you are And you'll find something You can't help but shine Oh, Karen But how am I gonna tell all my students I'm abandoning them again? Don't. Just cash their checks and then never come back That's a good idea There isn't hope of any one of them ever having an actual career anyway we're still here And scene Hey In honor of us not getting hit by that bus I thought that I would treat us to lunch Wow, you are happy to be alive Just so you know I have finished both of our wills Really?

Well, since it's my premier, I wanted to go with a really, really big celebrity So I went with the blonde guy who sat at the front desk for seven years on "NYPD Blue" The homo that replaced Gail O'Grady? How on earth did you get him? Oh, well, he was just delivering this desk, and I said, "Hey, what are you doing later?" That is genius - Good work, Jack.

Um, isn't it a little late to change anything? I mean, people are so used to seeing my face on promotional seat cushions I don't know if anyone wants to sit on Karen's face Jack, if I'm right about this, this entire city's gonna wanna sit on both your faces So, I am seeing the lobby floors in Terrazzo (´ë¸®¼®À» °ñÀç·Î ÇÑ ÄÜÅ©¸®Æ®) It's beautiful, durable, and chic, without being trendy - I love it.

Hello, Malcolm? - Hi, Will - Aah! Hey, you scared me I guess we all feel a little jumpy and unsafe with Martha Stewart's release I was just admiring the photograph - Is that your family? - No, it came with the frame - But you're in the picture - Yeah, I used to be a model So how's work going, Will? It feels good to help people, huh? Yeah, about that Um It seems all I'm doing is transferring money from the Cayman Islands to Russia And the Russian kids could not be more grateful And the Cayman kids don't need the money because they have the beach and whatnot Yeah, I-- I've been to the Cayman Islands and, uh, people down there mostly just work in hotels or braid hair for a dollar So what--where is the money coming from? Well, the Americans come and they leave tips And then they send the money to the Russians. The, uh, Caymanites I don't believe that Okay, what's this really about? This! Or is it really about the fact that the gang went out for drinks last night and nobody called you? What gang?! I still haven't met anyone else! Except Roscoe, who apparently thinks I keep Alpo in my pants! Somebody's got the new job blues Look, something weird is going on here and I wanna know what it is Nothing--there's nothing weird going on here Malcolm, the package has arrived Will, could you excuse me for a moment? I have to talk to, uh Hank from accounting I apologize for that Hank wants to go home early to pick up his kids from soccer practice So where were we? I believe you were asking me some kind of a question No, no, just, um wanted to say hi - Stop! - What? If the gang goes to Tony Roma's tonight you want me to call you? No, I'm good, I'm good Oh, hey, Karen - Thank God. I really need to talk to you - Forget it, honey I know when I'm not wanted I just came by to pick up one last thing I'm not even gonna tell you what this was for But, Karen, I want you to be my co-host - You do? - Yeah. You know, I thought about it and you were right. I was a selfish jerk and I'm sorry Do you really mean it, Jackie? I kinda do, yeah Show time. Let's go We got over 10 people out there just waiting to earn their Burger Barn coupon Tall gay guy I'm not going out there Honey, Jackie doesn't need a co-host He's been laughing at his own jokes for years Karen, but I really want to share this with you Oh, honey, no This is your thing If we do everything together then what are we? Will and Grace And that's just sad Okay. So this girl is outta here! Girl? Then you're definitely out I just assumed you were a drag queen Ladies and gentlemen the host of Jack Talk, Jack McFarland! Oh, honey, go out there and knock 'em dead! Okay. Thanks, Kare And I promise I'm gonna start every show with a little signal just for you I'd like that - Should we go help him? - No, no, no, no That was for me Mrs. Newsom, good news My schedule has freed up so I can do that job for you Yes-- Yeah, it would have been nice to work on that hotel. But I am-- I'm equally passionate about, um converting your terrace into an eco-friendly ferret village Yes. Bye Hi I brought you some hot chocolate 'cause I remember that was your favorite I'm just kind of wishing it wasn't 90 degrees outside What are you doing here? I want to know why you quit - You know why - No, I really don't Tom You never should have called me It was a mistake from the very beginning You have feelings for me And you don't have them for me? It doesn't matter. That's not the point. The point is.. that I should not be having this conversation with someone who's married But what--what if I-- I can't help the way I feel, Grace - What is that? Don't do that - It's the truth - Nono - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I-- I shouldn't have come here. II-- - Let's just forget it even happened - I didn't mean to-- I didn't mean to-- - I know you didn't - It was awkward and-- I know it was and I'm sorry, but-- - So we're good? - Yeah Okay, then I'm gonna go Okay Malcolm - I need to talk to you - Sure You wanna go somewhere private? No, this is fine I can't work here anymore. I don't know what this is, but I'm not stupid Hank is not an accountant And I don't believe that he got stabbed in the neck while changing the toner! If you leave, Will, what will happen to the kids? The kids have $85 million in a Swiss bank account. The kids are fine! I knew this was going to happen. I said "Truman's a smart guy There's going to be questions" What is this all about? I mean, meeting me in the park, pretending you like my writing Hiring me for a job that doesn't even exist What the hell is going on? All right, I'm gonna be truthful with you We're not a charitable organization Uh doy! No need for harsh words I work for the government And we're protecting a very important individual who has requested your services - He wants your help - Who? - Open that door and find out - Why don't you just tell me?

I have huge news! I was here I didn't go anywhere, I have morals Look, you can't tell anyone what I'm about to tell you now Karen's dead husband is not dead What? Stan's alive? But there was a funeral We scattered a trash bag full of his ashes Apparently, that was just dirt and Rice Krispies Oh, my god, that's unbelievable! What happened? Remember Malcolm? The guy who recruited me for his foundation? It turns out he works for "big brother." - The TV show? - No, the government! He staged Stan's death because Stan was in some kind of trouble with the mob So, for the last two years, he and Stan have been living under seclusion under protection of "big brother." - The government? - No, the TV show Malcolm's sister-in-law is an associate producer or something Ok. Wait a minute, Your new boss actually works for the government and has been protecting Stan all this time? Yeah. He's not my boss anymore, I quit The whole thing is just complicated and convoluted It doesn't even make any sense It's like the contract they make you sign when you marry Tom Cruise Oh, God. Man God, Stan is back from the dead What did Karen say? I mean, she freaked when her stepdaughter came back from camp She doesn't know No one can know until they're certain it's safe for Stan to come out of hiding So, Grace we can keep secrets, right? Oh, yeah I mean, other people's secrets I don't have any secrets I'm a good person Hey, Will Where's Grace? How 'bout that Right in the blind spot Anyway, I'm sure you all heard about the horrible F-I-Asco at the premiere of "Jack Talk" last night Uh, no And in case you've forgotten we try not to give people reasons to call us "butt pirates." I tripped making my entrance knocked over the lights and caught the set on fire - And that's when you hurt your eye? - No When we were celebrating putting out the fire I got a piece of glitter in my cornea Grace, I called you last night Where were you? Did you get together with that Tom guy? Because it seems like you two were really hitting it off-- Stan's alive! Will saw him! It's true, Jack Last night I sat across from Stan and he talked to me same as I'm talking to you right now If I were eating 14 chalupas Wow I need some time to process that It may take a while because I only have one eye All I know is that I was here last night. That's all I know - Malcolm? - Hi.  Hi, gang I'm sorry to barge in here unannounced uninvited and reeking of hummus, but Will Can I speak with you privately, please? It's urgent Sure. Just let me get some pita to dip into your breath Why did you quit your job? Is it because I said you couldn't wear open-toed shoes to work? Uh, no, it's because I was working for a bogus charity which was a cover for a shady government operation to protect a back-from-the-dead former client And by the way some sandals can be very dressy I just hope you haven't been blabbing about Stan because anyone that knows anything can be a target for assassination What?! You never mentioned that! Well, que sera, sera What does that mean?! Whatever will be will be It's the very next line of the song I know what it means I was obsessed with Doris Day the same as any other normal teenaged boy Look, the important thing right now is to get these ice cream sandwiches into your freezer as soon as possible What are you doing with ice cream sandwiches? I'm gonna drop by without a gift? I think I was raised better than that No one can see us talking Quick, I'm your boyfriend! Hey, hey, hey Come on! Come on! Will, Will! Will, that is just disgusting and unnatural Oh, you're not Grace Never mind. Sorry Karen, what happened to you? you know how my big toe and the one next to it have always been webbed together? No. Although I always assumed you had a tail Yeah. Well, I finally had it surgically corrected I can't swim in really fast circles anymore, but I can wear flip-flops She removed the one thing that made her human Uh, excuse me, miss Malcolm Widmark I hope this isn't too forward but I find you quite beautiful I look forward to the day that I see you ride this thing toward me on a very bumpy road In a town where everyone's naked Karen Walker, and it is pleasure to meet a true gentleman Now, if you'll excuse me the gap between my toes is throbbing like a son of a bitch Sheer elegance What can I say, she is everything Stan said she would be much more - Your package is dripping - What can I say? I like her The ice cream sandwiches! Give me that So the doctor said he could separate my toes with a laser But I said, "Nope. Scissors." Hey, if it was good enough for my mother AnywhoThanks for not making me feel self-conscious Hey. Cyclops! What's with the idiot patch? (¿µÈ­ 'X-¸Ç'ÀÇ Ä³¸¯ÅÍ) I had the largest glitter-related tragedy since Mariah Carey's film debut Hello? Tom, I don't think I can go ahead with it Because it's wrong I said no, please just stop calling The American Heart Association They're relentless The boys are back Ms. Walker I have dated many women with physical and mental disabilities in my time but of the ones in chairs might I say you are the loveliest Speaking of chairs you look like a fun place to sit How would you like to go out on a date with me? Right now I can't see any reason why not You can't? Wanna to give it a minute? Well, let me just freshen up Come on, Rosie, Vamoose, moose I'm going on lunch, lady Mmm, Subway chicken parm Mmm,It could only taste better if I were eating this on your grave Sassy gals get the hose! You know, since my de-webbing I have so much more compassion for people in pain Ow! Look out, sissy! Malcolm - can speak to you privately? - Ow! You can't date Karen! You're still protecting her husband - It's a clear conflict of interest - Ooh, "conflict of interest." Somebody went to the University of Fancy Look, Will, don't worry It's all part of the plan We'll talk it over at the office tomorrow No, we won't We're gonna do my plan You don't date Karen You accept the fact that I quit And you never bring ice cream to a gay man's house, That's just hostile Jack you've had affairs with married men, right? I am insulted you would even ask Of course I have That's like me asking you if you rely too much on your hair Guilty It even got me out of my math requirement at N.Y.U. So you don't feel worried that cheating makes you a bad person? Why? What have I done? My only crime is being irresistible Besides, Grace, life is too short to waste time on over-thinking things When an opportunity comes I don't question it I grab it, drop its ring on the nightstand, and swing on it 'til dawn! You make it -- you make it sound so hot Necessary even Um, Yeah! And, um, it's also kind of sexy to have a secret no one knows Like when you drink too much and get a little tattoo that says "I love Will" What? Did you hear that? Karen's hurt - Karen, are you okay? - Ow! Did you hear that? Rosie's hurt! Tom, hi Let's do it Yeah. Life is too short and I just want to grab at it and swing on it 'til dawn! Oh, no, no, no, no that's just a little figure of speech I mean, we're going to run out of stuff way before dawn Yeah, I don't do that much - Okay - Okay It's official I don't trust Malcolm I don't trust Malcolm either - There, I said it - No, I just said it But, you didn't say "there, I said it." I agree with Jack Malcolm can't be trusted I said it before he--Look the important thing is we have to tell Karen the truth - That her husband is alive - We have to tell Karen Stan's alive - There, I said it - No, I said it - You're right, Grace - I said it before-- I'm the one making dramatic pronouncements here! About what, honey? Karen, you can't go out with Malcolm - Why not? - Because-- Because Stan's alive Now that is one hot cackle - Are you ready? - Oh, Malcolm. You will not believe what Will just said to keep us from dating He said that my dead husband Stan is alive! Oh, Will, you kill me And one day I'm going to have to repay the favor I did not see that coming Well, I saw half of it coming Will! Out in the hallway now! Hi, gang! Buddy, you made a big mistake telling Karen about Stan Thank God she thought you were joking If you pull that one more time, you are going to be majorly assassinated "Majorly assassinated"? Wicked assassinated? Oh, for God's sake This isn't about Stan anymore There's no danger You just want to sleep with Karen! Gosh, I just wanted to hold hands but do you think she'll go all the way? I know I've overstated the danger to you I want to keep Stan underground for a while longer to see if I have a future with his wife A future? You just met her! I've known her eight years and I just found out recently she has fish feet! Jack? Help me figure out what to bring Which one is sexier? Oh, Grace, I have no opinion on women's undergarments I don't know what pokes through where And where are you going? I'm going to meet Tom You know what? I'm not even going to think about it I'm going to close my eyes and do what I want Oh, hey, hello I'm George Bush, ha-ha Wait a minute Are you telling me you intend to know a married man in the biblical sense? And in the vagina? You can't do that Jack, we talked about this You said it was, it was fun, and sexy Not for you! You are a woman of quality That is such-- that's such a double standard What, you get to do it, but I don't? It's different for me, because-- because it-- I said-- All right. Listen, I'm going to tell you something that does not leave this room, okay? - I've never cheated - No! Yes I, too, am-- I, too, am a woman of quality Sure, I talk a big game, but deep down, I know it's wrong, and so do you! Let's face it, Grace You and I, we have always been the moral center of our group - We have? - Oh, come on You know how when Will and Karen get in their ridiculous shenanigans you and I always catch each other's eyes and shrug - We shrug? - Yes Because we're moral That is why we shrug And Grace, you were devastated when Leo cheated on you Do you really want to do that to someone else? The more you know And shooting star You know what, Jack? You're right. You're right You're right. You're right Tell me how you feel about this business then. I, I thought that I could be cavalier about love and sex but that's not who I am. And I'm glad it's not Thank you for being honest with me, Jack. Really Well If I'm really going to be honest, um There's something else I need to say to you I, um, do not have a G.R.I., glitter-related injury It's something much more hideous What happened to your eyebrow? Funny you should ask During the fire, I sing'd it off You mean "singed" No, actually, I mean sing'd As the set burned around me I refused to stop singing my patriotic finale You're a Grand Old Fag When I went to salute I didn't realize my sleeve was on fire Okay, look, we're done Will-- I didn't want to have to play this card, but if you keep it up I'm coming after your family That's the Partridge Family Would you be upset if they died? - Do not try to kiss me! - I wasn't going to Why? Was I bad? Wilma, Malcolm Inside, we need to talk! - We certainly do - Will, don't make trouble for me I just want to have dinner with Karen and catch a flight to D.C. by midnight I have to shred some documents for a client I can't say who, but I can't delay it Do you understand? Delay it It's Tom DeLay It's Tom DeLay's documents! You're an idiot! Well. Will said something that has made me very curious Well, I see you're curious too, Jack I just don't understand why Will would lie to me about Stan being alive I mean, come on, let's face it Will and I have always been the moral center of our group Stanley loved me He loved me too much to put me through the pain of the last two years for nothing So I know he's dead and I don't want anybody saying otherwise! - Miss Karen-- - Rosie, you stay out of this Miss Karen, Mr. Stan isn't dead I've been sending him updates on you for over a year He was in trouble, Karen He had to disappear And now the love of your life is back Wow Stan's alive Well Ain't that a kick in the pants Rosie thank you for finally telling me the truth You're fired I never want to see you again Malcolm, I'm ready for our date Stan may be alive but he's still dead to me!

And I finally got into the Harry Potter books You know I say I root for Gryffindor but secretly I love my Slytherin boys Àª Àª & Àª & ±× Àª & ±×·¹ Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º I Second That Emotion ½ÌÅ© Á¦ÀÛ ÇÑ±Û ¹ø¿ª ½ÌÅ© ÆíÁý ÃÖÁ¾ Å×½ºÆ® That was heartbreaking, Hurumi You are an extraordinary talent Arigato! Oh, and by the way somebody threw up on the radiator next to the toilet again It's pretty baked on but you can probably scrape most of it off with your bow Hey, Karen, I hope you don't mind I let myself in Although, considering this is a 17 bedroom mansion should you really leave the front door unlocked? Nah. What is there to take in here Well, it's not so much as what might get stolen as how many of your staff might try to escape Look I'm worried that you're not dealing with this whole Stan being alive thing I think you're in denial about your feelings Wait a minute You're using psychiatry on me I've read all the studies on psychiatry Have you? It's a pseudo-science and it doesn't exist And neither do postpartum depression or Brooke Shields karen You don't have to put up a wall with me I've seen you punching coat check girls swallowing buttons you thought were pills shooting at the birds in your wallpaper So come on talk to me - I don't know - Come on Start taking that wall down one brick at a time Come on just one brick - Just one? - Yeah. Come on I'll be right beside you Take that brick down Now, what do you see? Too quick My fault I shouldn't have pushed you that hard And please, swear to me you'll never tell me what was behind that brick Are you crying? Honey, I missed Stanley so much And know I find out that he's alive and that he lied to me It hurts, Will I feel empty and confused and even more alone than I did when thought he was dead Karen, c'mere C'mere You just let it all out That's it Now, you feel better? You take all the time you need I'm sorry, Jack I thought I'd have more time before the show No, Grace This is great! Thank you It just needed, you know a touch of elegance Oh, hello Life Saver! What?

Why would you swear we had him if we didn't have him? Because you said if we didn't have him I'd be fired Okay, I probably shouldn't have said that Just don't let it happen again, okay? Now. Do we have Angelina Jolie for tomorrow? If you say "no," you're fired She's super excited to meet you Great. Okay Now, what am I gonna do for a guest? We're on in five, four, three, two Welcome to "Jack Talk"! Today's guest interior designer Grace Adler!

Hey, Kathy Griffin, you're not the only funny red-head over 40! I think I'm gonna go Hey, here's a fun fact about Grace She lives with a gay man Oh, yeah Um, yeah I have for a while He's been my best friend for years Thank you! I'm also very involved in the New York gay scene That's right Grace has closed more gay bars than the Department of Health And, like my mother always says if you love gay men so much why don't you just marry one Believe me I've tried! Sounds like you love everything about gay men Not true Jack Talk audience can we speak seriously for just a moment? There is one thing I don't like I don't like gay men who don't like themselves I could listen to you talk forever I could But who wants to watch me make a protein shake? What did you do to me?! Uh, healed you? Do I look healed to you?! I took a few bricks out the whole damned building collapsed! I can't eat I can't sleep Yesterday, I was so upset I walked into the Mercer Hotel and threw a phone at the front desk clerk Karen, I'm sorry but if you want to get Get away from me! I want to be alone I haven't felt this emotionally raw and exposed since. Penthouse published those photos of me and Vanessa Williams Do you think Grace would mind if borrowed this? That's mine Hello? Grace, where are you? Why aren't you watching "Jack Talk?" I am!I'm getting my hair done but I've got channel Guys, when you hear what I said about gays I think you're gonna be pretty happy Maybe even free hot oil treatment happy All right Grace look, I gotta go I can hear myself through the phone on your TV, on Will's TV, in my head It's too much of a good thing Oh, here comes my serious moment Turn it up, Hector Can I speak seriously for just a moment? There is one thing I don't like I don't like gay men You know, it's kinda weird The way that episode was edited it almost makes it seem like Grace hates gay men Do you think she noticed? I'm sure it's fine I just hope you're okay with having only one testicle Simba looks angry I hate gays? Yeah, I know, Grace You said it on my show, remember? Do you have any idea what I have been through? On my way over here I was egged in the East Village Egg-whited in the West Village And in Chelsea some vicious queen threw a skinless chicken breast at me as he roller bladed by! I'm sorry, Grace The show ran crazy long I had to cut something if I wanted to keep my full four minutes of me making that shake Okay see that makes sense Now that I know the context Right / Yeah!

Why wasn't he on a leash? "Deal with things?" Who are you to talk about dealing with things? What do you mean? I deal Oh, please! You're zipped up tighter than Star Jones in a well, really anything with a zipper That's why you spend all of your time fixing everybody else's problems so you don't have to look at your own That's crap Really? Then why don't we take a few little bricks out of Will's wall, huh? Go ahead But you're not gonna find anything back there 'cause when something comes into my life, I tend to it. Then move on So you don't keep the remnants of your career back there? I quit my job to do something meaningful And how's that going for ya? It takes time to find the right thing Apparently, that applies to boyfriends, too because the only man that you've had a successful relationship with is Grace I've had tons of successful relationships! That all ended Successfully! Well, I'm glad you've got it all figured out, Will Because if I were you I'd be worried Oh, yeah?

You seem fine Why are you so drank when we together the same amount? Honey, you don't look so good Not so much fun peeking behind the wall, is it? No. People like us we should just leave the walls up and all the feelings on the other side What you say we start stacking those bricks back, huh? Good idea Me first Oh! The time that the football team caught me kissing that poster of the football team Never happened My eighth birthday which my mother celebrated by changing my name and moving us to Vancouver Good-bye or the time I told my first boyfriend I loved him and he said "Did you just eat falafel?" Doesn't hurt The horrible, muffled cries of Patty Hearst from behind that closet door Never happened Oh, what about.. what about Stan coming back? That's.that's a big ole brick I think I need to leave that one out for a while Really? Well, it hurts, but I may need to take a peek again I'll leave one out, too I had the perfect guy and the perfect job and I threw it all away Honey, I said leave out a brick not blow out an archway But, you know I do feel a little better Yeah? I'm glad I feel like I'm gonna throw up Okay Second door on your left Hurumi! Get your violin and spatula and meet Mr. Truman in the john! Love me back, dammit!

Oh, Karen, hi I didn't recognize you without Malcolm's tongue punching through the back of your head Well, Grace, since you like things that rhyme Although you are a lovely date please excuse me while I urinate You know, Grace, I do hope we're sitting in the smoking section because the sparks are flying between you and the D man Swimming fact, "Speedo" is French for "maximum package exposure" So, uh, where's my swimming instructor? Uh, I'll give you a hint He's the sexiest guy in the room Okay? And it's me, all right? Oh! See you later Wait a minute where are you going? I'm not letting you teach me how to swim! I'd sooner catch a ride home with Billy Joel! Will, I can teach you Just like I taught you how to trim around your nipples so your hair doesn't look like crazy eyelashes Yeah, after you put mascara on them! Did they or did they not pop? Come on, Will You said you wanted to learn Alright, I'll do it. But promise me you will not make me look stupid And jump and jump and down And jump and jump and down And jump and jump and down Now, that is a heck of a scallop Boy, it's so nice to be eating with a fork rather than jamming it into some guy's neck I'm kidding! I'm a government accountant Why would I kill that guy in Budapest? You know, I like having a couple friend Let's do this every Friday! It'll be our thing I'm sure that traffic school can get along without me Well, there's just two little problems with that Um, first, it's Tuesday And second, I would hardly call Dale and I couple Yeah, Grace hardly knows me Oh, that's because you're too modest If I were compiling a CIA file on Dale and I'm not the first page would read that Dale is a piano tuner with a nifty rent-controlled apartment in Staten Island And from a distance two blocks, naked he resembles a young Charles Bronson Um, Karen would you mind coming to the ladies' room with me? - Oh, honey, I don't really have to-- - You do now - Excuse us - Grace, what are you Hey, you're right Maybe I could make a little sissy How could you think that this guy is right for me? What's wrong with him? He's totally wrong for me Ok, Grace. I am gonna tell you something that I was saving for your eulogy You are a snob I am not a snob How could you say that? Every guy has a chance with me The unattractive, the unemployed the "lives with mom" Everyone welcome All right. Well, all I saw was a snob sitting there with a vinegar puss acting like nothing he said was good enough for her Honestly, Grace I thought you were better than that Girls? D-train here has a great idea Dinner tomorrow night at his place on Staten Island the Riviera of New York Harbor Did you know the Richmond Hill landfill is the highest elevation on the Eastern Seaboard?

Now, let go of the wall and lean back and I'll support you You sure you got me? Yes, I got one hand on your head and the other on your upper ass beard Okay. Wait, wait, where are you hands? I can't feel 'em! - They're right here - Put 'em back! Will, what is your problem?! Nothing, I'm fine. I just want.. I just want to go home And I think I swallowed a band-aid Will, you're being ridiculous! Where's my band-aid? Well, someone made a scene at the pool today I was upset No, I'm talking about me After you left, I jumped in the pool without looking and ended up riding Paul Sorvino for half a lap Are you okay? You left kinda fast I'm fine. I'm just.. I was just scared Well, you're gonna do better tomorrow I got us access to the kickboard shed Don't even ask me how I pulled that off Let's just say I had to pull something off Bathing suit Yeah, you know what? Actually, I, uh, I decided I don't wanna learn to swim What? Oh, don't answer that That might be the kickboard guy I gave him your number 'cause he sounded kinda dangerous but I didn't wanna be rude - It's Will - And Grace - You can call us "Wag" Get it? - Leave a message - I decided was cute - It's not Hi, Will, this is Adam from the pool Just wanted to confirm our lesson for 6:00 tomorrow Remember, no checks Wait a minute what was that? I thought you said you were done with swimming I know I just said that, but.. You said you didn't wanna take any more lessons Or you didn't wanna take them from me / Jack You don't trust me Look, you're my best friend and I love you But you're not exactly reliable I mean, I wanna learn from someone that I know is gonna be there to pull me out of the pool Not someone that puts diving rings around his neck and pretends he's a woman from Kenya But how could you think I would ever let anything bad happen to you? - Jack, I do trust you - Just not with the big things You know it's a real shame, Will Because you trusted me with the biggest thing in your life and I didn't let you down then What are you talking about? You were terrified to come out of the closet And who was the one who held your hand fixed your hair, and promised you everything was gonna be okay? - You - Yeah, that's right - Hey, Grace - Hey You're the first one here Oh, Karen and Malcolm aren't here? Did they call? Are they close? Yeah, any minute Oh, well, we're fine alone Did you hear a car door slam? Oh, oh, and..

What is wrong with you? You have not been this obsessed with a gray-haired man since you discovered Anderson Cooper! He is a lovely, old gay man And when I am his age and living alone in a crummy apartment with a 19-year-old cat who is either really sleepy or long dead I hope that someone will be kind to me Wait a minute. Wait a minute You think-- You think you're gonna be Clyde? - Is that what this is all about? - How do you know that I won't? I I saw this old photo of him on a beach It could have been me Except for the Korean War going on in the background Will. That's absurd You're not Clyde There is no way that you will ever age that well And there's another reason why you're not him - 'Cause I'll have you? - That's right And I ain't going anywhere So you got it? You will never be a lonely old gay man like Clyde Uh, excuse me I'm so sorry For everything I, I was wrong to assume that you're lonely Oh, I'm lonely. Heck, I leave my door unlocked in hopes of getting robbed But I'm not gay - You're not? / - No, I was married once to a beautiful doctor She, uh, travelled a lot to work, and when she had an affair with a colleague I-- I ended it I've been alone ever since Wow.

It's food and it's free - Oh, my God. He is me! I have great news, baby I talked with Stan I told him I thought that I was a better man for you than he is And he said, "Okay" He did? I promise you I'll never fake my death When I kill myself it's gonna be for real And I'm gonna take you with me That's so romantic - Is that true, Jackie? - He did I remember 'cause right after he said it we discovered an Asian man trapped underneath him So, you're okay now with me and mama?

I have something to say Oh, Stanley How could you? Wasn't it enough that you left me? Wasn't it enough that I was the last one to know that you weren't dead? But no. No. You have the gall to just let me go without even a fight You fleshy bastard You're ready to toss me aside like some meaningless fling, or unattractive baby How dare you Goodbye, Stanley After what you've done there is nothing you could say that would ever win me back Oh, Stanley Oh, Stanley!

                    			Hey, did you read the paper today? I stopped reading the paper Now, when people talk about the news I just shake my head and say "I know. It's unbelievable" Suddenly, I'm informed I know. I do the same thing with "I know, that was some game" Anyway, the Central Park Zoo has these two penguins that are apparently gay They're inseparable They show no interest in females during mating season Though they are interested in what females are wearing during Academy Award season That is so sweet Thank God there's something gay in this city I haven't dated So, did you hear the news? I know, it's unbelievable I've decided I'm going to move to a bigger place You're kidding When did you decide that? This morning The ratings for "Jack Talk" came in and we got a 17 rating and a 10 share Wow! Yeah, in this case, that means 17 watched and 10 of them were dressed as Cher I just figured now that I'm getting more successful I need to live in a place that feels successful Good for you, Jack. You should And you know what? I'll decorate it for free Oh, no, that's okay No, I want to I heard you Anyway. I've been saving my money in a Schwab account You've been investing? Oh, no, that's what I call my Q-Tip box I got five thousand bucks in it Five thousand? I'm so proud of you, Jack You're growing up Well, thank you So, I figured I spend it on an apartment or a whole lot of Jolly Ranchers Not the candy Well, you know what? It's Sunday Let's get the Village Voice and start looking Yeah, it'll be fun As a kid, I used to love going to open houses on Sunday afternoon Of course I was 12, so everything was out of my price range Grace, you wanna come? Oh, no, I'm going shopping with Karen I've gotta get my dress to wear on my annual holiday card Yeah When people send out those photos aren't they usually of a whole family? Yeah, like I'm gonna wait around for that Àª Àª & Àª & ±× Àª & ±×·¹ Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º ½Ì Å© Á¦ ÀÛ ÇÑ ±Û ¹ø ¿ª ½Ì Å© Æí Áý ÃÖÁ¾ Å×½ºÆ® Honey, how about this one? This is pretty It almost says, "it's not sad that I'm alone on this holiday card." I'm not going to be alone For fun, I'm going to Photoshop George Clooney in next to me And it just got sadder Especially for George Clooney Is there a rip cord for this shopping trip? Because I'm about ready to yank it Speaking of yankin' it where are the boys today? I thought they were coming with us Oh, Will's helping Jack look for apartments and then they're going to stop off to see some gay penguins Gay penguins. Please Honey, that is absurd There's no such thing as a gay penguin! Well, well, well Karen Walker and her Jewess out for a morning shop Well, if it isn't Tom and Helen Willis of TV's "The Jeffersons." Hello, Beverley Leslie How are things in Ankleville? Uh, not so good My dear wife Crystal has suddenly passed Oh, Beverley I'm so sorry Me, too. Although I never met Crystal But, oddly, I have met your business associate, Benji, 16 times Including once at The Ramrod I'm here to buy a dress to bury Crystal in Honey, I think maybe you should wear men's clothes for that Bev. Bev, honey come here You know that I love you in my way And I know that you loved Crystal in your way So now that she's out of the way is there anything that I can do for you? Well, Karen, it would mean a lot to me if you would attend Crystal's memorial service tomorrow afternoon Well, of course, Beverley I wouldn't miss it And Miss Adler why don't you join us Oh, no. No, I couldn't intrude on a day that's so intimate and personal and boring Oh, please! It's not going to be anything like that It's more like a party A celebration of her death - Life - Life So, I'll see you both tomorrow afternoon I'll be receiving from 5:30 'til 6:30 Boy, that's gotta be a long hour for you I didn't like any apartment we've seen so far Maybe we should call this realtor Eve Only She's like on every listing Oh, look. There it is Penguins Oh, look They're cute Which ones do you think are gay? Well, if I had to pick I'd say the two in the corner whispering and pointing at all the other penguins Hello. You guys are gay, right? He is, beat him up! No, I just want you to sign my petition Oh, yes, of course Thank you for watching "Jack Talk." Jack I remember when I was a young boy I had an autograph book, too Erik Estrada said to me "Hang in there." I told him I had an enlarged heart It's a petition The zoo wants to separate the gay penguins They want to send Doug to the Bronx Zoo to mate with a female Oh, great Gays can't get married but women in the Bronx can have penguins imported just for sex? That is awful They'd never separate them if they were straight penguins They'd just give them a huge tax break and let 'em kiss on TV Just the thought of those two guys being split up, that really gets to me Yeah, me too Oh, look, the giraffe is peeing! That's hilarious! I should buy an apartment closer to the zoo You should come to the rally tomorrow A lot of my lesbian friends are going to be there I'm not a lesbian myself I mean, sometimes I fool around with them And I live with one Oh. I guess I am a lesbian Weird I just came out I'd say welcome, but it sounds like you've been on that bus for quite a good long time now Oh, look. That one penguin's cleaning his nest and stacking his fish so neatly Oh, that's Randall He's a real fussbudget And the other one the goofy one that's Doug He always waddles into Randall's nest unannounced Oh, yeah, look Doug just stole his fish And now Randall's gonna act annoyed and be all, "Waah!" Even though he loves it I'm worried about him If Doug gets sent away - Randall will fall apart - Really? 'Cause Randall looks pretty together You know, except for the lollipop stuck to his back He's gonna be devastated when he's all alone He just doesn't know it yet My girlfriend did this study on gay penguins that were separated The one that stayed behind he was a mess What happened to him? Well, he gained a ton of weight and all of his feathers fell out This is the last stop on the tour It feels almost inappropriate giving a tour of the penthouse on a the day of Crystal's memorial Oh, my God That dress is gorgeous This is a 1954 custom-made couture gown The only one like it in the world Crystal wore this gown to the 29th annual Academy Awards escorting the lovely and talented Rock Hudson She had no idea Can you believe it? You know what? I can Oh, it really is beautiful I'd love to feel the fabric Ooh! Uh-uh! No, no, no Miss Adler, you mustn't touch it This gown is going to the Smithsonian tomorrow It's going to be put in their permanent collection Oh, how exciting for you A dress in the Smithsonian And your parents in the Museum of Miniatures Uh, Beverley It's the minister He wants to know where to set up the mechanical bull Oh, I'm coming! Such a sad, sad day Honey that's the dress That's the dress you should wear in your lonely holiday card Oh, my God you're right I would look so lonely in that I mean lovely Lovely Come on, try it on I'll take your picture with my camera phone I can't try it on It's the woman's memorial It would be so disrespectful And I don't care if there is a cake that says "See Ya!" in frosting Honey, try it on Please You'd look stunning in it I would, wouldn't I? Oh, honey, you look so beautiful dressed as a woman I know, right Come on, let's take your picture One dignified, one kooky Guess we're doing kooky first Ladies, the service is about to begin That's good enough. Okay Quick. Help me get out of the dress Be careful unzipping it Honey, I know how to get a woman out of a dress I was very popular at Sarah Lawrence Huh Huh? What do you mean, "huh"? Well, the zipper is just a little stuck. Here, let me just-- Karen, it's really delicate I know it's delicate-- Let me just get in the right - Oh! There! I got it - Okay. Good. Oh, my God. Karen your dress is caught in my zipper! Beverley's gonna kill me You think it's bad for you? I think a little bit of my boob is caught in there Good Ow! This is not gonna work, Karen Beverley's gonna see that I'm wearing the dress It's gonna be fine. Just keep this blanket on and walk in unison Just two friends in mourning Nothing suspicious Nothing lesbian going on Yeah, then why's your hand on my breast? Somebody's gotta steer this thing It'd be a hell of a lot easier if I had a bigger wheel to work with Why did you make me try this on?! Quit yelling at me I'm trying to get us unstuck Well, just keep working on that zipper While you're down there will you pull my underwear out of my ass? Hey, hey! Miss Adler, what on earth are you wearing? Oh this is the new floor length mourning shawl From J Crew Do you like it? It's-- it's catalog only Strange, 'cause it looks exactly like the blanket that Crystal died in Oh, God! Karen, may I talk to you just a moment? Why, sure, Beverley I meant in private Oh, I'm so sorry, that's so rude of me I'll just wait over there Karen, it's personal Oh, I'm sorry of course Don't mind her She's like a bird probably already asleep Karen, it would mean so much to me if you would come up to the podium and say a few words about Crystal Gosh, Bev, I don't know Oh, Crystal thought so highly of you We often discussed inviting you into our marriage in a sexual way That's so flattering Although, I don't know if I could have operated a pump and a defibrillator at the same time Oh, of course I'll speak Karen Everyone sit down The service is about to begin Oh, come on, relax We've got plenty of time before they get to me. I'll get us unzipped Welcome, everyone. Let's begin with a few words from Karen Walker There you are. Come on, help me make some signs for the rally at the Zoo Here, take a marker and start drawing penguins It's easy, all you do, you just gotta start with Paul Giamatti and then stop there I can't, Will I got a lease to sign That's right I found an apartment - So fast? - I konw It's all the way down in Tribeca New kitchen, two bedrooms And as soon I heard hardwood, I jumped on it Oh. That's great You've got a new apartment Meanwhile, Randall and Doug's love igloo is melting beneath their webbed feet You sound like you're not excited I kinda thought you'd congratulate me Well, I'm sorry It's just little trivial compared to the civil rights issue coming to a boil at the penguin house! I don't get this This morning, you were all "Let's find you an apartment," and now you're mad Why the 160? Because even though some people don't think so these two little guys are family Will, relax It's not that big a deal They're just fish We eat 'em every day Not that big a deal? Jack, their whole relationship is gonna change I mean, once they're in separate zoos they're not gonna be able to swim together all the time or share some fish go for a waddle-- Sure, they'll wanna get together but-- but something is always gonna come up And then one day, they'll run into each other at the gym and it'll be all weird and awkward and Randall will be like "Oh, you look good" and Doug'll be like "Yeah, is that-- is that a feather toupee?" I mean, they used to be best friends and now they don't even know each other Will, would you wait a minute? No. I gotta go. Congratulations on your new apartment Finally Geez, it's like pulling teeth Grace would like to say the traditional Jewish prayer for the dead Oh, well, how delightful! Um Yiskadal Yiskadash.. um Osha gosha b'gosha Oh ruch-hatatamai Ohbladi-oblada Spielberg Katzenberg, Geffen Aahmen Oh, Miss Adler that was just beautiful! Thanks You know what else is beautiful? I just got us unstuck Thank God Okay, I'm gonna go get out of this Beverley, I am so sorry! No, no. I don't wanna hear it I don't want to hear it! Miss Adler how dare you come into my home and desecrate the day I have set aside to celebrate my wife's death?! - Life - Life! Why do I keep saying that? I'm sorry I feel so horrible No, I just want you to go. Please Go, get out the dress See, but the thing is, the zipper's tricky And see, it's-- it's stuck again I'll help! I'm good at that. No, stay away! Hey, Will I'm glad I found you There's another protest going on over at the seal tank I guess they're gay, too because apparently people don't want them to go clubbing You know, I thought about what you said and I realized you weren't talking about the penguins, You were talking about us You're like a rice cooker It takes you a long time but when it comes out, it's perfect I'm sorry about before I just-- I was being selfish and I was wrong And I'm really excited about your new place Oh, thanks, Will But I'm not moving All that money I had is gone I spent it on some stupid impulse buy Hey, guys guess what? An anonymous donor just gave the Bronx Zoo enough money to buy its own penguin Doug and Randall don't have to be separated But don't say anything I wanna tell them myself An "anonymous donor"? I can't believe you did that I can't believe they called it an anonymous donor I said my name, like, 30 times It's supposed to be on the news! I'm so impressed with you And I never even though about donating money How did you know how much to give? I'm not an idiot, Will I think I know how much a penguin costs But that was your apartment money You were gonna sign the lease I can't believe you did that for me No, not just for you You made me realize I don't wanna move either And I thought if we get to stay together they should too Even if one of them is fat and bald Look at them They really are cute, aren't they? Yeah. Why is that female one always hanging around them? Here, let me try It's really delicate Yes, I know it's delicate! I put it on Benji a hundred times I just have to get a run at it There! Okay.

I can't. Remember?

I would love to join you and Bobbi for lunch I don't know why but I'm in the mood for roast turkey And a parade It's so great you're coming She loves you Of course, she's always been obsessed with gay guys. So sad Will, I need something from you I'm sorry, Karen. I literally peed two minutes ago Not that. I'm trying to teach my staff how to spot terrorists Could you come by around 3:00 and dash through the foyer with a backpack? Can't. I'm starting my new job at the Coalition for Justice It's a non-profit that helps people that can't afford lawyers Oh, well, honey, I'm sorry You'll find a real job soon - It is a real job - Right And this is my first liver I think what Will's doing is inspirational I don't know why but I'm feeling really thankful today Is the game on?

I can't wait until she's the age where I can tell her we already had lunch yesterday Well, don't you want to ask Bobbi where she'd like to go? She would like to go to Schraft's in 1952 and be discovered by Swifty Lazar Grace, you know I don't speak Jewish Oh! That was embarrassing Don't worry They're in tight now Grace, honey, why don't you hurry up and change for lunch? This is what I'm wearing to lunch Oh! Are we going to the lesbian bar? We could. I hear the Honey Bucket has a great spread This is a very nice outfit mom This shirt cost more than your wig Oh. Well, I like it 'cause it's cheap You can throw it in the dishwasher Well, that would probably explain this corn on the cob holder Can we just go to lunch? Oh, well I hope you can take me someplace nice for a change What does it matter where we go, Mom? You're just going to order chicken chow mein and hot water for the tea bag that's in your purse Oh, well the tea bag goes in the place in my wallet where the pictures of the grandchildren usually go Welcome Here's your desk right here Ah! Mission control So, uh, put me to work I'm ready to fight for the little people Take down some bad guys Dole out justice, Truman style Ok. I'm gonna go grab your first case That could have been embarassing Morning Oh, yeah. That desk only has three legs Yeah. That's what I like about non-profits A little rough around the edges The last place I worked all the desks had four legs Asses - Here's the file - Ah. Ooh. Tenants' rights "Horrible living conditions brown water rats and roaches" Juicy! So, what morally bankrupt monster am I taking down? "Karen Walker" Yep, that sounds about right Ugh. Thank God she's gone All that's left of her are a few strands of pink horse hair and a few flecks of Polident Yeah, thank God that's over I could not take more than one lunch like that a year - I know. She's a nightmare, right? - I'm talking about you, Mister! - What?! - I am appaled by how you treat her That woman is your mother! Mother! - You are so cruel to her! - Me?! What about her? Did you not hear her constant insults? I may have missed a few She's gotta learn to hold for laughs But, that's not the point. You need to treasure her insults while you can Because one day she'll be gone and you'll have to hear how much you suck from her ghost You don't know anything about it Oh, my dear No one knows how to be a good daughter better than a gay son The mother of a gay son learns to accept him for who he is Except for the sex The gay son learns to accept the mother for who she is Except for the sex Sadly, mothers and daughters rarely embark on this right of passage Thus, they are destined to perputate a pattern of anger and bitchiness This would be so much clearer if I had my slides I've seen your slides And I don't know what two Norweigan men farming naked has to do with me and my mother Grace, if you want this relationship to change you're the one who's going to have to change it Please. Let me help you Let me make you a good gay son Except for the sex Thanks. But I'll pass I'm as gay as I'd like to be This morning when I was getting dressed I actually considered putting a sock in my pants Well, it needs something down there Jasmine, you have such beautiful hair I'd like to see it on my dresser by bedtime You know, some people say "thank you" when they get a compliment I just got another "Help Me" note from one of your maids Oh, great. Thanks So, I, uh, started my new job today Mm. That thing where you save the world and get paid in soup? Doesn't sound like much of a job to me Karen, the work I do is incredibly important I have dedicated my life to helping those who can't help themselves You know, since this morning I.. My first clients live in a run-down building in Spanish Harlem that the owner refuses to bring to code Riveting. Why are you here? Well, because the landlord is someone we both know Oh. I see Well, I appreciate your taking the time to tell me in person So. Marlo Thomas is a slumlord - No, it's not Marlo - No, no, no! Let me guess! - It's you, Karen - I said let me guess. Is it me? - Yes it is - Yay! Look, I should be filing this right now but I came down here to give you a chance to clear this up out of court I mean.. The evidence is over-whelming This case is a slam dunk Slam dunk! Shaquille O'Neal! Okay. I don't know what that was. but.. You have got to fix this building So just sign these papers agreeing to cover the costs You can make this whole thing go away How do I make you go away? You know, years ago, a guy refused to fix up his building and they made him live in it You know, and what's worse they made a movie out of it and they cast Joe Pesci to play him - You want Joe Pesci to play you? - Kiss my A I'm sorry, what did you say to a representative of the Coalition for Justice? Gosh, I don't know. Why don't you get your D out of your ear and listen to me What? What is the matter with you? And why are you using letters? Because I'm a lady, assface Okay. That's it You've got yourself a fight Take your best shot, Fairy Mason Karen Walker is above the law! You can't touch me! If you go more than 100 feet from this building you will be arrested Enjoy your new apartment Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens Hey. I can't sleep because I keep thinking about my relationship with my mother Really? Or is it because it's only 6:00? Jack says I'm horrible to her Do you think I'm horrible to her? I'll answer that, but I'm gonna be honest Eh, forget it What are you up to? Well, I got big news I finally did it Today, I stuck it to The Man Oh. Finally That was a long dry spell Not that, Karen I got the judge to order her to pay for all the improvements to that building she owns Oh That's great Good for you Nah, good for the people And, uh, I also got him to sentence her to live in the building for a week Really? That sounds kind of harsh It's not harsh, Grace It's my job I dole out justice Truman style Why can't you say you "go to work" like everyone else? I don't say "I dole out furniture Adler style" Trust me It's the right thing to do You know, maybe if she spends a little time in that building it'll give her a chance to really look at herself Think about what she's done Have you really looked at yourself? What's that supposed to mean? I mean what are you doing? You got her to pay for something she probably didn't even know about until you told her Why wasn't that enough? Well, it's complicated Doesn't sound complicated I mean, you took the job because you wanted to become more compassionate, right? - Yeah, I did / - Then, why don't you start with your friends? You're right. I should go down there and see how she's doing And dole out some friendship Truman style Is anyone encouraging that? Okay. I'm ready I'll do whatever it takes I wanna be a good gay son Like Dick Cheney's daughter You're doing the right thing It'll be easy Alright, now, all you have to do is not take the bait when your mother provokes you All right? Now, I'll be Bobbi And you be you And no matter what I say, don't react Just sit there, relax and do nothing I don't know that I can do that Pretend you're having sex with a man just because he bought you dinner - Got it - Okay Now.

All right, I am gonna tell you something I've heard from my own mother my entire life "Put down that Barbie"? No. You're being an idiot So what if she insults you? Who cares? The bottom line is she loves you - Well, why can't she act like she does? - She does Every day of your life when she shatters your ego and makes you feel like nothing it comes from a place of love Oh, that's sweet Twisted, but sweet - Karen, it's Will - Go away! Come, on. Open up I dropped my rubber gloves in a puddle of pee I can't open the doors with my elbows What do you want? Get in here Well. Your timing could not be worse I'm right in the middle of a game Marisol, Concepcion this is Will The maricon I told you about Hola, Se?or She asked if you know Elton John And then she said you look like a big mincing queen Such an efficient language Ladies, why don't you take your cigars and go up to the roof You can touch my mink one more time on your way out Okay. Alrighty Karen, I wanna apologize for putting you through all this What are you talking about? I'm fine I've got everything I need A can opener, a "terlet" that's not connected to anything and all the lead paint I can eat Look, you don't have to put on a brave face for me Even though, I'm sure it cost you a fortune I..

You just pushed my buttons Well, isn't this funny? You know, if anybody had asked me I would have said that you were pushing my buttons - Really? - Yes I would have written that check right away if you hadn't come in all high and mighty acting all mighty when I was high So, we both behaved badly out of pettiness and spite Yeah. And maybe a little 'roid rage Oh. Honey, why do we do it? Why are we always at each other? Can you imagine what Nora Ephron would do with our story? No, but I'm sure it would feel familiar And we could sleep through most of it Look, I'm gonna make a call I'm gonna get you out of this No, honey That's okay I'll finish out my week It'll be good for me Anyway, thanks for stopping by I'm gonna run up to the roof and meet the girls - Mind if I keep you company for a bit? - Why, no.

No, no, no. No, Jordie that's a bad idea Grandma doesn't really like Christmas shows Really? But I've been planning it for months I know, and I'm-- I'm sorry But it makes her uncomfortable She'd rather see little boys playing in the show than than singing in the rain Jordie. Take five Have a smoke and a carrot stick Your aunts need to talk shop What's going on here? I don't remember driving into the town from Footloose Let the boy dance! I know my mother You have no idea how many of my little plays she ruined Talking and fidgeting And doing anything to distract the family from watching her gay son do fan kicks in the beanbag chair You poor thing Ow! Let the boy dance! I just don't want to see Jordie humiliated like I was I used to be so upset, I'd spend the rest of the night scarfing down butter cookies and pretending the crinkling of the wrappers was was applause I'm sorry. I had no idea - Ow! - Let the boy dance! Karen Try my famous holiday cocktail the Blue Marilyn I started drinking them to prevent thoughts of suicide But now, they're just fun Oh. Delicious! What's in it? Uh-uh-uh, family secret I can't tell you I bet I can guess Blue Curacao, vodka, a splash of Peach Schnapps, some bitters and a pinch of something powdered Oh sugar Oh, perfect! You guessed them all - Ah-ha! I knew it! - Except one Has anyone seen Sam? Did you check down your pants? Oh, I sent him up to the attic to find the menorah for you, Grace We still have one from when our Jewish neighbors came over Yeah Oh, it's a shame they had to move Oh, well The neighborhood association is very strong So what's going on? Things with you and Sam heating up again? Is that a tear-away tux? Hardly I tried to talk to him and he cut me off Every time I walk into a room he finds a reason to leave God, I hate when people are rude Will, come here I wanna show you something Yeah, I saw it You put the wise men in a threeway Put it back before my mom looks outside No. That Oh, my God He's stuffing himself with butter cookies Well, it's your work Why don't you go sign it I'm looking at myself thirty years ago Only without the Mork and Mindy suspenders Jordie Hi, Uncle Will Spit out those empty calories and put on your tap shoes I don't care what Grandma says we're putting on a show! - Really? - Yes, really! Now, go run around the yard! I want you five pounds lighter for the opening number! Wow. This is the most organized attic I've ever been in "Gifts from the Housekeeper." "Gifts from the Gardener." How sad. "Gifts from Grace"?! Yeah, my mother was never good at accepting gifts When I was in the fourth grade I made her an ashtray She said, "Great Now I've got to get you something." Well, uh, the menorah isn't where she said it was So, I guess I'll be going downstairs Sam, no. Come on You've been dodging me all night What's going on? Nothing I just I just don't want to talk to you Oh, well, that-- that makes me feel better I'm sorry, you're right That didn't come out right Grace, it's just that, um, I'm afraid if I'm alone with you something might happen I'm less offended Keep going Not that I'm assuming you'd even wanted to Oh, I don't I mean, even on the ride here I, uh, I announced that, you know I didn't want anything to happen with you Oh. Super I'm glad that my lack of desirability deserves an announcement No, that's not-- that's not what I mean I agree with you that, you know nothing should >I was-- I was worried that you didn't like me Oh, God, no Grace, I, uh I do I do like you Well, good 'Cause I like you, too That's good So, we're agreed We like each other and nothing's gonna happen Agreed - You look hot - Agreed Oh. God, that's the only time a menorah got me to first base Not me All right there's not enough of us to do a "Partridge Family in a Pear Tree" How about this? You pop out of the fireplace with a mask on You're the Phantom of the Chimney Ooh, I like that And Jordie, we can make an opera cape out of well, your opera cape I should steam the wrinkles out of that I wore it to bed last night So sad. A boy his age should be sleeping in a kimono - Did you warn your mother, yet? - No, no. No It's better if we spring it on her The more time she has to think about it the more time she has to ruin it Just like she ruined my 1975 Easter show Everything's Coming Up Jesus Is the secret ingredient anything in the blood family? I don't know how I can make this any clearer There are no bodily fluids in a Blue Marilyn Now, please, just give up 'cause you're never gonna get it Oh, I will. I will discover your secret ingredient! Even if it is the rarest, most exotic essence found on the planet Is it milk? No Oh, Sam, did you find that menorah for Grace? Uh, no, we couldn't find it but we looked for a very long time Oh Well, did you check in the drawers? Uh, we didn't have time Maybe later - Did you look in that little chest? - Do not answer that Well, let's look again because I know it's up there Oh! I used it last August to hold the bug repellent candles Yeah, yeah I remember 'cause it stopped the Jewish mosquitoes from biting Instead, they just had a little nosh Well The tousled hair the slightly smeared lipstick the disheveled clothing Either you're on your way to work or the holiday whore is back! Sam and I made out in the attic It was so hot! I know I said I wasn't going to do it, but I've liked him for a long time And he's single now Or is it just too wierd? For your entire life, fate has been cruel to you in almost every way So Maybe this time fate stepped back took a good look at you and said "You know what? Enough already" I say go for it You know what? I will For all the good I do, I deserve something good to happen to me What is wrong with these things? I don't know where you get your jewelry but this necklace is delicious Don't start without me Mom What are you doing? Getting ready to enjoy the show What's your game, woman? And now, ladies and gentlemen introducing Jordan St. James! That's a stage name I had to nix Dame Jordy Dench Santa Claus, Mr. Santa Claus I get the kids' applause Mr. Santa Claus That boy is the next Wayne Newton How many Blue Marilyns have you had? - Will, shush! - You shush! Will, you shush! Will you shush! This is Jordie's moment And keyboard solo Jordie, you're in the audience for this, sweetheart All that Claus! That Claus Bravo! Bravo! Okay, that is it! How dare you enjoy your grandson's Christmas show right in front of me?! Well, William, what is your problem? Oh, I don't know, maybe it's that you ruined every single Christmas play I ever did! I mean, you give him a standing ovation but for me, you'd be fidgeting looking at your watch, melting a cherry Sucrets into your stupid "secret" drink Ah! A-ha! Unbelievable! Will just had to steal the spotlight It's okay, Jack I don't mind He stole it from me, Jordie Grow up Oh, Will I don't get it How can you be so encouraging to Jordie when you were always so awful to me Darling, I think When you were a child, I think I I just handled everything badly You know, I wasn't prepared to raise a gay son - You know, it was the 50's-- - It was not the 50's! Darling, because of who you are and what you've become I realized that I I just should have done things differently I learned from you, Will - Really? - Yeah And even though I can't change the past I can try to be better with Jordie, you know? Wow Thank you, mom That means a lot to me - Wow. When did you do all this? - Ah, before the show During the encores, I was worried the house was going to burn down I can see why Five of the candles are on a box marked "Dry Hay" - Sam, this is so-- - Romantic? Wonderful? Excessive? It's, uh, it's excessive, isn't it? It's a lot Oh, God, I'm sorry I'm just so worried about that God, I just can't remember what it's like to be in the beginning of a relationship, you know? Just thought it'd be a lot easier jumping right into the middle of one I know it does Right after Leo and I split up Um After Leo and I, every guy who opened the door for me got my house key I spent a lot of money changing locks that year And it was because I was so afraid of being single And I think you might be too Well, I'm not afraid I'm, uh I'm terrified And I think you need to be - Terrified or single? - Both Ah. Fun You'll make it I did Okay So how about this? Next Christmas you and me, right here And we see where we are then That sounds great - Is it incredibly hot in here? - Like a thousand degrees Hey, Jordie I just got off the phone How would you like to perform our show next Christmas at Radio City Music Hall? I'd love it! It would be fantastic! Good. Then you try calling They keep hanging up on me Marilyn Thank you Dinner was wonderful I have a delightful buzz and my sore throat went away By the way I put something in your coffee Tell me when you figure out what it is ÀÚ¸· Á¦ÀÛ - ³×ÀÌÆ® µå ó¸  24 ÀÚ¸·ÆÀ Á °ÇºÎ ¹èÆ÷ / ¼öÁ¤ ±ÝÁö ¹èÆ÷½Ã ÀÚ¸· ÃâÃ³¸¦ ²À ¹àÇô ÁÖ¼¼¿ä

Oh, I know. Doesn't that Hershey bar look delicious? I'm talking about the cute guy, not candy Later hosen Here you go What am I supposed to do with this? Well, you're supposed to tear it in two give me one half and I guess keep the other half for your big theater scrap book I'm not an usher Well, then why are you dressed like an usher? I'm not. I'm Captain Von Trapp I have seven singing children and my cold heart was recently melted by a young nun Where do you think you are? Uh, at the Sound of Music Sing-Along Where do you think you are? At the 7:40 showing of Memoirs of a Geisha Ooh. I think you're in the wrong place If this isn't the theater showing Memoirs of a Geisha then why are all these people coming out going "Eh" Hey - Where are you? - Where are you? - I'm right by the door - I'm by the door I don't see you Are you at the entrance at 39th? That's the last time I let you give me directions while you're eating a muffin Well, get here as fast as you can I'm all dressed up as Maria I look like an idiot without you While I, in a Viennese captain's uniform fit right in at the 7:40 showing of Memoirs of a Geisha I'll be there as soon as I can like you've got a long, long way to run Heh. I guess I'm the one that looks like a complete fool. Heh-heh Don't feel too bad. My shoes don't match my belt Actually they do I can't believe I'm in the wrong theater Well Maybe you're not So. Tell me something, peanut brittle If we were boyfriends would I be able to get free nachos? - Yes. Would you like some free nachos? - Oh, no I couldn't! I'm watching your figure I was just in the bathroom and what do you know I just scored a few of my favorite things It's official Ralph and I are in love His butter might be fake but his feelings for me are very real All right. I have to wait for Will You go and save seats in the front row of the balcony I brought marionettes to dangle over the orchestra during "Lonely Goatherd" if you put even half this much energy into finding a man Nah, probably still wouldn't work I'm double parked. Can you keep an eye on them for a second? - Uh, no. Not really.. - Thank you! Wh..? Hey! What do I look like? Some kind of nanny? So, what is it about the Sound of Music that makes otherwise reasonable people dress up and act like lunatics? You're asking the wrong person I'm just going for my friends I'm not really a fan. I think the whole movie is dopey and sentimental.. - Oh, really? 'Cause I love it - Oh, thank God, because I love it, too! I know the lyrics to every song and the last time I was hiking a helicopter flew over and I twirled and twirled 'til I threw up Wow. I, uh, I guess I just like it then Excuse me - Hello? - Where are you? I think I met someone! I don't see how that's possible, because every gay man in the city is in this theater There's so much lisping going on, it sounds like someone poked a hole in the lobby I just have to run off to the bathroom Do you mind if they sit with you and your girls? - No, they're not my.. - Thanks! Oh, this sucks! - Just hurry up! - All right Sorry - Problem with Maria - I see How do you solve a problem like Maria? How do you catch a cloud and pin it down? - I'm done with those - Yeah, me too Hey. I brought us some sodas And Ralph gave me fire balls Try not to itch, honey It only makes it worse Thank you Ah Just the right amount of soda You brought liquor into a movie theater? That is so classy Well Everything I do has a touch of class, Jackie You hit someone! Oh, he's okay, though. But his wife is complaining to an usher She's really steamed Which I guess is appropriate, since she's dressed as a bright, copper kettle Crap. I had to hit one of the six straight people here They're so litigious They're all like "Oh, I got hit by a bottle" You hit a queer and they're like "Did I just get hit by a bottle? Eh. All in a day" Karen, that is an ugly and offensive remark which has no basis in reality Eh. All in a day We'll be holding the film until we find the person who threw an object from the balcony I don't care Hold it If you have any information as to this person's identity or whereabouts please report to an usher immediately Big deal. Like what are they gonna do? What we are gonna do is call the police and have them arrest the guilty party - Karen, we gotta get out of here! - Hold on, hold on Do you have any leads? - I guess he went on break - Go! Okay, let's make a run for it Honey, we can't My name was on that flask You put your name on the flask? Yeah. It says "Karen Walker Bikini Inspector." I got it on spring break I hardly saw you that trip. You were so into your "Rich Women Gone Wild" shoot Okay. So you go back in the theater and try and find it - I'll see if Ralph has heard anything - Okay Hello, Ralph Listen I heard somebody threw a flask over the balcony? - Any idea who that was? - How did you know it was a flask? - I didn't. You just said it was - Oh, that's right Well, they still don't know who did it - You didn't see anything, did you? - No. Once Karen threw it, I just ran Right. Well, if you hear anything let me know Oh, great. Child care Child, yes Care Ugh. I can't believe I'm missing this movie Where the hell is Will? We don't know so please stop asking You know, what? You're right I apologize to you And you And yieu, and yieu, and yieu If you were gay, you'd be rolling Why? Is that from the movie? Well, yeah, it's from.. Have you never seen this? It's just.. It's a.. It's just the best movie ever! What kind of parents do you have? Well, they left me here with you So you don't know any of the songs? Okay now. I'm starting to think I was sent to you children for a reason I'm going to teach you But where to start? Ah! "Let's start at the very beginning A very good place to start" Is this how it sounds in the movie? Kinda. Her voice was warbly sometimes Mine is a little more pure When you read you begin with-- Grace, Grace, Grace Karen threw a flask over the balcony and they're gonna hold the movie until they find her On the plus side Ralph and I just had our first kiss and his lips taste like Snowcaps So, James, you're seeing Memoirs of a Geisha alone, on a Saturday night No matter what anybody says I don't think that's sad I agree. Sad would be showing up dressed as a kimono Unless that's what you're planning to wear when you see it which would be cool No. That would be crazy It's January. You know how hard it is to get sidewalk salt out of raw silk? I feel I need to say this I'm not a drag queen You know that, right? - Sorry / - I guess Maria's got a lot of rollover minutes - Hello? - Where are you? Oh.. I'm.. I'm on the train Yeah, it doesn't sound like you're on a train / Well, I am Don't do fake train to me I taught you fake train - I taught you fake train! - That's fake train? Sounded more like fake dishwasher When would you ever need fake dishwasher? Hey. Listen to me Karen's in trouble She threw a flask over the balcony and hit someone If they catch her, they're gonna press charges. Get over here I.. I'm sorry It's alright. I heard It's cool My movie started ten minutes ago anyway - Oh, no, you're missing the previews! - Yeah, and they're my favorite part Me too Go Uh, listen, this was fun - Yeah, it was, I'm glad we, um.. - Me too - Okay. Bye - Bye-bye Oh, goodness. Finally! - What happened? - I'm sorry. I.. I just.. Wow. I didn't realize your costume was going to be this elaborate - Where is Karen? - I have no idea Shh! There is no Karen! I'm Sister Frances Beaverhousen Well, I got there too late One of those ushers had already taken my flask to the manager's office Calm down. I'll go talk to the manager I'm sure we can work something out I'm surprised you can wear that thing without your skin burning - I feel scared - Me too Me too! Aw, sweetie, come here Everyone gather around You know what I do when I feel scared? Fart a little and then deny it? No. Well, after that I try to think of some of my favorite things. Like "Raindrop on roses and whiskers on kittens" "And then I don't feel so bad!" Oh, thank God! - "Rain.." - Alright, enough! - Will, what happened? - The manager's such a jerk He wouldn't listen to reason So, I threw some paper clips in his face and I grabbed the flask Oh, thank God! - Empty! - Karen! Devil! We gotta get out of here They're after all of us now - Why me? - They heard you singing We can't get out They posted ushers at every door Trained movie theater ushers We're von trapped! I know! I'll find Ralph - He'll help us - No We can't trust him Can we? Who is he? Well, then who can we trust? What about me, lady? - Rosie! What are you doing here? - I wouldn't miss it I played Gretl in the El Salvador First National production Oh, Ro-Ro. I would have payed six chickens to see that It was an equity theater you racist bitch Now, quick. Hide in there before I change my mind. come on Oh. I.. I have to at least say goodbye "So long, farewell.." Wierdly, this is not the first time a nun has urged me to stay in the closet How long are we supposed to stay in this filthy.. Oh. Hey, I got time Okay. Who's the guy? Are you going to see him again? I doubt it. All I know is his name is James I didn't even get a phone number - Why not? - I don't know. I.. You called. His movie was starting It just didn't happen So, you chickened out Pretty much. I don't know I just I guess I couldn't face What, Will? What is it you can't face? I don't know. I guess I just didn't want to seem desperate You know, I didn't want him to think that I was making more of it than it was Well, if he was talking to you then he must be desperate, too As soon as we get out of here you've gotta go back to the theater - You've gotta find him - No, it was just a drink. And.. And it probably did mean more to me than it did to him - Shh! I hear something! - Oh! Oh, thank God, Ralph! Wait, wait, wait Don't do it, Ralph You're not one of them Come on Go out the back way They're here! You're an usher Why do you have a whistle? I also coach soccer Captain.

I can't complain. Yoko Ono gave me two dollars for orange Tic-Tacs I think she likes me Oh, honey, she definitely likes you Yeah, I just passed her in the hallway and she asked me if she could buy the big wooden statue of sitting bull that's in my bathroom - Hi! - Karen! You are here When they said you were in the little girls' room I just assumed they meant the room where you keep the maids' children This is the most amazing party I have ever been to! Celebrities everywhere! You know the best thing to do at a party full of famous people? Treat them normally and let them enjoy their evening? No Play ass tag The person who touches the most celebrity ass without them knowing wins I just got Liza Minelli I think I broke her hip again Now, I know you said not to bring anything but I went ahead and made my award-winning Charleston Harbor pickled shrimp You didn't win an award You said look what I made for Karen and I said, "what do you want, a medal?" Great. Pickled shrimp Happy Rockefeller is gonna be farting all night long Hey, trust me People are gonna love it It's a sophisticated, elegant dish for a sophisticated, elegant evening I gotta piss Are you sitting down? Ah, there you are You are not going to believe who's here Antoine! Remember him? Thank you, dear We had that horrible break up when he cheated on me Literally on me I woke up and he was having sex with another man on top of me They had no idea I was asleep under the covers Since the whole thing played out in a display window at bed, bath & beyond, I was the laughing stock of that weird part of 6th avenue So now we meet again and I am a huge success while he's serving goat cheese tartlets to something called Gore Vidal Anyway, I'm gonna go rub it in his face Literally in his face Happy birthday, too Oh, Karen, I am so happy that you decided to throw yourself a big birthday party this year Yeah, it beats the three of us dragging you down to Chinatown every year for our little dinner I love Chinatown You can buy a bag of zippers this big for a dollar I hand them out to poor kids Aw, the look on their little faces as they zip and unzip their new toy Yeah, well, um, we should get back out there I don't want to miss a minute of the party I'm gonna try and get Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins in a double When are those two gonna get married already? I mean, we get it You're liberal Well, thanks for coming, kids Really I'm just so glad that you're all here What the hell are they doing here?! I specifically told you not to invite them! I'm sorry lady, I sent them invitations by mistake Oh yeah? I think the real mistake was when your father spotted your mother across a crowded swamp dragged her back to his hut and made you I never should have shown you our home movies Àª & ±×·¹ÀÌ½º Steams Like Old Times How many of these am I supposed to take again? A yes, eight All right, that's it I am no longer watching the "today" show And not just because Katie Couric has so many highlights it's like looking directly into the sun Matt Lauer has insulted me What happened, honey? Did he make fun of your forehead? Or your beady eyes? Your gay mouth? What was it? I saw him take a bite of one of my Charleston Harbor pickled shrimp make a big, stupid face, and then throw it behind the fireplace stools That's what you were doing on your hands and knees in front of the mantle I thought you met someone and were doing the gay presenting of the butt ritual Karen, that only happens in your disgusting imagination And Tuesday nights at baboon bar No, I was retrieving the shrimp so I could shame Lauer in front of his cronies and then I stood up and ripped my pants Please tell me you have a sewing kit here I didn't know anyone was in here I`m sorry - Hey, Mattie - Hey, Kare. How you doing? Do you mind if I grab a mint or something? I have this, bleh nasty taste in my mouth - Nasty? - Yeah What you have sir, is a lazy palate And by the way, where in the world are Matt Lauer's manners? - Oh, oh, hi - How are you? Oh, oops You already got me Ah, damn it Wow. Sounds like you kids are having kind of a bad night Maybe you should go home - Oh, no! - I'm having a great time! Fine. Well. I'm going to go open my presents from Stan Every year he hides my big gift in the overhang above his bikini area Check it out I just touched Philip Seymour Hoffman's ass and he grabbed my boob That man just got nominated for a golden globe and then he grabbed one of mine What do you think of that? I think "globe" is a little generous And he got some chicken pesto on your dress oh, no! I kept the tags on it so I could return it tomorrow! Oh, my gosh, I have got to get cold water on this right away Oh, my god, this is the biggest most obvious stain ever Wow, I guess you can actually be too gay Some of yours is leaking out Yeah. Antoine and I decided to talk So I sit down on this beautiful three-tiered chair when all of the sudden after a few seconds the whole thing gives out You know what it turns out it was? Karen's birthday cake? Oh. I was going to say antique cake chair but yours makes more sense Anyway, Rosie's coming in with a quick change of clothes while I take a shower Why don't you get undressed out here? And leave myself exposed for Will to jump me? No thanks Oh, wait, did Philip Seymour Hoffman have some of my pickled shrimp on his plate? I ask because it was right next to the chicken pesto, so it only makes sense No, no, no! No one likes your pickled shrimp You know why? Pickled Shrimp Yeah, say whatever you want They're gonna catch on Pretty soon, everywhere you look you're see gonna pickled shrimp Well, well, well I walk in on a naked man a man in his underpants and a woman who needs to leave Beverley this isn't a good time And I'm saying it could be Get out! Oh, settle down, woman Look at y'all I've never witnessed such inappropriate behavior No wonder Karen's never invited you to her birthday party What? This is the first time she's ever thrown herself a party Oh, my Have I been indiscreet? 'Cause I'd hate to be the one to tell you Karen's been having this party for ten years Really hate it Really Ten years Hate it I can't believe it This is impossible All these years and she's been lying to us It's worse than that Karen uses Costco shampoo! This is unbelievable All these years we've been talking Karen out on her birthday because we felt bad she didn't have a party And all along she was having this huge thing behind our backs I know I hate when people have huge things behind my back Usually Rosie, why has Karen had this party for ten years and never invited us until now? You weren't invited to this one either I screwed up and put you on the list It's outrageous! Why wouldn't she want the three of us here? You weren't invited because of one person and one person only Rosie? This is Rosie Come back Get out here I want to introduce you to Diane Sawyer I'm thrilled She's my idol We're thinking of doing a trade and she wants to check your hair for lice At least I have hair, lady One person What does that mean? Well, obviously she's embarrassed by one of us And she can't invite the other two so none of us get to come Well, who's she embarrassed by? Gee, I wonder who Mrs. Roper Yeah, well I don't get that reference to "Three's Company." While you two geniuses figure this out I'm going to go tell Karen that it's okay if I'm the only one she invites next year Because it's obviously not me she's embarrassed by In case anyone was wondering Beverley Leslie comes up exactly to my penis You still sure you're not the one she's embarrassed by? You basically just showed a leprechaun your pot of gold You told John McCain you loved him in "cheaper by the dozen." I fooled around with Antoine on top of all the coats If she's embarrassed by anybody, it's me Wait Anyway, it's obviously you, Grace Because, you know, you're a woman That's always a little embarrassing You know what I hear when you talk? "Blah blah blah blah blah." You know what I see when you talk? William hurt in a wig You are both embarrassing! If I had a party, I wouldn't invite either of you I wouldn't want to go because everything would be pickled! Do people not know how long it takes to pickle something? I had to buy a barrel for God's sake Those aren't easy to find You'd think they'd sell them at Crate & Barrel But, guess what? They don't They don't sell crates, either Hey, next time, save me the trip and name your store Ottomans & Wicker Crap! You're a pompous bore, Will What did you say to me? I said you are a pompous bore You are so dead! Stop! Stop it! Hey! Stop it! We are behaving like children! You're right This is not a good weapon Grace! You got Visine in my eye! What? Great Now I'm gonna have to climb back onto the roof and load them all back into the hatch Rosie! Get in here and clean this up Okay. Everybody clear out This Will only take a second Shouldn't somebody help her? Nobody helps her She makes 350 thousand dollars a year What kind of prescription plan are you on, by the way? I think it's the, uh, sneak a truck across the Canadian border plan Man, this is even harder than cleaning up that stinky, slimy pile of shrimp someone dumped in the ficas tree Okay. All done I'm sorry it took so long I had to change the bag I know. Isn't she fantastic? Honey, when I free you, you're getting forty-two acres and a mule Nope, a pony No, a cat Nah, I'm keeping the land You'll get a trick cat that can ride a pony and make a fortune Get out Now, what the hell happened here? Karen, why have you never invited us to this party? Oh. You found out about that Well This is only the second year I've had the party We know it's been ten Oh, you found out about that Well The reason that I did invite you this year-- We know Rosie invited us by mistake Oh, you found out about that Karen, come on Rosie told us you didn't invite us because of one person Who is it? It's Will, right? - It's not me, it's you! - No, It's you! It's you! And-- All right, all right, it's me! It's me, okay The one person is me You know how every year for my birthday you people take me out to some crappy dinner? Well, I guess I was afraid if you found out about this party you wouldn't do that anymore That crappy dinner is the thing I look forward to the most That's my real birthday Oh, Karen that's so sweet I've only ever been 90% sure you were human But, lady, you just bumped it up to 95 And to think that we-- we thought that you were embarrassed by us Now, come on How in the world could I ever be embarrassed by you? Honey, you got a tampon in your hair But if you were worried we'd cancel our dinner why didn't you just say something? Well, I'm a proud woman, Jackie Sometimes it's hard for me to talk about my feelings Plus I'm high most of the time so there's that If you want, we can still do dinner tomorrow night Oh, that'd be nice Happy birthday, Kare Okay. I can't wait any longer I need to tinkle Are you sitting down? See?

                    			This doesn't happen very often, does it? The two of us, just hanging out. I know. It's weird, isn't it? Let's make sure it never happens again. Absolutely. - Hey, guys. - Oh, thank God! A large coffee. Will. All of the charitable work you've been doing for the Coalition for Justice has inspired me. I have volunteered to decorate a nursing home in Brooklyn. Thank you. I realized I haven't done anything charitable since I helped feed the homeless. You threw Skittles at a whino. He ate them, didn't he? But seriously, I'm very proud of you. I'm glad you're volunteering. This is nice, isn't it? Just the three of us, hanging out. - Hey, guys. - Oh, thank God! Nice day out, huh? Well, I gotta take the subway to work. It's gonna take forever to get downtown, but I have to help my friend Bill. Bill of rights. Uh, maybe you didn't hear me, but I said Jack, are you okay? I sick. With the Evian flu. I shared a bottle of Evian with a stranger at the gym. Honey, if you're sick, you should come stay at the manse for a couple of days. It'd be fun, I could take care of you. You know, chicken soup, and comfy blankets, and leeches. Hey, we could raid my collection of old movies of the week! Oh, I love old movies of the week. Annie Potts is never better than when she's getting beaten up or someone's stealing one of her babies. Hey, Grace, you wanna come watch with us? Aw, that's too bad! Jackie, let's go! Hector, I've only got five minutes before I have to get back to the office. I want what I had yesterday. I don't remember what it was, and you weren't working, but I want it anyway. Hi. Margot, from Will's law firm, right? Don't tell me. Grace Adler, interior designer. I remember, because you smelled like doll head. So, you can set your own budget. What do you say? About what? Oh, sorry. I do this a lot. I rehearse conversations in my head and then I can't remember if I've actually had them or not. Listen, I want to redo the law firm. So, you can set your own budget? What do you say? Really? Wow. Oh, I just volunteered to, uh You know what? I will get back to you by this afternoon. I stopped loving you years ago. Excuse me? Sorry. I'm having lunch with my husband later. WILL AND GRACE Forbidden Fruit - S08 E012 Syncro: ovidurex Wow. I've never been in this part of the manse before. Oh. Well That's the gift wrapping room, that's the meat locker, discotheque, car wash, and then Down here we have liquor storage, liquor collectables, liquor dry goods, emergency liquors, and candles. Dipped in liquor. And, uh, I thought I'd set you up here, in Stan's library. Where does this door go? What door, honey? [POINTING] This door. There's no door there. You need to get your eyes checked. Why don't you go see optometrist, ten doors down on the right, just past Spencer's Gifts. Go on. This way Wait a minute. This is not one of those doors you open and then fall out the side of the building, is it? Of course it's not! Those are all marked "Door Sticks, Push Hard." Come on, Karen, I wanna look behind the door! All right, I'll tell you. It's not that big of deal. It's just that Well That's that's the forbidden room. - The what? - The forbidden room. Wow. So dramatic. The forbidden room. Reminds me of my nickname at camp Forbidden Fruit. Unless I was in a sleeping bag, then it was Fruit Roll-Up. Okay, no more ordering from restaurants with cutesy names. You know, "Curry in a Hurry" I can deal with, but "Tapas Don't Preach"? That's just going too far. Will, really big news. You know your old boss, Margot? I ran into her this morning and she asked if I would redecorate the law firm. I thought you were gonna do that job for the nursing home? I know, and I really wanted to do it, but I can't do both. And Margot said that the budget would be unlimited. The only thing unlimited at the nursing home was applesauce between two and four. I thought you said I inspired you to finally do something charitable with your life? Well, you did, and then it went away. Do I have to remind you that I quit that heartless, money-grubbing, corporate law firm and now you're choosing it over sweet, elderly people who just want to live out the rest of their days with dignity? Nice. When you say it like that, I feel awful. Well, you should, Grace. I was proud of you for doing something meaningful. - You were? - Yes. Okay, I won't take the job. Okay? I finally committed to doing something charitable and I'm going to see it through. That's my Grace. You're a good person. Just like Jake Gyllenhaal. I don't know, sometimes when I look at my screen saver, I think "Yeah, you're thinking about me, too." You know, I used to feel that way about Sarah Jessica Parker. But then, we shared an elevator ride together and she poked me in the boob with an umbrella and didn't apologize. Were you trying to hug her? That's not important. Thanks, Karen. Oh. B.T.W., I think I figured out what's in the forbidden room. It's my birthday present, isn't it? Damn it, Jack! You are just too smart. Something I've been excused of many times. Mr. Stan is upset. He can't fit in his skinny jeans. That man. He wakes up one morning, can see his feet and gets all cocky. Now, you stay in bed and stop thinking about your present. Hey, Rosie. Hasta manana. So, we haven't talked in a while. How are you? Mm. Not so good. My uncle died suddenly-- I don't care. What did Karen get me for my birthday? Nothing yet, but she's looking at the LL Bean catalog. What size duck boot do you wear? But, wait, if she didn't get me anything yet, what's she hiding in that room? What room? You know. The forbidden room. I never heard of a room like that, and unless you want to get yourself killed, you haven't heard it either. Rosie, wait-- No, I've already said too much. Don't follow me. Oh, come on. You know you can't outrun me! I'm so pleased you decided to accept this job, Grace. I am, too. Yeah, I can do a nursing home anytime. It's just plastic ficas trees and rubber mats. Oh, but listen. If you need to call me, don't call me at home. Use the cell or the office, but not home. Never home. You're hiding something. And I bet it's wickedly evil. You know, I belong to a secret club downtown that recruits young women-- Oh, hey, wow. Great. Good, Margot. Let's, um, let's talk about what you want for your office. I'm not sure what you mean when you say "tasteful bloodbath." So, Will, you quit your stupid charity job to come back to corporate law, huh? Didn't even tell Grace. How do you know? Well, whenever she calls you answer the phone, "The Coalition for Justice." What's the matter, Will? You ashamed you didn't save the world? Hey. I'm still doing noble work. Now, come on. Let's get cracking. We have a power plant to defend against a very whiney elementary school. I'll be right back, Margot. What am I thinking? I have a bobby pin. Oh, there. I can't do anything with hair in my face. Hey! What the hell are you doing by that door?! Look how pretty. I can finally see your face. Now, come on, honey. Let's get back in bed. Why do you keep trying to spoil your birthday present? Karen, I know the truth. Rosie spilled the beans. Then she told me there's no present in there. Now, I demand that you tell what's behind that door! Honey, I don't want you to know. But, we're friends. We're not supposed to have secrets! Yeah, well guess what? We do. What's behind that door is none of your business! Fine! You have a secret. I have to respect that. Truth is, I have a secret, too. You're trapped! I'm going behind that door! Oh, my God, I am trapped! Oh, I guess I can move these. Jackie, no! Why are you so strong?! And Rosie so fast? What is this place?! Oh! Oh, great! My forbidden door knob. All right, fine. You win. I'm too sick to fight. I won't go in your forbidden room. Oh, my God And then I was thinking on the walls we could hang photographs from famous landmark cases, like, you know Or we could just paint them mauve. I know I've said this, like, a thousand times, but Grace, you remind me so much of my sister. They never found her killer. Thank you? I'm gonna go get my, um, paint samples. Oh, no, I left them at home. Oh, I'll swing by later. I'm having an affair with a guy on 73rd Street. No, you can't. Why not? I'm not getting any at home. Uh, no, I mean, you can't come to my house. I-- I know this may sound strange, but I haven't told Will I'm working here. I don't understand. You know how Will is working for the Coalition for Justice? Really? He's working for the Coalition for Justice? It seems like only minutes ago I saw him in the break room. I know. He's such a good person. Anyway I told him that I wasn't taking this job, so I'd prefer if we could keep it between us. Of course. We're like sisters. You know, if one of us hadn't been murdered. Listen. Would you mind waiting here for me for a minute? There's something I need to check on. I need to talk to you. Gary, get back to your hole. Will, you are aware that I offered Grace a job, weren't you? Oh, yeah, she couldn't take it. Oh, why not? Do you know? Yeah, she volunteered to redecorate a nursing home. She's such a good person. You both are. Wait here, I wanna show you something. Sure, Margot. This is unbelievable. A baby's room? Why do you have a baby's room? I don't want to talk about it. You've seen, now let's get out of here! But, Karen, you can tell me anything. - No! - Please. All right, you've worn me down! Remember a few years ago, when I thought I was pregnant? Well, before I found out it was a false alarm, I had this room turned into a nursery. I haven't been in it since. Karen, you want a baby No, I don't! I don't know Sometimes I do think about how sweet it would be to see my child smear on my makeup and teeter around in my high heels. And if it was a girl, that'd be okay, too. See! Now that's why I didn't want to tell you. Because I didn't want to have to see that pity puss. Karen, I don't pity you. Yes, you do. "Poor little rich girl, wants the one thing she'll never have." It's so Farrah Fawcett in Poor Little Rich Girl or Meredith Baxter Birney in The One Thing She'll Never Have. Karen, I think you're being too hard on yourself. Like Joanna Kerns in Too Hard on Herself. Maybe. But, come on, Jackie. What kind of mother would I make? I'm impatient, I'm selfish, I mean Can I really take care of another human being? I'm not exactly the maternal type. But, Karen-- You do not sound good. Come here Oh, for Pete's sake, you're burning up. Now you get your keister back into bed, young man. Hush, little gay boy, don't you cry Grace, will you step into the break room for a minute? - Sure. - I'll be right in. I think you will find something to keep you occupied. I guess that's only funny to me right now. Oh, crap. - There you go. - Oh, thank you. What are you doing here?! Are you working here?! You lied to me! Me?! How long have you been working here and why didn't you tell me? I was going to, eventually like, when we're old and living in that nursing home you're supposed to be decorating. Oh, don't make this about me. [SIGHS] I really wanted to tell you I just You were so proud of me. You know, and I made a big deal of doing charity work. But, Grace That office It smelled like soy cheese and Raid. And, I'm sorry to disappoint you. And maybe it makes me a bad person, but I like doing corporate law. And I love doing it someplace pretty. I know you do. You could never disappoint me. You know what? I'm gonna make your office super pretty. Yeah, about that. Okay, fine, I took the job. And I didn't tell you because blah blah blah, disappoint you, blah blah, guilt, blah blah, old people freak me out, blah blah. Sorry. Aw, that was beautiful. If I'd known we were going to do blah blah's, I could have done that speech a whole lot shorter. Never go first, Will. Yeah. Grace? Yeah, baby? What the hell are you wearing? Hey, Karen. Sorry. I should have minded my own business. No, no, no, no. Honey, forget about it. I'm glad you made me come in here. Yeah. I think I'm finally ready to let go. You know what? I'm gonna turn this room into something practical. Like liquor storage. We just do not have the space. Hey, you know, just a thought, Kare but maybe you should keep it like this for a while. Well, yeah. Maybe I will. You know. Just for a little while. Back to my office. I want it-- I want it to look masculine. Then stay out of it. Good, you've worked it out. On company time. Really, what kind of relationship do you to have that you can't be honest with each other? It's disgraceful. Margot. Oh hello, dear. My husband. Yes, yes. Florida's beautiful. In fact, I'm in the water right now.   
                




                    			Good morning, Elizabeth. Is that today's mail? Yeah Can you start calling me Dave? My girlfriend found out about this whole "Elizabeth" thing and now she calls me that, and you know, I try to be cool with it, but it's kind of weird when we're making out. Well, of course it's weird. You're making out with a woman. That'll be all, Elizabeth. Ah! Yeah, yeah! You like that, don't ya, straighty? Hey, honey. Hey, Kare. You know what this is? A letter saying gays shouldn't be allowed on television? Because that would be horrible. And early. That thing shouldn't have gotten here until tomorrow. No, no, it's a piece of fan mail, from Tommy Shields of Lorain County, Ohio. He and his parents just visited New York and he saw an episode of "Jack Talk." "It was neat to see how comfortable you are being gay. It made me want to come out, but I am too scared." Aww, this is so sad. Okay, alright, but then it gets funny. Oh, but then it gets sad again. Ah! He ended funny. Good for him. All right. Karen, this is what I've been waiting for. The opportunity to make it seem like you can read? No! Can't you see? I have to go to Ohio and help little Tommy come out. That way he can come on my show and tell his story. This could be my Oprah moment! And then we goes to greet me, we'll do the Oprah hug. What's that? - Here. Try to hug me. - Okay. Good for you, good for you! WILL AND GRACE Cop To It - S08 E013 Syncro: ovidurex You know what? I bet Ellen's having another baby. How many kids is this for Rob and Ellen? Five? Six? And which one am I godmother to? The cross-eyed one, or the one with the weird ear? It's so annoying. Another kid, another gift. I'm tired of rewarding straight, married couples for not wearing a condom. I know, right. How many kids do you need? It's like they're trying for a good one, and that's not gonna happen. And the thought of them going at it, just rutting like pigs-- Thank you guys for meeting us at our favorite restaurant. You know, on two separate occasions, Ellen's water broke right over there. Yeah, we were here one of those nights. I remember because I was wearing sandals. So Someone looks like they've pudged out a little. Is there something you'd like to tell us? Sure. First of all, I'm not pregnant, so you just called me fat for no reason. - And secondly - Let me tell them. - No, let me. - Let's do it together. - Fine. Ready? - One, two, three. We're separated! Yep, we did it. Splitsville, Sayonara-town, Separation Station. No! No, no! You guys can't get separated. You've been together since college. You have five beautiful children or so I gotta say, you guys seem really okay about this. Actually, we have never been better. We used to fight all the time when we were together. And now that we're apart, it's like we're best friends again. Yeah. Well, I'm really happy for you guys. I'm not. You guys are the reason I believe marriage can still work. I mean, someone's gotta stay together besides Ben Stiller's parents. Grace, you know, for some couples, breaking up is the right thing to do. Will, you know that cop you used to date? Vince? Perfect example of breaking up being the right thing. I mean, I know that I've definitely grown and matured. No, I mean he's over there. Vince is here? Oh, God, please don't let him see me. Criss-cross-applesauce. Will, whatever happened between you and Vince? They broke up after he got fired from the force. Vince was kind of a mess and they agreed that he should take some time and get his act together. Buona sera. Anybody want something to drink? - Will? - Vince? You work here? Yeah. I think Will's water just broke. So, Tommy e-mailed me and said to meet him here. His job is spraying the shoes before renting them out to bowlers. Oh. When I was a boy, I worked in a supermarket. Oh! Did I say I was a boy. 'Cause I wasn't. I was a girl. Excuse me, do you bowl? Sure. I love to "bowl." You wanna do it here, or out by the garbage cans? I'm pretty sure these middle-aged women are asking you if you want to bowl. I'm 29. Welcome to Ohio. We're in a league and we're one short. Is there any way you can fill in? Oh, I don't think so. Our friend Peg couldn't make it because her hatchback wouldn't start. Your story has moved me. I'm in. Great. I'm Jean and this is Rhonda. Anastasia Beaverhousen. Nice to meet you. Now. I'll need a 12-pound ball and a big plate of fried food. From the looks of this place, my ass has got a lot of catching up to do. So, Vince You're a-- You're a waiter. That's great. Yeah. This is my gun now. You have the right to remain bland! Heh-heh Vince, anything you say can and will be used to make me laugh. It's so great to see you, Vince. Hey, you, too, Grace. How you doin'? Okay. You know, uh, let's see Work's great, still living with Will, but I'm gonna get out of there any day now. What else? Yeah, we're still waiting on waters and it's been, like, 10 minutes. The busboy gets that. Oh, gosh! Of course, I'm sorry. That was so obnoxious. It's just that the pitcher's just right there. I forgot you were like this. God, how sad is that? He's working as a waiter at The Pasta Village. Can you imagine anything more pathetic? I'd kill myself. Hi. I'll be your new waiter. And while I'm still alive, I'll be serving you. You-- You're our waiter? What happened to Vince? I think we're gonna need another minute. I'm still trying to decide if I want the lobster spelled with two "B"s and a trademark symbol. Grace, it is better than the real thing. The shell is made out of bacon. And then they inject it with cheese. And it's spelled with five "E"s. Can you believe that? I know. I am totally getting it. No! Not that. Vince sent another waiter to cover our table. God, this must be so awkward for him. You know, he went from crime doesn't pay to soup of the day. Go talk to him. So he's a waiter. There's no reason this has to be awkward. You're right, Grace. Oh, my God, I can't believe he's actually going over to see Vince. And I totally thought tonight was gonna be boring! Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. Confusion in his eyes, no product in his hair That's my boy. Hi. You need some help, don't you? Yeah, I do. Jack's here. Now. I know it can be very difficult to admit that you're gay. I'm not gay. I'm just looking for someone over 21 to buy me beer. All right, you might want to go talk to that lady over there. She can get you real messed up. If that's not Tommy Jack?! Jack McFarland? It's me, Tommy! Nope, not him either Hey. Vince, look. I don't want this to be weird between us. So you went from "I'll read you your rights" to "I'll bring you your Sprites." Knock it off! You know, that's a little condescending, Will. Waiting tables is an important job. Without waiters, people couldn't, like, eat. They could cook themselves. Yeah, but they couldn't eat in a restaurant. Well, they could go to places that have self-serve. Will, what are you doing? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-- Just drop it, okay? I'm in the weeds, man. Two busboys called in sick, so I'm picking up all my dirties. My hands are covered in sauce and influenza, and I'm freaking out because I just touched my eye. MAN: You know that guy? Yeah, he's my ex. MAN: That isn't going to be a problem, is it, detective? No. I'm sorry. I couldn't get rid of him. I just-- I'll just tell him I'm undercover on a drug bust. That's called blowing your cover. Just keep it together until the hand-off happens. Then we move in. Got it? Sir? I am totally focused on catching these sons of bitches. A birthday. I'm head clapper. One, two, three, four. Happy, happy Getting separated was a really hard decision, but once we made it-- - How'd it go with Vince? - we felt really good about it. I think we should leave. Really? 'Cause the first basked of unlimited bread sticks just got here. I mean, if we want, they can just keep coming forever. Vince can't even talk to me. For some reason, he thinks I'm going to judge him. Oh. Okay. So we're doing that again. Doing what? You're gonna leave him because he's a mess. Looks like that's turning into a pattern with you. No, no, he broke up with me because he wanted to get his act together. Oh, come on. You left him when he needed you most. You know, Ellen and I did the same thing-- Okay, shush. I'm talking. Maybe this is my fault. I feel stuck with him. What is it with me that I leave people when they need me most. You know, we need you guys-- Not now, Rob. You know, Grace We invited you guys here to talk about me and Rob And, well I feel that you're not really listening to us. That was hard. You did great, honey. You really did. No, I'm listening. The two of you are both making the biggest mistake of your lives. Got it. Wh--? No, Grace. We want to be single again. I want to experiment. I wanna go out and buy a Corvette and use a condom. Me, too! I feel all hot and sexy again. I wanna wear a belly shirt, Grace. You know I wanna go to clubs and eat angel dust. Wait a minute. That's what this is about? You want to date? Yeah. Oh, wow. Okay, well, you know, good luck. 'Cause I've been out there for the past two decades and it takes work to find someone who can stand you. And Ellen, God love you, but a belly shirt? I mean, you've been pregnant, like, thirty times. Every shirt you own is a belly shirt. Hey, what are you laughing at dough boy? You think some sexy co-ed is gonna wanna hang out at the Pasta Village with a forty-year-old accountant whose idea of sexy is making honking sounds while squeezing them? Honk honk You said you liked that. Well, it's better than Look. You're getting old. You're not very interesting. And you're both losing your hair. You belong together. If not for love, then for the mere fact that no one else is gonna take you. I am not losing my hair! I starting plucking the grey ones and I couldn't stop. You proud of yourself? Go get it. Honey, I just got a strike! And a fungal infection under my nail. Isn't that exciting? All I need is a factory job and a grey tooth and I'll fit right in. Karen. You see that old man over there? He's Tommy. Man, the Midwest takes a lot out of a teenager. I was looking for an Oprah moment, not a Willard Scott moment. There's no way I'm putting him on "Jack Talk." Jack, I can not believe that you won't help that man! Why should I? He mislead me. By using the name Tommy, he implied he was young, innocent, muscular and curious. Honey, if that man only had one day left and you could help him to live it honestly, then that's what you should be doing. What is more important than living life as your most authentic self? You're up, Anastasia. Stop following me around. You're not supposed to be in the kitchen. I just want you to know how sorry I am. It's fine. Just forget it, okay? Now go sit down. I still got ten more lobsters to pump full of cheese and paint little eyes on. Waiter, can I talk to you? I'll be right with you, sir Well, we're back together. We figured it's best for the kids. Yeah. We might as well make it all the way to the finish line. You know death. That's a cheerful way to put it. It's better than your way. "Best for the kids"? - The kids hate you. - The kids hate you! See, this feels right. Sorry your entrees are late. We're gonna comp your appetizer. What? No, we're not. Get lost, Will. Vince, this isn't you. Yes, it is. Now leave me alone. Look. Why won't you let me help you. You are not being true to yourself. - You are not a waiter. - Yes, I am. I think we both know you're a cop. - Will, be quiet. - I will not be quiet. You are a cop, Vince. You are a cop! Cops! Let's go! Man! They're going to the parking lot. Move! Would you look at that? He is a cop! By the way, I would avoid the ricotta cheesecake. There was a cat sitting on the box. Okay, Tommy, listen up. I have decided to help you come out. All right? I'm not gonna lie. Initially, I had some reservations. Because it's such a huge responsibility helping another person through this journey? No, it's because you're not what I call eye candy. You're more eye patch candy. Are you being bitchy? I heard of that. They do it all the time on "Designing Women"! All right, the first step in coming out is updating your references, okay? The second step, is telling your parents. I am so nervous, Jack. No, no, no. Look. I know this is hard, but it's so much better on the other side. I promise. Hey, why don't we start with someone here? All right? You know, for practice. Like, um, this guy over here. Excuse me, sir? Could you come over here? Yeah, great. This gentleman has something he'd like to tell you. Jack, I don't think-- No, no, no. Don't think about it. Blurt it out. Trust me. It'll make you feel better. Go. Yeah, what is it? I'm gay! Oh, my God. Dad, you're gay? Yes, Josh. And where did you get that beer? Wow. Two after school specials in one. Hey, I'm sorry. I had no idea you were undercover. It's okay. We caught 'em in, like, two seconds. They were exhausted from the lobster. It's got turkey in it. Mmm. So, you're back on the force, obviously. That-- That's great. Yeah. And I made detective. Wow! I gotta tell you. You know, I thought when we broke up, things sort of fell apart for you. Yeah, well actually, things got better. Yeah, I mean, you know, I got a promotion, and I'm dating a great guy. And I just found out I got one foot bigger than the other, so I got that going on. It seems like things are really going well for you. A guy, huh? Yeah. Hey, this is what you wanted, right? For me to get more independent, and get my act together Yeah, yeah. No, yeah. I'm happy for you. Thanks. Well I should go. I gotta go interrogate that piece of crap drug dealer. I probably don't have to worry about bagging up his dinner, right? I already did. Well, it was really good seeing you. Yeah. You too. You okay? What happened with Vince? He's not a waiter, he's dating someone and he's happy. Sweetie, I'm sorry. It's hard to find out your ex is happy. He's got one foot bigger than the other, so it's not all wine and roses. Did I make a mistake, letting him go? I don't know if it's possible to ever really know. Come on! 11% is a generous tip! I don't know what's grosser about you. Your cheapness, or the tiramisu you spit on the back of my neck. You make me sick! You make me sick! Well I did that. Pulaski's Bail Bonds is going to the semi-finals! You suck me, Barry Animal Hospital. Karen. I'm such a good person. I helped that buxom old man. I can't wait to tell his story on "Jack Talk." I really do feel like Oprah. Thank you, Jack. I feel alive for the first time. Good for you, good for you!   
                




                    			This is so exciting, being in L.A. I already feel like I'm tanner, thinner, and that I have to hide my homosexuality to be cast as a leading man. Hey, look, all the people in this hotel are looking at me. They probably think I'm someone super famous checking in. - Excuse me. Are you-- - Nicole Kidman? No. I was going to say Kathy Griffin. I'll take it. Elliot, hold those bags a little higher. When we were walking by the gutter you almost hit Colin Farrell in the head. Elliot, you must be so excited. I can't believe you might be going to UCLA. I just seems like yesterday you were playing with a GI Joe doll and spilling you juice box on our rug. That was yesterday. And it was Jack. No, but it's so cool of you and Will to come check out UCLA with us. Of course, Elliot. I mean, we wouldn't miss it. You're family. You wanna come next month when we check out University of Kansas? Oh, God no. What celebrities live there? Truman and Adler checking in. Move it. Me first. Hello, Mr. I Moved Here To Become An Actor, Failed, And Then Decided Working In A Hotel Is Really What I Wanted To Do After All. Karen Walker checking in. I reserved the entire eighth floor and bungalow two. I'm like doggie. I can't poo in my own cage. The bellman will see you upstairs. Jack, you think we could go up to the room? I wanna be early for our campus tour. Yeah, you're gonna love our room. I requested a view of the Hollywood hills. So if it rains, we can watch all the houses slide down the hill. Thank you. All right, let's go. My God. That looked like James. Remember? The- That guy that I met the night of The Sound of Music sing-along? Will, you've got to stop. You've thought you've seen this James guy, like, ten times in the last month. He was not in line at Dean and DeLuca. He was not our pilot who flew us out here. And he was definitely not cured of blindness on that Christian station. I know. It's just I wish I got his last name or his phone number. I've been back to that theater, like six times hoping to run into him again. I actually had to buy a ticket to Big Momma's House 2. Had to? You've been quoting lines from that movie all week. "Momma's gonna dole out some justice up in here!" Are our rooms next to each other? Yes, they are. Can they not be? Will? James? Oh, my God. It is you! Hey. Wow, this is so bizarre. What are you doing out here? I'm on vacation. What are you doing here? I'm working. I'm a photographer. You wanna go get a drink? Yeah. I can't-- This is so weird. I swear for the last month, I've been seeing you everywhere. Me, too. I actually thought I saw you at Williams Sonoma trying on bunny rabbit oven mitts. Heh-heh That was me. WILL AND GRACE I Love L. Gay - S08 E014 Syncro: ovidurex Karen? Have you seen Elliot? I'm worried sick. He went out to a party last night with some kids he met on the campus tour and stayed out all night. Honey, that's not good. Well, I can tell you he wasn't at the Phi Theta Mu house. Fun party. More like the "I Felta Thigh" house. I did a beer bong and cuddled with a girl named Lindsay. Hey, guys. Oh, Elliot! Where were you? I wanna know exactly where you were last night. I went to a party with some people and did some stuff. Oh, okay. Now that I know the details, I feel so much better. I'm gonna go crash. Honey, what the hell was that? Oh, you saw that? I had to pull my pants out of my butt a little bit. No. Elliot owes you an explanation. Jackie, you're his father. You've got to start acting like one. Well, it's hard. It's a very complicated relationship between a sperm donor dad and the child of a lesbian who shows up on his door 13 years later. There's really only one book about it. And not a lot of stores carry Yank, Squirt, Doink, Dyke, Baby. I know, honey. All I'm saying is that Elliot's going to be going away to college next year. Soon he won't be around for you to protect him. And help him to make the right choices. So, now while you go talk to him, I'm gonna run back to the Phi Theta Mu house and teach Lindsay that you only have to use condoms if he's ugly. Look at that couple. The one guy is so much cuter than the other guy. Mis-match. - Look, they're pointing at us too. - Stop looking at them. So, you wanna, wanna go in the pool? Oh, can I put my ring in your shoe? I don't know what that entails, but sure. I'm game. My engagement ring. Oh! I'm sorry, your engagement what? It's for my green card. I'm Canadian and my friend Claire offered to marry me so that I could stay in the country. Oh, that is so sweet. My friend Grace won't even flush the toilet. All right, come on, let's get in. You know what? I'll be in there in a second. I got a bit of a cramp. There you are! Thank you. Thank you for making me go to Grauman's Chinese Theater all by myself. I looked like an idiot standing in John Wayne's footprints alone. Because your feet are bigger? And my hands. Was he tiny, or am I just a monster? The reason that I blew you off, remember that guy that I thought was James in the lobby? It was him. And he is amazing. Where is he? Introduce me. Yeah, maybe later. What's the matter? You think I'm gonna turn him? Turn him? He's already gay. No, I just wanna have him to myself for a while. You understand, right? What's the big deal? You just met him, like, two days ago. Don't you see? We meet in New York, and a month later we meet in LA. It's fate. No, fate is me signing Kathy Griffin autographs for ten bucks a pop and running into her doing the same thing. I'm serious. I think this is the beginning of something. Oh, Will, it sounds like you're moving a little fast. I know what I'm doing. Hurry up, get out of here. He's getting out of the pool. All right, fine. I'll go. - Is that him? - Yeah. Mis-match. I had such a good time last night. I tried sushi. I climbed on this roof and chipped my tooth on a satellite dish. Then I did a beer bong and cuddled with a girl named Lindsay. We really need to talk about last night. Oh, I'm sorry, Jack. I can't. And I also can't go to the beach with you later. Some of the guys called, and they want to hang out. Well, just as second. You should have called me. I was up all night watching Telemundo and worrying myself sick. Hey, I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go. No, no, no. You can't. What? You've behaved irresponsibly, so you're grounded. That's funny. See ya later. I'm not kidding. I am not spending another night watching Spanish soap operas wondering where my son is! Now, you are going to sit here and think about what you are wearing tomorrow. You're not the guy who tells me what to do. Yes, I am. I am your father, and if I say you're not going, you're not going. My father? All you did was donate sperm. You're not Dad. You're Jack. - Elliot-- - I'm going out. Elliot! Que lastimo mi nino I just realized I do know your work. You took that photograph, that amazing shot of Kate Moss in the dumpster with the lettuce leaf on her head. That was genius. I can't take credit. I found her like that. Mr. Hanson? You have a phone call at the front desk. Get that. I'll order us drinks. Mis-match. Excuse me. That was Kathy Griffin I saw you with. Could you get me her autograph? Sure. It's ten bucks. Eh, it's for my niece. I'll do it myself. Hey. Everything okay? Actually, no. That was Claire. Apparently she me somebody and now she doesn't want to marry me. I don't get it. She's not pretty, smart, or funny. I really thought this was a fool-proof plan. So, what does this mean? It means I have to leave the country. Oh? When-- When do you have to go? My visa expires in four days. Crap. So I did those push-ups for nothing. Thanks a lot, Karen. I took your advice and tried to be a dad to Elliot. And we ended up having a huge fight. He said I wasn't really his father and he stormed off. Oh! Oh, honey, he didn't mean it. Mason and Olivia say the most horrible things about me. And sometimes to the police. [SIGHS] No, he did mean it. Maybe he's right. I'm not his father. Listen. Every parent goes through this. When I lost Mason in Egypt for four weeks, I'll be honest. I doubted myself. I didn't think there was any way he would ever again think that I was a good mother. When he rang our doorbell that day, covered in stickers All was forgiven. Jack, trust me. You're a good father. You can ring my bell Honey, what's that? It's my cell phone. Ding-a-ling-a-ling, my bell Cool ring tune, honey. Thanks, I miss a lot of calls 'cause I like to get all the way to the ding-a-ling-a-lings. You can ring my bell Ring my bell, my bell Oh! It's Elliot. Oh, it's Elliot. Hello? Elliot? Hello? Oh. Yeah. Just a second. He wants to talk to you. What can I do you for, Smelliot? Okay. Bye. He's stranded and needs a ride. Oh, well, where's he at? I'll go get him. Honey, he wants me to go. I'm sorry, Jackie. I feel awful. Me, too. You can ring my bell ring my bell, my bell Oh, my God. You've gotta come downstairs and see this. Tara Reid dropped her martini in the pool and now she's drinking the water. Come on. - Are you packing? - Yes. For real, or are you having fun? Do I look like I'm having fun? Kinda. Well, that's because I'm using my shirt board and that always makes me a little happy. I'm going home, Grace. James green card marriage fell through, and now he has to go back to Canada. Oh, how awful for him. Those Canadians are so smug, with their health care and their gay rights. It's easy to be like that when you're not a real country. Did you hear what I said? James and I are over. God. The one time that I don't over-think something. The one time that I take a chance, and this is what happens. Will, I'm sorry, but it was gonna end anyway. I mean, that that's what happens with flings. This was not a fling. Will, I am sure that James is a really great guy. But you've only known him a couple of days. And you're on vacation. Maybe you just got caught up a little. Grace, you know me. I don't get caught up. I'm like the one gay man I know that never got highlights. I mean, I cover the grey. I'm not a caveman. You know, I mean, maybe we could have had something. You know, and now now we'll never have a chance to find out. Does he feel the same way? Yes. I think. I mean, how could he not. See, you don't even know. Why don't you just slow down, enjoy the next two days and then see where you are. I can't. I don't want to go any further down a dead end road. Ugh. There you are! I got lost and had to stop at a bar for directions. I couldn't understand one thing anybody said. The gay accent is so thick here. Well, what are you doing here? I thought Karen was coming. Well, you got me whether you want me or not, Elliot. So, come on. No, I-- I do want you. I only called Karen because I didn't think you'd come after all the things I said. Elliot, if you need me, I'll always come and get you. It doesn't matter what awful things you say to me, or how long you insist on keeping that Keira Knightly haircut. You're my son. Now, tell me exactly what happened tonight. These guys, they wanted me to go to the ATM to get money so we can get beer, and uh. After I gave it to them, they just drove off, laughing and flipping me off. I'm starting to think I got ditched. I once got ditched, too. I was in high school and it involved an actual ditch. I'd still be there if that police dog hadn't picked up my scent. All part of growing up. Let's go. Wait. Jack. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said you weren't my dad. Anyway. Isn't it weird that all of this happened right when you were about to go to college, and you don't even need a dad anymore. Well, maybe I still kinda do. Yeah, we can't hug here. We're on the corner of Murder and Homophobia. So, we'll be checking out early. Oh, and just so you know, I had a break-in. They cleared out the mini-bar. They didn't take the fruit or that other half of that weird granola thing. That's strange. Oh, and, um, also another thing you should also know, is that, um, there was no coffee machine when I checked in. Do you mind if I sit? No, go ahead. Wow, you really are handsome. I'm sorry, I should tell you that I'm gay. Oh, yeah. I got that. You're reading Gourmet Magazine and ripping out recipes. Um, look-- I don't mean to sound rude, but I don't really feel like talking right now. Oh, I see. I mean, what am I gonna say, you know? I can't be all broken-hearted over a guy I've known for two days. Even if he is great. I mean, I have to-- I'm sorry. I'm taking up all your time, and clearly you've got money to make, so Wait. You think I'm a hooker? I'll take that. It's just that it sucks, you know. I thought that this could really be something. And now I'm not gonna get a chance to find out. Well, what if was only meant to be a fun weekend. How much do you even know about him? Well, uh I know his favorite color is antique paper. And that he calls his shirt board Flatimir. He knows all the lyrics to "Walking on Sunshine," which is a bummer, but I can get over it. That's how much I like him. I mean, I haven't met a guy like that in so long who seemed honest and real and kind He is. And he feels the same way about you. I'm Grace, by the way. Oh. Will told me you were funny. Oh, that's sweet. That's why I didn't think it was you. Well, if it makes you feel any better, Will's pretty miserable, too. He's upstairs packing. For real or for fun? For real. What are you doing? Checking out. I was gonna come say goodbye after I finished making the bed. You make your hotel bed, too? So do I. It just got harder to leave you. You guys, I have something to say. This is not a good time, Grace. Yeah, but, what if-- Please, I'm trying to say goodbye here. I don't wanna say goodbye. Well, I don't wanna say it either, but I don't see what else there is to do. I do. What if I-- Wh-Wh-- What if you what, Grace? What are you gonna do that will magically solve this miserable and hopeless situation? What if I marry James? Yeah, that will solve it. You're not serious. No, no, Grace, that's crazy. Why? I mean, you guys clearly have something here. You deserve to see where this relationship could go. Are you sure? It's only two years. What have I done in the last two years? I can't think of one thing. That's true. She didn't even read The DaVinci Code. So, what do you say, James? Will you marry me? Yes, yes, I will. - May I kiss the bride? - Yes. Mis-match!   
                




                    			Okay. Everything's all set for the wedding. Coffee, please. We're meeting the justice of the peace at the court house at 4:15, so I've arranged for a car to pick us up at 3:45, okay? And I laid a dress out for you on your bed. Oh, and I also changed your sheets, because I didn't want to lay the dress down on what appeared to be the better part of a Denver omelette. Will, calm down. It's a green card wedding. I don't need to brush my teeth, fix my hair, or put on lipstick. Hell, I don't even need a head. Grace. If you're having second thoughts about this, it is not too late to call it off. You know I'll understand. Me too. Even though if you do back out, I'll be deported back to Canada and my life will be destroyed. Have you ever been to Canada? It's like Michigan without any culture. I'm not backing out! I'm really looking forward to this. If for no other reason than to send a holiday photo of James and me to my mom. - Well, look I just want to say - I know-- - Yeah, but I need-- - I think it's sweet of you-- - So you know? - I do. I'm glad I got a chance to say it to you. Oh, there they are. The Jewish woman and the black man who are about to get married. I get such a kick that that's legal. So, James. You didn't show up at your bachelor party last night. Wait. What bachelor party? Jack offered to throw me a bachelor party for the two of us. Me and him. I don't know how you missed it. My invitation was very clear. "What: Bachelor Party. Where: My Place. When: After Will Falls Asleep." Honey, I made some arrangements for your wedding today. I've reserved St. Patrick's Cathedral. I know you're Jewish, but I couldn't find a bank or deli on such short notice. WILL AND GRACE The Definition of Marriage - S08 E015 Syncro: ovidurex What the Surprise! Smile! Whoa. You're not gonna like that one. What's going on? A surprise wedding! Since we couldn't do St. Patrick's because of the funaway bride here-- Okay. I just came up with that just now. See, it's clever because there's a movie called Runaway Bride and she took the fun away from planning the wedding. So I called it "funaway bride"! Instead of runaway bride! Runaway Bride's the real title! This is the first time I thought I could actually kill her. Well, look at this. All my friends together in one room. And Rosario. Hey. Karen, I told you that I didn't want to make a big deal about this. Oh, my God. Why do I smell Polident and cabbage? BOBBI: Hello, dear! I hear you're marrying a gay, black man. Wouldn't have it been easier to just run me over? Hi, mom. Your wigs on backwards. BOBBI: Oh! I really need to draw an arrow inside it. Excuse us. Did you know about this? Of course not! I would never let them invite your mother. Hell, if I'd been planning this, I wouldn't have invited a single person in there. We can hear you! You didn't let me finish. Except for Larry. I think I patched that up. So, look. I don't want to do this either. So why don't we just go inside and tell them that we want a simple thing at the Justice of the Peace? Hey, guys. Or we march my very hot boyfriend into that apartment and show him off to all of my friends? Sorry I'm so dressed up, Grace. But Karen can be very persuasive when you're in the tub and she's there with a toaster and a garment bag. Hey, kids. Everything okay? No, it's not okay. What did you do? I didn't do anything. I'm against this whole charade. Did I pronounce that correctly? A-gainst. Yep. Honey, you've gotta make the wedding look real for the INS. Now, come on. I got you a dress and a ring. And Rosario's gonna take some pictures. Believe me, she's better behind the camera than in front of it. Ugh. All this for a pretend wedding. I'm not even getting laid at the end? Am I? - No. - Let him answer! JOE: I have to say Will, when I heard James was Canadian, I though "yechh." But I didn't know they made them like that. Yeah. I'm glad you guys like him. Like him? I'd sell my mother to a cult just to see him take off his shirt. And Grace gets to marry him. Heh. I hate her. Well, you know, James isn't just good looking. He's also charming and smart-- And could pound me like a piece of veal. What? You guys where thinking it. - I was. - I am now. You know, you didn't hear it from me, but, uh, Will is going bald. It's not going to be pretty. Look at my head. - May I kiss it? - No. Well, what's going on here? Yeah, um, I don't see this working. Okay? There. I said it. I didn't want to say it. But now I've said it. I don't see this working. If he comes too close again, blow this whistle. I know we wanted to do a simple thing at the courthouse, but this is kind of fun. This is exactly the way I'd do my wedding, you know? Only Stevie Wonder would be here to sing my favorite song. "Superstitious"? Why? Is it bad luck to have a blind guy sing at your wedding? No, the song. No, no. He'd sing "As". You know, I won a lip sync contest at my high school doing a Stevie Wonder medley that ended with "Ebony and Ivory." My performance really brought everybody together. Kids of all races beat me up. Excuse me? Is this the Adler and Hanson wedding? Yes. Are you Hall and Oates? Actually, it's Oates and Hall now. Yeah. Every 25 years we flip it. Uh, when I agreed to that, I didn't think we'd last that long. God, it is so weird seeing myself in a wedding dress again. It's freaking me out a little bit. I'm actually sweating. Honey, you're finally wearing a quality fabric. Your body's not sweating, it's crying with relief. It is an incredible dress. Thank you so much for doing this. It probably is better that it look real for the INS. That's not the only reason that I'm doing all this, honey. I think what you're doing for Will is the most generous thing I've seen one friend do for another. And it made me want to be generous to you. I'm just really proud of you, Gracie. I just got sick to my stomach. Yeah, well, screw you! I was just making conversation, you ungrateful bitch! No! No, Karen, come back. Come back. It's not what you said. I think it's just, uh, because I'm squeezed into a size two. - It's an eight. - Four. - Six. - I'll take it. Hey, the justice of the peace is here. My God, you look incredible. Well, thank you, Will. You're not looking too bad yourself. I was talking to Grace. Yeah, well, screw you, you ungrateful bitch! Okay. Sweetie, if you're ready? Let's go marry my boyfriend. Yeah, just give me-- Just give me one second. Ever since I put this dress on, I've been feeling a little sick. Wait a minute. You really not feel well? Or is it just having a wedding dress on again is bringing up all sorts of Leo stuff? I don't know. Maybe a little bit. But, I still want to do this. So, get out there. I'll be there in a sec. Oh, quick question, Karen. Did you hire Hall and Oates for this wedding? Yes, I did. And I was lucky to get them. Honey, that's one of the most successful acts in the history of pop music. Oh, and after the service, Oates will do your caricature for a dollar. Look. Anything you need-- Jack! All right. [TO HALL AND OATES] All right. The second she walks down that aisle, I want to hear music. And I don't want to hear a track from your last album. This is a wedding, not the Ellen show. Okay, I understand, I understand. [QUIETLY] Listen. Let me ask you something. Did we sleep together in Dayton, Ohio in 1981? Maybe. Were you in the pile with Chrissie Hynde and Joan Jett? Okay, I'm ready. Let's do it. Grace, may I walk you down the aisle? That's so sweet. Here she comes. Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up. Here she comes. She's a maneater. Funny. Who knew Hall and Oates were such a riot. Okay. Let's do it again. This time, put down those guitars and just hum "The Wedding March". That way you can still walk around and refill drinks. Hit it. I can't believe she gets to wear that beautiful dress. I kind of want to trip her. What? You were both thinking it. - I was. - I am now. Now it's time for your vows, which I was told you prepared yourselves? Oh. No. We're not doing that. Right. And you can just skip the whole "kiss your bride" thing, too. No, that we're doing. I wanna hear vows. I payed 500 large for this shindig. Brown sugar goes first. Karen, I have asked you not to call him that. It's offensive. And it makes a little less special when I do it. Okay, uh, Grace I love your hair. It's a kind of red that you really don't see that often, outside the Raggedy family. Well, he's quick on his feet. I don't know what I would have said. James. I vow to stand by you, or whatever. And I, uh, vow to, um Wow, I just got dizzy. Okay, just got a little barfy. So beautiful. Oh, my God, I'm crying Are you okay? Can we get some water here? Thanks, Oates. Here. No, I'm-- I'm okay. I don't even know what happen-- - Grace-- - I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just a little hot in here, or something. Okay, let's just keep going. No, no, no. We're not doing this. I'm sorry, James. We need to talk. Come here. Oof. Not her day. How dare you drag me out of my wedding! I wanted everything to be perfect! I'm totally kidding. What's up? "What's up"? You just fainted. I didn't faint. I barely Lindsay Lohan'd. I don't think you want to marry James. What? Of course I do. I know you say you're okay with it, but look at you. You're falling apart. I mean, maybe your body's trying to tell you that you're really not okay with this. Will, my body's not that smart. If it were, it would have stopped my feet from growing at age twelve and would have focused all of its energy right up here. It's the dress. It's-- It's too tight. I swear I wanna do this. I just wanna make sure you've thought this through. Because after today, that's it. You're married. Um, maybe you haven't noticed, but there hasn't been a lot going on with me lately. No, no, I've noticed. And what if you meet someone? I don't want my relationship with James to be the thing that stops you. It's two years. And I get a gorgeous husband who doesn't care if I cheat on him? A girl could do worse. So, you're sure? I'm sure. 'Cause you're the most important person in the world to me and if there is anything that I can do to help ensure your happiness, I'm gonna do it. What did I do to deserve you? A million things. And you're gonna do a million more to keep deserving me. This is going to be a really expensive two years for me, isn't it? Oh, yeah. Hey. Tall and Oates. I'm not paying you two to stand around. I guess I should have hired Men at Work. Maybe you should get in there and pick up some dirty plates. HALL: I can't go for that. No can do. OATES: Whoops. Now you got to put a dollar in the "Old Lyric Jar." HALL: You and that jar. Sometimes I think we're never gonna have that pizza party. Excuse me. You guys know Will pretty well, don't you? Should I be worried? Oh, no. No, Will and Grace do this all the time. They're always crawling off into rooms to whisper, or fight, or God knows what. That's a relief. Sorry for freaking out on you guys like that. JOE: That was freaking out? I don't know. Karen gave me what she swore was a mint, but she shook it out of an envelope and now I can't feel my tongue. Anyway, thanks. It's nice to not be the only black guy in the room. I figured you out. You hate Canada. You do. You hate Canada so much that you're willing to marry Grace and pretend to be in love with fat, bald Will so you don't have to go back to that awful frozen prison where Superman lives. You know, I used to think that you were jealous of Will, but now I'm beginning to think that you're jealous of me for getting to be with Will. Well played, Canada. Well played. But you're wrong! This has all been a test to see if your feelings for my best friends are really true. And you passed. This time. But know this! I will always be coming on to you. Always. When you turn a corner, I'll be there. Nude. To test you. Did I mention you're allowed to fail one test. Will, he has earned you. Take good care of him. And remember nude. Did Jack just threaten to be nude around the corner. It's hard to be threatened by a guy who still writes "L" and "R" on the bottom of his shoes. He took my whistle, Will. Oh, sweetie, come here. It's so crazy today. I just wish we could get a little time alone. Yeah. HALL AND OATES: Private eyes. They're watching you. They see your every move Oh, grow up, Hall and Oates! Okay. I'm ready. BOBBI: Oh, dear, are you alright? Oh, your make-up is so thick, I can't get a read. At least mine doesn't come off in one piece. Whoo! The wedding zinger! Okay. See what I did? The movie is called The Wedding Singer, but Grace made a joke and I changed it from The Wedding Singer to The Wedding Zinger! So darned clever. All I did was literally change one letter. Let's go, James. The quicker we do this, the quicker I get out of my dress. - It's a size two. - I heard it was an eight. - You want me to do this? - Okay. Grace, you look so radiant. Turn around. Wow. It looks like I'm going to be in Photoshop all night. Well, all right then. Do you, Grace-- I sure do. Do you, James Allen-- Can you just hold off for a second. I mean, I do, but let me just do this quick thing. I know this is supposed to be our day, but I just want to do something for our best man, since I didn't have time to buy him any cufflinks. As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving Stevie Wonder. And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May As hate knows loves the cure, You can rest your mind assure, that I'll be loving you always. Oh, yeah. I'm-a test you. As rocky as that wedding started out, it turned out to be pretty great. My favorite part? When you sang Stevie Wonder to me. I sang Stevie Wonder? Yeah. You sang "As". Wow. Karen's pills were amazing. You don't remember singing it? I don't even know that song. Hey, Will. Hey, Grace. I love your hair like that. Karen, silly, that's not Grace. That's James, Grace's other gay husband. - Tempted? - No. What if I hadn't just eaten herring? There you are. Where did you get off to so early? Oh, I, uh, I still wasn't feeling well this morning, so I went to the doctor. Oh, sweetie, you are sick. No, I'm not sick. I'm pregnant. To be continued   
                




                    			Oh, my God. Pregnant? That's-- That's whatever you think that is, I think that is, too. You dog. Grace, you're going to have a Jewish black baby. I believe that's called a macaroon. It's not James's baby. It's Leo's. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I think you dodged a bullet, because there's serious alcoholism in my family. Leo? But-- When you had sex in the plane? You told me you were safe. Oh, I thought you meant did we have our seat belts on. Shall I sing to your belly? I'm hazy as to why I would do this. But I distinctly recall those sort of shenanigans on the last season of "Mad About You." Her baby takes the morning train. It works from nine to five, and then Wow. Grace's baby already works more than you do. Now come on. Now, Grace. You say this man was called Leo. Did you get a last name? I'm taking a nap. I might be out for a while. Wake me if you hear a baby crying. Ugh. This line. I want to get home before Grace wakes up. Unbelievable. This woman is paying for a 55-cent cookie with a check. Oh, and look at that. They don't accept checks. But lucky for us, she has a thousand pennies in a baggie! Relax. Relax, baby. When you tense up like that I can see what you're going to look like when you're old. All right, come on. I think I know of a way we can get out of here fast. Excuse me, could we just get two coffees and two muffins? WOMAN: And I'm just getting a cookie, so wait your turn. Um, I'm sorry, it's just that, uh, my mother-- she's dying. And I was just sitting by her bedside feeling helpless, when she told me to get a muffin, I jumped at the opportunity to finally do something. WOMAN: Your mother's dying? Yeah, I think we've run out of miracles. Hey, guys. Is Grace up? No. Mile-high mom is still sleeping. Hey, what's in the bag, fag? Oh. Muffins from James. Do you think it's weird that he got them by cutting in line, and then lying about need them for his dying mother? No, not at all, honey. I mean, that's the same way we used to get bread and juice during the great depre-- Eighties. Clever idea. Much better than the scam I usually use. I have this neighbor who never locks his door. I just sneak in when he's showering and fill up my therm-- Eighties. So you don't think it's creepy? No, honey. As a matter of fact, he probably just did it so you could get back here to Grace. Well, that's true. I just haven't seen that side of him before. Of course, I've only known him for five days. I like that he's edgy. Because I'm edgy, too. You know, like sometimes when I throw gum into a public trash can and it sticks to the side? I just keep on walking. N.M.P. Not my problem. Man that was a really good nap. What'd I miss? Tuesday. You've been out for, like, twenty hours. No wonder I'm hungry. I've missed, like, seven meals. Well, you are eating for two. Eating for two? Why would you say that I'm eating for two? Ah! I'm pregnant! I totally forgot. I'm going to be an unwed mother. No, you're not. You married James two days ago. Ahh! I'm married! I totally forgot. Honey, if you think that's upsetting, check this out. Yeah, I thought we could get three. Listen, Grace. This seems as good a time as any to ask for a little favor. Uh, the ratings for "JackTalk" have been slipping. Which is why I need to do something bigger, bolder, more derivative. So, I would like you to give birth, live on my talk show! How exciting would that be? I picture you shooting it out into a rainbow flag dog bed. Get him out of here. Well, you didn't let me finish. There's a dog in it. God, this is so overwhelming. Please. Someone tell me what to do first. Well Have you called Leo yet to tell him he's going to be a dad? Yeah. Right after I got out of the doctor's office. His machine said that he was of the country. I don't even know where he is, or when he's coming back. Oh, Grace. Honey, I'm so sorry. Is this Leo a flight attendant? Karen. Leo is a doctor. He works for Doctors Without Borders. Oh! Leo! Honey, I'm sorry. Oh, my God! I feel so stupid. Leo, of course. Leo. I can see him perfectly now. God, what's that gonna look like? Well, then maybe we should try to track him down. Doctors Without Borders will know where he is. Oh, Will, now you leave her alone. She doesn't have to call him right now. In fact, she doesn't have to call him at all. You can come live with me, Grace. Honey, I could be your baby daddy! Okay? Okay, so it's all set. Great. Listen. I'm just gonna run out and buy a little, teeny, tiny, silver spoon. And then right after that, I'm gonna go shopping for the baby. Okay. If she offers to powder baby, say no. You know what? I am gonna leave my cell phone number on Leo's machine. That way, he'll always have another place to find you. Put the phone down. WILL: No, it'll just take a second. Will, please put it down. Why? Because he's home, okay? I checked with his hospital. He just got back to New York. I don't understand. What-- What's going on? Are you not going to tell him? Of course I am, butt wipe! What? Oh, I'm sorry. Hormone surge. It was the baby talking. Well, it has its mother's charm. Look, I know I have to tell him. It's just that it's-- It's hard. I mean, I've pushed him away so many times, and what, now I'm gonna show up and say, "Guess what? You're gonna be a father." I mean, I don't want him coming back just because I'm having a baby. Oh, my God, but you do want him back. Of course I do, you pile! Who are you giving birth to? Rosanne? Sorry. Will, this is just this is just so crazy. I mean when I found out I was pregnant with Leo's baby, I-- I felt a million things, but the first thing I felt was happy. You know how happy he's gonna be to hear you say that? He will, won't he? Oh, my God You're gonna have Leo back And I've got James Could we actually have everything? I think we might. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I am. Let's call our friends and rub it in their faces! So things are really working out for you two, huh? Grace is having a baby and going to get her hubby back. You've got Seal. Everybody's got something but me. What are you talking about? You're worth 740 million dollars. You-you've got a husband who adores you. And you have the dark gift of eternal life. I hope I picked the right thing to wear. I'm going for the love of your life whose not trapping you into marriage with a surprise pregnancy look. God, I remember the first year that look hit the runways. I thought, "Who's going to wear that?" Hi, Grace. Listen. Glad I caught you. So excited about the baby. Now, do a gay brother a solid. Swallow this tiny camera. It's for a new segment on "JackTalk" I'm going to call "Let's Meet Us the Fetus" Um, Jack. The baby is not in my digestive system. Okay. But if it were this is the race car from a Monopoly game. Well, the real camera is bigger than this. We gotta start small and widen your throat. Oh, Jack! I feel a kick. So far, I do not like that baby. But your boyfriend on the other hand, is not only easy on the eyes, he is H-I-lari-O-U-S! Why? What'd he do? Okay. As we were leaving the gym, it was pouring rain and there were no cabs anywhere. Okay. And there was this nurse standing outside the hospital who'd obviously been waiting quite a while. Yeah, and? And so this cab pulls up and James yanks me right past her, and as we get in, James turns to me and he says-- Wait. You stole a cab from a nurse? Yeah. In the rain. Anyways-- Anyways James made the funniest joke. This is so funny, I'm already laughing and I don't even know what it is! That is so James! I know, right! Right? She was mad! She was shaking that crutch at us as we drove away! Anyway. So James says-- "Please share our cab with us, wet, disabled nurse?" No, no, no. James says-- Oh, now, I can't remember. Let me start over. Your boyfriend is H-I-lari-O-U-- Yeah, yeah, alright, yeah, yeah. I'm having lunch with James. He can tell me the story. I'm sure you told it wrong anyway. After all, you are the person who thought Dick Cheney was a bondage toy. So I had a really fun time with Jack before. Oh, did he tell you? The funniest thing happened to us. Oh. I'm glad you brought this up. Because, yes, he did tell me the story, but I'm sure he got it wrong. Let me you, because it was hilarious. Okay, I'm dying to hear it. Anyway, we, uh, we're coming out of the gym. Oh, man this is really funny. Tell me, tell me. It's pouring down rain, okay? And we can't find a cab anywhere. And there's this nurse-- So this cab pulls up And I mean, it's coming down in buckets, right? Lot of rain. Got it. And then there's little nursey, okay? Oh, God So Then we run past her, hop in the cab-- I'm sorry! Every time I think about it, it gets me going again. My stomach! Ooh. Did I tell you she had an eye patch? Stop the story! Ha! What's the matter? Well, I'm sorry, but I think I'm missing something in the obviously delightful tale of the wet, limping, underpaid health care worker who gets pushed out of the way by two healthy young men with umbrellas. No. No, I'm sorry. My friends tell me I have wicked sense of humor. It drove my ex-boyfriend crazy. You've never mentioned an ex-boyfriend. Good, good. That's a good change of topic. Let's talk about that. Okay. Uh, well, Curtis and I were together about three years. He was funny, handsome a lot like you. Uh, but then he got in a terrible skiing accident, was in the hospital for about a year. God, that's awful. Must have been an incredible strain on your relationship. Oh, not for me. I was out of there in the first week. Who wants to deal with that? Hi. Listen. I'm sorry I'm late. I crossed the international date line on the way here, so I thought we already had this meeting. You look good. Oh, you look good, too. I heard you just got back into the country. So, I, um I have Let me make this easier for both of us I think I know why you wanted to meet me. You do? Yeah. You heard about Kate. Right. Kate. I've been meaning to call you. I even wrote, like, three drafts of a letter, you know? I just didn't know how to tell you. How do you tell your ex-wife you're getting re-married? You're getting remarried. You knew, right? Oh, yes. I-- Yeah. Uh-huh. I just, um I guess it just feels a little weird hearing it, you know, right from you. I know. I know. It feels weird for me, too. I mean, when we saw each other in London, you know, I was thinking maybe there's a chance that you and I could you know But you said you were gonna move on with your life, and that I should too. Yes, yes. I I did I said that. I really-- I didn't think I could ever fall in love with anyone else, and then I met Kate. I love her. She's great. You're really gonna like her, too. Yay. I am so glad that you found someone, Leo. That's all I wanted to say. I just wanted to say it in person, that's all. That means so much to me. Well, it was great to see you. God, Grace, I thought this was gonna be so awkward, and it totally wasn't. No. No. No, not at all. Bye, Leo. Bye, Grace. Bye. [QUIETLY] Is Grace home yet? Not yet. What you got there, honey? Well, you know I tried to work with Grace. I asked her nicely to swallow a camera. And she said no. So, if she's not gonna share that baby with me willingly, I'm going to have to resort to trickery capture her pregnancy for "JackTalk". I've hidden inside this horse, a state of the art camera and microphone. Can you tell? Honey, I can't even see the horse. Hello, Willard. How was lunch with James? Good. Interesting. We had French food, which I didn't even know he likes. But then again we just met, so there's a lot of things we don't know about each other. Like, for instance, up until yesterday, he didn't know I'd never been to Vancouver, and I didn't know that he'd fake his mother's death just to avoid waiting in line for coffee. Oh, another new discovery I hate cilantro, he hates the handicapped. I shouldn't say "hate". Hate's a strong word. Abandons. He abandons the handicapped. Again, learning. And what I'm learning is that I never want to see him again, because every new bone-chilling discovery I make about the man makes me want to trade him in for credit at the Hot Canadian Freak Store! Hi. Hey. How'd it go with Leo? Oh, um, he He met somebody. He's he's, uh, engaged. Oh, God. What did he say about the baby? Oh, I didn't tell him. I mean, I-- I will. But it's you know just I just couldn't. Not then. Not not right after he told me he was getting married. Sweetie, I'm so sorry. It was crazy to think that all of a sudden we could just have a happy family. Honey, you do have a family. And I don't mean those Jews in Schenectady. I mean us. That's right. We're in this together. Whatever you need, we are there for you. It's true, Grace. We'll be right by your side every step of the way. Thanks, Jack. Day one. Devastation. Sign here, and here, and your marriage to James is officially annulled. You're sure you want me to do this? Okay. He lied about his mother's death for muffins. He abandoned his physically disabled boyfriend. But, seriously. You are never gonna get a hotter guy than that. He also said, "How are we gonna shake the knocked-up red head?" Back to Canada, baldie.   
                




                    			Grace? You awake? Grace! I'm up. Turn off the bacon alarm. It's amazing. You know, you go to bed looking like Courteney Cox, and you wake up Courtney Love. Just serve the bacon, jackass. And we're officially my parents. I'm sorry, I got no sleep last night. I have three apartments to do by the end of the month. Normally, I would do the same design three times in a row, but the old bags know each other. It's so much work. I think I'm going to have to hire another assistant for a while. And Karen's got her hands full carving penises into her desk and getting her real estate license online. That would explan why she tried to get me to buy a condo in the Poconos. It would also explain this penis. Look at me! I'm glowing. Congratulations, Jack. Are you gonna find out the gender, or do you wanna be surprised? I'm not pregnant, I'm in love. Aw, Jack. That's great. Are you gonna find out the gender, or do you wanna be surprised? Oh, Grace, if I wasn't so happy, I might say something hateful. Like, bacon isn't love. So, tell us about your new boyfriend. How many hours have you been going out? Seventeen. His name is Travis, and he's the hottest guy I've ever gone out with. He's very into the downtown gay country two-step cowboy rodeo bar scene. Sometimes I think you guys are just too creative. Why can't you just be gay, and leave it at that. Listen, without all this, we're just guys who can't throw balls. Will, come out with us Friday. I'm dying for you to meet Travis. Alright. But I hate those gay theme bars. You know, and they always have such awful names. Oh, no, no, no. The Cow Poke's not like that at all. Well, you seem really, really qualified. I'll be in touch. Thanks, I'll look forward to hearing from you. Um, could I have my purse? Oh! Sure, honey. Condoms, but no breath mints. I like a gal that cuts to the chase. Huh? So far, she's the one to beat. Although she she might almost be too pretty. Eh, I'll just find a way to get ten pounds on her. Good luck with that. Cupcake? Oh, I'd love one! I'm here for the interview with Grace Adwerk. It's Adler. Are you making fun of my accent? No! No, no. I wouldn't make fun of any accent. Well, except maybe Southern. I'm sorry, I don't care if they are rocket scientists, they still sound dumb. Please come sit. Here, honey, let me take your purse. Somebody likes figs. So Pam. That's a nice name. What were you expecting? Just because I'm Middle Eastern, it should be a long and unpronounceable name? Like Pam [NAME IN FARSI.] Oh, no. Not at all. I wasn't implying it was anything crazy like that. Because that's what it is. Honey, your hair's so short in your driver's license picture. You look a little like Omar Sharif. I don't like you. What an interesting résumé. Wow. I had no idea they had House of Pies in Tehran. Well, everybody likes pie, not just Americans. Oh, of course. I didn't mean to imply that. You are absolutely right. Everybody loves pie. And just because the saying is, "American as apple pie," doesn't mean it can't be "Iranian as apple pie." Or "Bye-bye, Miss Iranian Pie." Bye-bye, Miss Iranian Pie. Drove my Oxcart to the levee, but the levee was dry I'm making you uncomfortable. Clearly you were never going to consider a Middle Eastern woman for this position. No, no, that's not true at all. I'm definitely considering you for this position. Careful. I just wish I saw a little more design experience here. I started to put together a portfolio, but it was difficult with the revolution, the operation, and the line at Kinko's. I'm sorry, I take for granted how many opportunities I've had. You know what?-- Uh, honey, I forgot to tell you that the messenger called. And he said, "I ran your credit card and it's bad!" Can you start tomorrow? Thank you. You won't regret this. I know I won't. Nice purse, honey. It's not made out of camel, if that's what you're implying. I kind of was. Well, I hate to say it, but I think you just made a big mistake. To quote Samuel Jackson in almost any movie I got a bad feelin' about this. Wow. A gay western bar. Where's the mechanical bull dyke? Over there. And no man has ever stayed on her. Oh, there's Travis! Which one? The one in the cowboy hat and tight jeans. - Him? - No. - Him? - No, him! No! He's crazy hot. Okay, calm down, he's mine. And the best part? I really get along with that little doggy. John Wayne would be so proud. To shoot you. Travis! Hey, hey, Jack! Too bad they already played the "Boot Scootin' Boogie." You missed the bootin' scootin', but we can still boogie. And I'm leaving. Wait, wait, wait. Travis, this is my bestie, Will. How ya doin'? Hi. Okay, I'm gonna go get us some drinks, all right? It's so fun being in a gay cowboy bar. Everyone's so rugged! Can we get three lemon drops, please? I love this song. It was playin' when I came out to my wife. And strangely enough, she hates it. It's fun to laugh at an anonymous woman's heartbreak. Hey, Will! While I wait for the drinks, dance with Travis! And don't feel so self-conscious. Heavy bodies always look better in motion. How 'bout it, Will? Why not? How often do I get to dance underneath a disco ball hanging from a wagon wheel. Alright, well, you just follow my lead. Alright? Alright. One, two, quick stop. One, two, quick stop. Yeah, I'm getting it. You sure are. You're on it like spots on an Appaloosa. Tell me, when you go home at night and you take all this off, do you still talk like that? You wanna find out? Excuse me? I think you're hot. And spin! Hey! Princess Jasmine! Showtime! Hello? [SPEAKS FARSI] Uh, okay. A little refresher on the refresher course. Please answer the phone in English. Oh, I forgot. I'm in America. I'm supposed to be ashamed of my cultural heritage. Pam, did you did you fax over the designs to the cabinet maker yet? I'll do it right after my smoke break. I'm sorry. But remember, I told you you can't smoke here. It's a part of my religion. Smoking in the office. So inappropriate! Hey, anyone mind if I take my boob out for a second? Hey! It's one thing at dinner, Karen, but at work, I'd really prefer you keep it in. What? Why is line two blinking? Who's been on hold? Oh, I forgot. It's Mrs. Van Helden. Okay, she's just our most important client. I'm sorry, let me get it. No-- Oh! You just hung up on her! Wow, this is gonna be a real horse race for employee of the week. Hello? Yes, yes. Hi, Mrs. Van Helden. I was-- I was just about to call you. No, no, it's just that-- Well, let me just-- I see. She fired us. Oh, I must go pray for you to get your client back. It's better from an East facing bar. Oh, great. So now she can drink during work, too? Well, to quote Morgan Freeman in almost any movie You should have listened to me, white girl. Okay. Yes, we lost our most important client. And yes, Pam might be partially responsible. For all of it. But what's more important? Making money, or doing the right thing? Money. No, wait. Yeah, money. You know what? You're never going to understand. I mean, the fact is, I'm tolerant. And you are Well, maybe a little bit racist. How dare you call me a racist! A homophobe? Maybe. Distrustful of Spaniards? Who isn't. But nobody calls me a racist. And you can ask anyone I own. Well, well, well If it isn't Karen Walker's little gay friend. Where's your olive-skinned cohort? Don't you homosexuals always travel in pairs? BENJI: Beverley, I'm sorry. They don't have Clay Aiken on the jukebox. Well, look how cute you two are. A black stallion and my little pony. Jack! I need to talk to you. William, what a surprise! I'm just having a drink here with my business associate, Benji. The only surprise is that you're still trying to pass off Benji as your business associate in the middle of a gay bar. This is a gay bar?! Why, I had no idea! I'm-a half a mind to storm out of here right this minute. But my other half wants to stay and finish my refreshing lemon drop. Come here. Travis quite the two-stepper, huh? Yeah. He's also a bit of a two-timer. - What? - Excuse us. When we were on the dance floor, he kind of hit on me. No, he did not. You think everybody hits on you. You blushed when the guy at Starbucks asked if you wanted to leave room for cream. COWBOY: Hey, if you're on the dance floor, get in line! - No, no, no. - Six, seven, eight! Jack, why would I lie to you? I'm your best friend. Because you're jealous. The one-eyed monster reared its ugly head. It's green. I had that once. There's an ointment. But don't try to change the subject! You just can't handle me having the hot guy. Jack, listen to me. The guy is bad news. You don't know what you're talking about! I'm leaving! Look, I can't find my ticket. But I'm sure it's the only John Varvatos cashmere car coat. No, it's not a poncho. No, it doesn't have fringe. No, it's not a poncho with fringe. Nothing with fringe! Uh-oh. Looks look my favorite calf has wandered away from the herd. Let me put this in terms you'll understand. Mooove away from me. Hey, you didn't go say anything to Jack, did you? He's sulking with the lesbians next door at the Big Valley. Of course I told him, because I care about him, which obviously you do not. Excuse me. look, could you take my number please and call me if my coat shows up? How about givin' me your number? You are unbelievable. You know what? I don't find cowboys sexy. I don't even like ranch dressing. Hello? We found your coat. Get out of my way. Whoa, whoa, now why you gettin' all worked up? Alright. Jack won't care. He should be happy he had me this long. Hey, Jack is a catch. No. The guy's a good time, but that's it. Don't say that! Oh, come on. He's an idiot. Shut up! Will, what are you doing? Did you just hit me? Yeah, I did. Your boyfriend here is a jerk. Wait a minute! What's going on here? Gay bar fight! I'm so sorry, Mrs. Van Helden. And I thank you so much for giving me another chance. Look, I'm going to send the designs to you right now. They are already to go at the fax machine. Okay. Take a picture, it would last longer. Pam! Pam, it took me two days to draw up those plans! It took me eighteen years to raise my plane fare to America. Do I yell at you? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I-- Wow. Eighteen years? I'm assuming that's first class. Grace, you seem uncomfortable around me. Is it because I'm Middle Eastern? No, Pam. No, I'm not uncomfortable at all, and I'm happy I'm able to give you this opportunity. And I believe that despite our different backgrounds, that we can work together and help make a more tolerant world. Excuse me. What a beautiful sentiment. I made a similar speech at my Bat Mitzvah. Bat Mitzvah? You're Jewish? Like brisket. Jewish? I can't believe this! This is great! This is wonderful! Okay, why? Because we're both Jewish! I don't have to be tolerant of my own kind. I don't owe you anything! What's your point? You're fired! See you at temple! It's amazing. My first time in a gay bar, and I see my my first gay bar fight. Your first time? You rang the triangle! Well, I better skedaddle. Oh, by the way, I heard what that man said about Jack. You are a true gentleman. If anybody ever called my friend an idiot, I hope I'd be as brave as you. Thank you, Beverley. How about a gentleman's kiss? I'm not that brave. Wow. We were in a gay bar fight. I know. And, oddly, not a single punch was thrown. Hey, sorry I didn't believe you about Travis. I know you wouldn't lie to me. I just wanted to think that a guy like that could choose a guy like me. What does that even mean? Come on, Will. He's kind of out of my league. Hey. Are you kidding? The only reason that you guys are in a different leagues is because he's a creep. You're way above him. You're in a-- You're in a league of your own. Oh, I loved that movie. It took place in such an innocent time, when Madonna was still relevant, and Rosie was still funny. Come on, let's go home. Oh, one more thing. I know Travis flirted with you, but why did you shove him? I mean, it's just not like you. What did he say? It was nothing. What? Come on, tell me. I don't even remember. Yes, you do. Ok, you really want to know? He said That in bright light, that I looked fat and bald. What a jerk! I don't want to date anyone who's mean to you. And it's not true. You still have at least half your hair. Thank you, Jack. And you're not that fat, you just don't know how to dress your body. Hi. I fired Pam. I should've trusted you. You were right. The only reason I hired her was because of my liberal guilt. Sometimes I wish I were a Republican. Then I wouldn't have to worry about anyone's feelings. All I'd have to worry about is not getting indicted. Well, I'm glad you finally came to your senses, Grace. I mean, I could not believe what you would let her get away with. I would just sit there cleaning my gun, thinking, "This is an office!"   
                




                    			Elizabeth! Do you or do you not know how my Matthew McConaughey mug works? When you fill it with coffee, his shirt disappears. And what happens when the coffee's gone? His shirt comes back on. Exactly. Now, if I wanted to see Matthew McConaughey with his shirt on, I'd look at Josh Lucas. Now get out of my sight, Elizabeth! Hi, Elizabeth. So, uh, ready for lunch? I made a reservation at that place in Chelsea with the crayons and the leather place mats. Oh, and that's my favorite family S and M restaurant. But, I can't. I have to prepare for my interview today with Star Trek's George Takei. Sulu? Lieutenant Sulu is going to be on "JackTalk"?! He is such an inspiration! Coming out the way he did. And I was always a fan. I mean, I wasn't a Trekkie. That's that's geeky. I was a Sulu-head. An elite subset of soon to be gay men who sensed at an early age a kinship with the character of Sulu, based on his sensitivity and lingering looks at Captain Kirk. There he is. The queen of late night, Jack McFormand. That's not right, is it? Anyway big celeb, huh? George Hasato Takei, TV's Hikaru Sulu. You can get all that, but you can't get "McFarland"? Look, Jack. OutTV was bought by a large corporation. What? All you gotta know is it's not going to affect "JackTalk" in any way. - You feelin' me? - Yes, Jamie. No, you're not. And I told you you can, because my boyfriend's cool with it. I could put sexual harrassment lawsuit flyers in this lobby and retire. All right, I'll see you later, Jack. Oh. Uh, one little change. You're getting co-host. I can't believe this! My contract specifically says "No co-host." Uh Actually, Jack, it said "No Ho-Ho's." Relax, guys. This is just to widen our audience. You know, get a fresh point of view. Well, this co-host better not steal focus from me. I want a real toad. An Ed McMahon. Hi! I'm Amber-Louise, from the great state of Alabama. Oh, even better. A British woman. Oh, God! You made me look so slutty! Nice job. Thanks. My roommate's a drag queen. Don't judge me. I just do his face. I don't tuck it in or anything. So what do you want? Lipstick, mascara? Oh, I'm not going to be buying any make-up today. I don't really need it. I'm pregnant, so I have a natural glow. Wow. It took a lot of balls to say that. Hi, Grace Wow. Look at you. You know, most girls who are knocked up and abandoned by the love of their life get a little down. But you? You just keep piling on that make-up as if you actually believe that anybody's ever going to find you attractive again. I applaud your pluck. I'm just so excited about having this baby. I have someone to love and take care of for the rest of my life. That is so so cool. Wow. Well, Grace when you say it like that, it kind of makes me want to get one of those things. Hey. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna get a baby! Great. You go and get a baby. Just remember, though, if it's in a stroller, it's taken. I'm gonna run upstairs and get some giant bras. Or as the rest of the world calls it, B-cups. Excuse me? [READING HER NAME TAG] "Cricket"? Could I pay you to have a baby for me? What?! No. Having a baby is one of nature's most sacred miracles. You can't put a price tag on that. A hundred grand, and I'll throw in a tummy tuck after you pop. Mary Jane! Cover for me. I'm going on maternity leave. This is so exciting. I haven't been on TV since I was a little girl. And that was because our neighbor shot his wife. It was so sad, but since she was dead, and he was on trial, I got to use their pool for two whole summers. And that is what "JackTalk" is all about, Amber-Louise. Silver linings. Come on, let's sit down. Now. If you're going to be my co-host, you gotta learn how to keep up, all right? Because during the show, it gets ca-razy in here. I jump around, I make puns. I even rhyme words. It's insane. Rain. Jack, you're on in five minutes. And I couldn't find your Matthew McConaughey mug. Well, find it, Elizabeth Ann! My name's Dave. And I'm not gay at all. Like, at all. Hey! Back in your cage, straighty! Hey, Jack. Is George Takei here yet? I want him to sign his doll. They started making these after he came out of the closet. Listen to this. DOLL: Beam me down, Scotty. I'm going shopping! It's pretty cool, huh? He also says, "This planet has breathable air, and Gucci." Now. We're ready to bring out George Takei. Fun Fact: What he's wearing today is ugly. Jack, wait. That Star Wars guy He got pushed to tomorrow's show. You know what they say. Queer Takei, on tomorrow. Why wasn't I tod about this? Well, instead our parent company thought I should try a segment of my own. And I'll call it "Amber-Louise's musings!" And today's topic is, if you question our president, then you're a dirty traitor! Stars and dykes forever, where did this come from?! What the hell was that? Jamie, exactly who bought OutTV? Nimbus Television Networks. Which is owned by Digicity Global Worldwide. Which is a division of the Department of Homeland Security. Which I believe is owned by Nabisco. Cookies and the Bush administration. The gay community's two worst enemies have joined forces to bring us down. Well, Cricket. It looks like you're in perfect shape to be my surrogate. Oh. You sailed right through the breast exam. Yeah, about that. Shouldn't a doctor have done it? Why? So you can squirm away from him, too? Karen?! What is this surrogate contract you asked Will to draw up for you? Wait a minute. What is the make-up lady doing here? I didn't take the lipstick. It just fell into my purse. She's my surrogate! Isn't it a hoot? And I have a name, by the way. It's Cricket Walker. Karen, you can not just-- Wait a minute. You took Karen's name? Well, we are having a baby together. I'm a little old-fashioned. You rang? Yes, Lurch. Cricket here will be staying with us. Please arrange for a closet of clothes, her favorite foods, and the implantation of her tracking chip. Is this bitch for real? Hey. That bitch is the reason I have a home. And two million in a trust fund I get when I turn thirty-five. Karen, this is insane. And I say that as a friend, not one of the demon voices that guides you. How dare you judge me? You got pregnant by your ex-husband on an airplane and you haven't even told him yet. Huh. You just don't want anybody else to have a baby because you want all the attention. Oh. Oh, okay. Wow. That's what this is all about. Because I'm having a baby, you have to have one too. You're jealous. That's absurd. You know, most women would be thrilled to be pregnant at the same time as their best friend's cosmetic counter surrogate. Maybe you're just jealous because you're only getting a baby, but I'm getting a baby and a free make-up tote! What was Amber-Louise doing on the show today? That song and dance number attacking Hilary Clinton's legislative record? Pretty controversial. I mean, this move? It's so 80's. We are going to get letters. Jack, OutTV was bought by right-wing conservatives. Amber-Louise is just a mouth piece for your new bosses. You know, I kinda figured that's how she got the job. But I didn't want to say anything, because, you know glass houses They're using your show to push their agenda. I mean, even your studio audience is changing. There were people out there with mullets! And they weren't even lesbians! Jamie. Is this true? You bet, Jack. Now you get on board, or there's going to be serious ramifications. It doesn't mean what you think. Well, I'm not changing my show! I'm not gonna let it be some platform for spewing left-wing-- Right-wing. Right wing garbage that pushes the Democratic-- - Republican. - Republican magenta. Agenda. And good. I'm glad you're not compromising. I'd hate to see you roll over and take it. Again, doesn't mean what you think. Hey, Jack. I was wondering, maybe during interviews, you could ask people really tough questions. Not that I'm going to bomb them or torture them or anything-- Not that I'm totally against torture. You know, sometimes it's the only way to get reliable information. Forget it, A.L. No changes. "JackTalk" will remain the beacon of integrity it's always been. Now. If you'll excuse me, I have to go prep for tomorrow's segment, "Photographing Your Dog's Junk." Jack! You're making a huge mistake! If you want to get to the top, you gotta compromise, like me. What are you compromising? Okay. I'm-a let you in on a little secret. I'm not who you think I am. My real name is Peg, and I'm a hard-core lesbian. I'm into leather play, butch black girls, skunkin', pullin' the blinds, and poodle-ballin'. Whatever you got, I'll eat it, snort it, or ride it, baby! Look. Go along with this and it'll work for you. Look at me. I clear a 165 dollars a week. I moved out of my storage unit. I'm on TV! I'm the freakin' dream! You present a compelling case. I'm gonna have to wrestle with this for a while. Elizabeth, get the baby oil! Cricket? I've been watching you on the monitors and you seem unhappy. Is there anything I can do to make your stay more comfortable? Well. You know how you're always walking around here drunk, and popping pills and what not? And following me into the shower and throwing hot coffee on me and climbing into bed with me, hysterically crying and making me spoon you until you fall asleep? You gotta knock that off. Ha ha! You are cute as a button. Boop. So, why haven't I seen this husband of yours? Oh. He's on a business trip in the Phillipines. I like Filipinos. They're Asian, but not cocky about it. Well, as soon as he gets back, I'd like to meet him. You know, when possible, I like to talk to a man before he puts a load in my laundry basket. I'm not in my twenties anymore. Oh, honey. Uh I've been thinking. Maybe it's best if you don't meet Stanley. Why? Is he famous or something? Is he Stanley Tucci? Oh, my God! It's Stanley Tucci! I'm having Stanley Tucci's baby! No, honey, it's not Stanley Tucci. Come on. Sit down. The thing is I haven't told my husband. I'm keeping it a secret. Yeah. When the baby is born, I'm going to put it in a Pringles can and store it in the cupboard, and then when he opens can, the baby pops out, and we'll be really happy. Are you sure you are going to be able to keep a baby alive? We're sure going to try. Five minutes, Mr. Takei. Oh, did you get your gift basket? There was only a half-eaten muffin and a dirty freezer bag. Just wanted to make sure you got it. Mr. Takei? I'm a huge fan. Would you sign my doll? Oh, God. That sounded so girly. I'm an admirer of your work. Would you sign my doll? GEORGE TAKEI: Of course. I really respect you for coming out. Though I always knew. Like, in that episode Yeoman Rand was wearing that off the shoulder gown? I swear you slipped and said, "Set your phasers on stunning." GEORGE TAKEI: I did. Shatner laughed so hard, he split his girdle. Oh, George. Such an honor to meet you. Hey, are you done with that gift bag? I have a wet bathing suit I wanna bring home. Hi! I'm Amber-Louise. So nice to meet you. God bless America. And by that, I mean all Americans. Even the ones that need to be jailed without due process now and then. So, listen, George. The network asked that you not mention you're gay. Or any General Mills products. What? He will do nothing of the sort! And do you know why? Because this is Sulu. An original member from a show called Star Trek. Do you know what that show was about? Paper-mache rocks and Christmas lights poking through cardboard? It was about tolerance and acceptance, no matter what your color, species, or hairstyle. Did Spock hide his ears? Did Uhuru hide her femininity? Did Sulu hide his? Yes, he did. But it was a different time, we forgive you. The point is that no one on that bridge compromised who or what they were. That's what the show was about? Well, now I'm glad I did it. Come on, Jack. The show's starting. Make up your mind, George. Are you with us, or against us? And by "us", I mean the troops. George. Jack will do the right thing. Why don't you go grab yourself an Oreo? Which are suddenly everywhere. What are you doing? You can't let these people push you around. Look, I don't want to lose my job. I am too long and too hard to lose all this now. Yes, Jack, you have worked very long and very hard. But you have never compromised who you are. Jack, you're on. Here's your coffee. Uh, Elizabeth? This is not my Matthew McConaughey mug. Yeah, the network won't let you have him anymore. You have to drink out of Salma Hayek now. And we're on in five. Four, three, two Welcome to "Talk Time USA"! Hi, I'm Amber-Louise. And this is Jack. Today's special guest got his name in outer space, but back here on Earth, he is legendary ladies' man and pro-life activist-- No! I won't do it! George Takei is a prancing, giggling queen! And I will not slander his good name by implying he's straight. You were right, Will! Live long and prosper, Jack! I have never compromised myself before and I'm not about to start now. No man should ever be forced to drink out of Salma Hayek. I'll take her. I'm sure you'll be happy to know that Quicket crit. I mean Quicket crit! Damn it, that is so hard to say. All right, let me try this. Quicket is not going to carry my craby. Karen, why do you all of the sudden want to have a baby? I mean, if it's not because of me, there has to be a reason. And please don't tell me it's so you'll have a baby Jesus for your live nativity display. Okay, Grace. Let's just drop it shall we? Let's talk about something more pleasant. So. Guess who has a mole the size of an eyeball on their thigh? You know what? Forget it. I tried to be a friend, and for some reason you won't let me. So No, Grace. Stanley and I are having problems, and I I thought maybe having a baby would help. Karen, I had no idea. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. Ever since he came back from the dead, he's been different. I mean, not like a zombie or anything, but I don't know. Even the sex is different. Gosh, I can't tell you how long it's been since we've skunked, or poodle-balled. Have you tried lighting candles? I'm thinking about leaving him, Grace. Oh, Karen. All right, fine. I may have been fired by the people who brought us Guantanamo Bay and Reduced Fat Triskets, but at least I leave here with my dignity! Please, Amber-Louise, take me back! Ah! Bitch, get out of here! You spilled my Skittles! Get off! Please, Amber-Louise! I need this job! We're leaving with your dignity, remember, Jack?   
                




                    			- Hi. - Hey. So. If I hold this bag of groceries like this, can you tell I'm pregnant? I can tell, but then, I'm not part of the rhythm nation. We're having dinner with your parents, and if your mother finds out that I'm pregnant because I had unsafe sex on an airplane and haven't told the father yet because he's engaged to another woman, she is going to find some way of making it sound sordid. Fine. I'll wear a baggy coat, but with pockets. I'm keeping this fudge close. Still, I do not want them to find out yet. God only knows what your mother is gonna say. Oh, I'm guessing it's something in the ballpark of, "Don't worry, dear. Hardly anyone uses the term 'bastard' anymore." Or, "I would have thought a girl like you would have had a purse full of condoms." Those come way too easy for you. You know what? I'm not going. We have to go. My parents are officially back together. Since my father broke off his affair with Tina, they want to celebrate it. Fine. Then we'll just talk about that. I said celebrate it, not acknowledge it. As far as they're concerned, it never happened. - That's crazy. - That's Connecticut. I'm serious. That's what it says on the license plate. "Nothing potentially awkward". With a picture of a beaver looking the other way. Really? Are you sure you have all the astronauts you need? All right. Well, thanks for checking, Stephanie, is it? I'm sorry. Well, thank you Warren. Okay. Hey, honey. How you holding up since you got fired from "JackTalk"? [SIGHS] Honestly, Kare I'm a Chad Lowe. There are no jobs out there. And I've even checked outer space. Trust me, honey. You do not want to work in outer space. Nope. You just spend your whole day chasing floating poop. Now, Jackie, come on. I mean, I don't know who you're trying to kid. We both know there's only one thing that you ever wanted to be. A strategically placed staple in an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog? Heh No, honey. An actor. That's the only thing that you've ever been passionate about in your entire life. And look at you. You're built for it. You've got little short legs, and a big torso, and a wobbly head like Al Pacino. Ah, never mind. I can't go back. I said farewell to acting not once, not twice, but thrice times. That's my Shakespearean training. You never lose it. I do miss it. Well, of course you do, honey. And you've clearly been looking for auditions. I mean, come on, there's a copy of Backstage magazine right here! Or, as I like to call it, Waiter Weekly. Well, I'd be lying if I said I only bought it to hide the copy of Latino Inches I was reading on the subway. I do want to get back in, Karen! Both to acting and Latino men. Hey. Look at this right here. Here's something you'd be good for. It's for a new TV cop show, the role of "Squealing Queen #3". Squealing Queen? How would I even begin to play that? Karen! You're bending my ethnic porn! God. I wish I still had my acting teacher, Zandra. She was an incredible coach. The second your acting was fake, she put a cigarette out in your ear. - Hi, hi. - Hey. There's my son. Look at him. So good with clothes. Is there anything you can't wear? Well mom's clothes. Remember, we talked about that when I was ten? I was never angry you were wearing them. I was angry you had them tailored. Grace-- I can't wait to get you kids down in the basement. Or as I refer to it now, the micro-brewery. Oh, you know, George has taken up the most magnificent hobby. He's fermenting hops. Wow. I haven't been down to the basement in years. Yeah. Not since I turned into a roller disco for my sweet sixteen party. Mom and I had such a good time. So, you're making beer? Oh, no, no, no. It's not beer. It's small batches of boutique ale. And by the way, I called the first one "Georgie's Girl". Because it's bubbly, full-bodied, and six-percent alcohol. Oh, you guys look so cute, ever since you got back to the-- - -future. The DVD. Great movie. Really brings people together. Not that you had an affair. I-- I brought fudge. Come on. Come on, kids. Have a Georgie Girl. You gotta try it. Oh, be careful when you drink it, will you, because I lost a cigar during the process. None for me, thanks. Why? You pregnant? No! No, I'm not pregnant. I'm-- An alcoholic. Yes. It's a shock, I know. And beer is her real problem. Th-th-that's how she got that big gut. Heh. Thanks for that. I I am pregnant. Oh, thank God. I would hate to think that you stopped drinking for some emotional problem. Grace, that is fantastic news. Our little girl Hey, who, um I mean? Hey, don't look at me. I haven't been near that thing since college. Well, whether you like it or not, I'm going to tell you what I think about you being pregnant. Oh, uh, dad, why don't you take us downstairs and show us how beer is made. It's okay. Marilyn, I got pregnant with my ex-husband's baby, by accident. Well, darling, I was about to say that I think you are going to make a wonderful mother. And whatever I can do to help, I'm here. Thank you. Oh, look who I brought! It's Zandra, your old acting teacher! Oh, my God. Zandra, how are you? Where's that ham sandwich I ordered, you walking fart. So, Z. Thanks for helping me with this audition. I couldn't do it without you. Here's the scene I'm working on. Now, you read the part of hard-boiled Detective Chuck Rafferty. He's one of the leads. And I'll be reading Squealing Queen #3, who says "Eek. You dropped your gun." I don't want your magazine. I just wanna know when we're gonna land. You see that, Karen? She's trying to get me to understand that I'm the pilot of my own career. Really? Because it seems like she's just trying to suck ketchup out of her hair. These fries are too thin. Too thin. Good point. There's not a lot on the page. Yeah. I don't know, honey. I took a dropper full of cat tranquilizers this morning, and even I think she's a little off. [SIGHS] Karen. This woman is a genious, and clear as a bell. I know you. You're Jack McFarland. The worse actor I ever saw! Oh, my God, Karen, you're right! She's crazy! She's talking absolute nonsense. What am I gonna do now? I can't go on that audition. Not without Zandra. Honey, come on. You don't need her. Hell, I can put a cigarette out in your eye. In my ear, Karen, not my eye! You obviously have no understanding of the craft. Hey, Grace. Look what I found in the attic. I almost broke my neck tripping over Will's old Easy Bake Oven. It's a gift for me? For the baby. Oh, that's nice too. Hey, What's that? Oh, your dad just gave it to me. It's a baby blanket. And, oh, and it's beautiful. And it's mine. Oh, George, that was so thoughtful of you. My mother made it when Will was born. Don't let the Pierre Cardin label fool you. He sewed it in when he was eight. I'm so touched. It's been dry cleaned, right? Oh, are you kidding? If this one didn't see it come back once a week folded over a hanger, he cried and cried. So, wait a minute. You gave Sam his baby blanket, and you gave Paul his, but you're giving mine to Grace? What do you want to do with it? Let it sit in the attic for another 40 years? Come on. Whenever Will was upset, he would clutch that blanket up to his chest. Oh, it's sweet. Thank you, George. This way it stays in the family. Yeah. Sort of. Let's eat, huh? It kind of smells like Drakkar Noir. Oh, he slept on it well into junior high. Thanks for taking me to this dance club, Karen. You know, to get my mind off not auditioning. I don't know about this place. It's kind of lame. There's no music, there's no lights, there's no bar These losers look like they'd go home with any buck-toothed fool. Hey, Adam. Hey, Ken. Jack McFarland? Is Jack McFarland here? I'm Jack McFarland. Oh. Your audition's next. What?! They think I'm going to audition to be at this club? Jackie, how stupid are you?! This is your audition! I tricked you. Look around! I can't believe you, Karen. I said I wouldn't do this. - Jack. - I'm scared. Of what? It's only acting, for God's sake. I mean, how hard can it be? Kate Beckinsale can do it. You know what you're scared of? You're scared of doing something on your own for once in your life. I mean it, Jackie. Whether it's me paying your rent, or Will paying your bills or Zandra helping you out with your auditions It's always something. And you know what, honey? It was cute when you were younger. It's not cute anymore. - Karen. - Don't "Karen" me. For years now, I've watched you flit from career to career, and you always come back to this. And you know why? Because this is the only thing that you have ever really cared about. And now-- It's the only thing you've got, Jackie. So. When they call your name, you go in there and squeal like your life depends on it. Because, honey it does. This is it, Jackie. You've run out of options. Jack McFarland-- We're waiting. Break a leg, Jack. Why are you washing dishes? We haven't even had desert. There is desert, right? We had desert. That cheese and fig thing? Wasps What's wrong with you? You pouted all through dinner. Is this about the blanket? Yes, of course it's about the blanket. I don't want to discuss it. I certainly don't want to discuss it with them. I am stuffed. Uh, boy me too. Uh, I'm just going to go gas up the car. I'll be back in about five minutes. You and your rituals. You always have to fill the tank right after dinner. - Where you going? - Burrito place. - Get me two. - You got it. Will, you wanna go for a ride with the old man? No thanks. - You okay? - I'm good. Really? You barely said two words at dinner. You want two words? Fine. I'll give you two words. My. Blanket. Will, what does that mean? Are you upset I gave the blanket to Grace? I'm upset that you didn't save it for me. What do you want to do? You still want to sleep with that thing? You know, he slept with it for so long, I finally had to tell him a black man robbed us and took it. Oh. Only now I realize how awful that sounds. I mean, today I would just say "a man." An Arab man. I want my blanket so that I can give it to my baby. Since when are you going to have a baby? I'm not, but I might. One day. Didn't occur to me. There's a shocker. It didn't occur to you that your gay son might have kids. Now, what does that mean? You want to have kids, have kids. You know, I've got a bunch of blankets in the attic. You know what? I can take any one of those. And then Will, you can have this one back. That's not what this is about, Grace. It's about my father, after all these years, just assuming that I'm not gonna have kids because I'm gay. Will, aren't you being a little dramatic? Well, that's what we gays do, isn't it? Get overly dramatic. Here we are, back in the gay minefield. The flowers are prettier, but the bombs are still there. You think this is funny? No, I think this is frustrating that every time you have a problem with me, it's because you're gay. That's because me being gay is the problem. It's always been the problem! You keep saying you've accepted it, but every thing you do makes it obvious you haven't. - How dare you-- - Who wants desert?  talk to me like that. After all I've done to accept who you are. All you've done? Wow. Is it that much work? He was just trying to do something nice for me-- Grace. Please stay out of this. You know what? I don't need to stay here and have this conversation. No, no, dad. We are finishing this! Please, Will. Just stop this. No, he doesn't want to stop. I think he's enjoying this. You think I enjoy having a father who's ashamed of me? Don't you put words in my mouth. - I never said I was ashamed of you! - Then answer me this-- Would you, or would you not prefer that I was straight. - Will, enough. - No. I want to hear him say it. What? Do I think your life would be easier? Do I think you'd be happier? - So that's a yes! - I didn't say prefer! No, but that's what you mean! You're just not saying the words. Fine! You want the words? Yes. I'd prefer you weren't gay. Thanks. Come on, Grace, we're leaving. Oh please, don't go, Will. Not like this. Well, um Thanks for the blanket Say there. You look like a cute out of work gay boy. I don't supposed you'd be interested in hopping around for pocket change and answering to the name "Poodle"? Do I get to play with those? Of course. And thank you for noticing. Do you have a card? I already have one of you, but I think I may have destroyed him. Honey, how'd it go? How'd it go? Thanks to you, I blew it! Well, whatever it takes to get the part. No! I was so overwhelmed by what you said, I almost couldn't get the words out. I didn't do any of my trademark moves. Like sad puppy. Or dream state. I didn't even indicate distance. I just said the line like a nothing. You couldn't even tell I was acting. It was just natural and unforced. Like I wasn't even me. Like-- I became this whole other person. Who cares, it was awful! I've absolutely no flair for the dramatic! Dear God, whatever will become of me Well, don't worry, honey. You'll be fine, because you tried. So you didn't get this part. You'll get the next one. I'm really proud of you. Jack McFarland? I know, I know. I didn't get the part of the squealing queen. No, you didn't. You got the part of Detective Chuck Rafferty. Chuck Rafferty? The straight, angry cop with a drinking problem who beats on his wife? Oh. And they say the sitcom is dead. I can't believe it. But, that's one of the leads. How is this possible? They said you just were Chuck Rafferty. A devastated narcissist careening toward a dismal future. Okay. Now I know I'm good, because I don't even know half those words. You know it's been two days. When are you gonna talk to your dad? And talk about what? I'm still gay. I have no good news for him. He obviously has something he wants to say to you. He's left you, like, six messages. I'll call him later. I'm not ready now. Not now. Can we just sit here a while? Sure. Oh, my God. Look at that. The baby kicked. It's happened a couple of times now. - That's amazing. - I know. She's gonna be a soccer player. Or he's gonna be a Rockette. It's your dad. Come on. You have to talk to him. Please. Just come on. Hey, dad. Hi, Mom. What are-- Oh, my God. Where are you? I-I'll be right there. I love you, too. Will? My dad had a heart attack. Oh, my God. Are they at the hospital? Yeah. But he didn't make it.   
                




                    			I guess we beat Will back from the funeral home. I can't believe he stayed so composed during his father's eulogy. Especially since the last time they saw each other was that huge fight. Well, Marilyn totally kept it together, too. Will really is his mother's son. I mean, they actually have similar bodies. Except Will's wrists are a little smaller. I feel so badly for his little gay nephew, Jordie. He was so upset. Jordie. Which one was he? The nine year old, with the little black funeral shawl. He sang "Sunrise Sunset." So touching. Then you're gonna love it the next time Stan dies and I sing "Happy Days are Here Again"! I suppose I could tolerate it if he just wasn't coming at me for sex every minute! - Grace, would you be willing to-- - No. Oh, hey look. Here comes Will and Marilyn. Oh, his forehead is so shiny. I'm not going to say anything. You know, 'cause his dad's dead. Hey, guys. We would have got here sooner, but my Aunt Joanne lost her keys. Turns out she dropped them into the casket. Why she chose to reorganize her purse up there is beyond me. I mean, George didn't even like her. And now he has to spend the rest of eternity lying next to her Pathmark grocery card and rape whistle. All right, now, now. Now, listen-- If you both need anything, just let us know. Okay? Wow. That was like holding a lollipop and a barber pole. Will, come, come sit. Talk with us. Oh, thanks, Grace, but the rest of the guests will be getting here any minute, and my father would want everyone to be comfortable and to use a coaster. Actually, that's me. That's what I want. You know, honey Normally my motto is "Drugs, Not Hugs". But today I feel different. Come on. Thank you, Karen. Look, guys, I appreciate that you're trying to make me feel better-- We're just a little worried. That's all. You know, 'cause 'Cause, I know-- I had a horrible fight with my father before he died. But there's no point in focusing on that. I mean, there's nothing I can do about it. So, I would just love if today could be about celebrating his life. You really sure that's what you want? Yes, I am. I like that. You know, Will, I really loved your father. This one time, I called and told him I was in the hospital and I needed $5000 dollars. And he just sent it to me, no questions. You did what?! Shh! We're celebrating, we're celebrating. It's nice that everybody came to pay their respects to my dad. I know. Oh, there's Ellen. I'm gonna go say hi. Eh. I'll wait for her to find me. Hey, guys. Jordie, you feeling better? It looked like you really hurt your arm when you threw yourself on the casket. I didn't even feel it. Performance adrenaline. Hey, why don't you go watch TV with your Uncle Paul, huh? I personally think it's a weird time to get into a "Bewitched" marathon, but you can't judge how people grieve. So, uh How you holding up, huh? It's nice how many people showed up. Oh crap, I just made eye contact with Ellen. Excuse me. Ellen, thank you for coming So, uh, I never had a chance to congratulate you on the baby. You look terrific. Thank you, Sam. You okay? Uh, you know It's still a shock. I didn't know whether to be brave for Jordie and Casey or cry it out. So, I cried bravely. You know, like a man, in a low voice, while I was changing the oil on my car. And, uh, I also found out that being drunk helps. Yeah, it's all been very Valley of Dolls. Oh. Do you even get that reference? Of course. It's from before you were even born. Unless you're forty. [TO SAM] He's not, is he? There, there Let it out Oh, no. I wasn't crying. I was laughing. My hair was tickling my face. Hee-hee-hee. That's your laugh? Sounds like a squirrel orgy. Thanks. Oh, you're really sweet to talk to me. When someone dies, nobody ever asks how the mistress is doing. Yeah. Tell me about it. Not one person came up to me at Reagan's funeral. I have a nice story about George. I hope I didn't oversell it. Hey, Will, come here! Larry's got a hilarious story about your father! Best one I heard all day. JOE: If this is the story I think it is, you'd better embellish. I am very stressed right now and you are not helping me. - Okay. - Yeah. Hey, guys. Hey, Will. I haven't seen Grace. Is she here? Gee, Ellen, I'm not sure. So, Larry, what's the story? Well, the last time I saw your father, he said the kindest thing to me. He said, "Larry, my friend, that is quite a sweater." That's it? That's your story? That stunk. You're supposed to make him feel better about his dad, not worse about his friends. Oh, hi, Casey. Where's Grandpa? Oh. Um-- Well, the truth is-- Grandpa George is gone. Well, no, he's not gone. His spirit will be with you forever. A spirit is kind of like a ghost. So even though your dead grandpa's body is underground, his ghost is going to be with you forever. In your house. At school. Wherever you go. Understand? Man, I rocked that. The last time I saw Grandpa, we played baseball in the back yard. Well, we played A League of Their Own. He was Tom Hanks. I was everybody else. That's wonderful, Jordie. Another great last moment with my dad. Really, I can't hear enough of them. You know, you really do kind of look like Rosie O'Donnell. Yeah, I get that a lot. Well, more so when I had my natural color. Yeah. I knew it was a dye job. Hey, next time don't forget the eyebrows. Sloppy! Um, Grace? What'd you say to Casey? She's hiding in the closet, crying, because she thinks the ghost of her dead grandfather is chasing her. What? No. No, all I said to her was the ghost was watching her. Oh, yes. Yes, that is different. Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare her. God, I have-- I have no idea how to talk to kids. This thing is gonna want to talk now and then, right? Listen, you just have to learn to sugar coat things a little bit, you know? Like, for instance, I didn't tell Casey that mommy and daddy were getting a divorce because her mother was a crazy bitch. No, I just said that mommy was a princess, who's going to live with a prince, who's got a brokerage firm in Pelham, and used to be daddy's best friend. I think I got it. Thank God I stopped before I said he was wrapped in chains. Vince, hi. Hey. I thought I'd stop by. I hope that's okay. I was at the funeral too, but I sat in the back 'cause I came in late. I went to the wrong funeral first. I thought your dad was black for like twenty minutes. Well thank you for coming. It means a lot. What happened to your hand? Oh, that? It's no big deal, you know. I accidentally got shot by my partner. You know, we both need to be really clear what side you land on when you're having the "Let me pick the lock/No, let me shoot it off" debate. I guess that's a lesson you needed to learn twice. You know, the service? Really beautiful. It must have been comforting to hear all those really nice things people had to say about your father. Yeah. Yeah, it did. Will you excuse me a minute? Oh, sure. Oh. Hey, Vince! Oh, okay. Aah! Good to see you, too. So, listen, I'm really glad you're here. I'm not so sure Will is. You know, I think I'm gonna go. No, no, no. No, no, no. I need you. I have been playing a cop in a new TV show, and I would love some pointers. The only cop things I've ever done are use handcuffs, and say to somebody, "Do you have any idea how fast you were going?" What's going on? Rob just told the funniest story about the last time he saw your father. Rob's got a story. Great. Super. - You okay? - I'm fine. How about you, Will? You must have a funny story about your dad. - No, no. - Come on! Come on, Will! All right, I got a story. I think you're all gonna get a kick out of this one. The last thing my father said to me before he did was that he wished I wasn't gay. - Will - No. That's a great story. Obviously no one saw it coming. God knows I didn't. And the best part is, that's the moment I'm stuck with for the rest of my life. Will, what's going on? Why would you stop there? You had to know I was coming after you. Really? You're going to blame this on me? Today? I'm not blaming you. I'm just saying it wasn't my fault. Look, the fight you had with your father does not define your entire relationship. I mean, think about it. You and I fight all the time. It's almost a statistical impossibility that you and I are not going to be in a fight when we die. Don't say statistics to me. I took your statistics final for you. Yeah, and I still got a C. Unless you're touring the kitchen with the Royal Shakespeare Company, you can knock off the asides. No matter how it ended, your father loved you. You know that. He said he wished I wasn't gay, Grace. That's me. I'm gay. He wished I wasn't me. And I can'tt forgive him for that. Okay, okay. I-I understand that you're upset. But do you think that you might also be upset because you can't forgive yourself? For what? I don't know For not forgiving him when you had the chance. Thank you, Grace. Now on top of everything else, I get to feel guilty. - That is not what I was trying-- - No, listen. You-- You know-- I love you, and you're probably right-- It just makes me feel worse. This is so great. All of us together, sharing stories. I love you, honey. Rob, why do you always have to ruin the moment? You know, Marilyn, my husband may not be dead, but my love for him is. So if you ever need a drinking buddy, I'll drink with you. Or if you ever need a shoulder to cry on, I'll drink with you. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I love to drink. Oh, thank you, Karen. You'll get a call. Oh! Oh, no, Tina. Tina, please. You don't have to sneak out of here like you just heard my car pull up in the driveway. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come. Oh, no. No, no. I'm really glad that you're here. After all, we both lost someone we loved, hmm? Thank you for being George's companion during-- during those years in the middle when he put on a little weight. Oh, no problem. Truth is, I kind of like 'em a little fat. Excuse me, miss, how fat are you willing to go? Casey, I was wrong about grandpa. He's not a ghost. He's up in heaven. And heaven is so much better than here. You get to live on a cloud made of cotton candy, and all you do is play with puppies, and-- And eat cookies for dinner. Here, you spend you whole life looking for someone to love you, and most people never find that person. So, don't you worry about grandpa. He's the lucky one. He's dead. Red wine Oh-- Mom. Will, close the door please. I don't think I've ever seen you cry before. I hate crying in front of people, so I come in here. And nobody can hear me under the sound of the dryer. You want me to go? Maybe you should It'll probably take a while 'til it-- Oh, there. All better. Look, Mom I'm sorry I snapped. I just can't stop thinking about the fight with dad. Oh, Will. Your father felt terrible, too. You're his son. He was so proud of everything about you. He just got pushed against the wall, and it came out all wrong. I know, I know. I just should've just accepted that when it came to me being gay, he just had limitations. No, he did. But, uh You know, William, you have limitations, too. What do you mean? Well, look how that argument started. I mean, you came in and announced, for the very first time, that you wanted children. And then you were angry when we were surprised. How could you be surprised? Well, because you never share anything with us. You never have. Really, you are so secretive, Will. Honestly, I don't know where you get it. Grandma, what are you doing in here? Making cupcakes, darling. Go away. Now, where was I? I'm secretive and you don't know where I get it from. Well, the fact is, your father was thrilled that you wanted a baby. He was? Yes. I only wished that you had told us before. Told us anything about your life. You know, you have never introduced us to any of your boyfriends. That lovely man, Vince, why has he never been to the house before? I don't know. I guess I just never thought you'd want to meet them. Now it's too late. Ow. Ow, fabric softener. Ow. That stings. And softens. Here. It's all right. Just let it go. He's gone. But we're not. And if we've learned anything through all of this, you have to tell the people you love how you feel while you have the chance? - I miss him so much, mom. - Oh, darling No, Jack. You'd only tell the person, "Put your hands in the air." You wouldn't say, "And wave 'em like you just don't care." Okay. I am learning so much. Now, does "assume the position" mean what I hope it does? Hey, guys. Hey, Will. Have you been crying? Yeah. Good. It's about time. So, how you doing? It's been a rough day. Listen, it's come to my attention that I, uh I don't always express my emotional state to the individuals that I care about Really? 'Cause that was warm. Look, I miss you. A lot. When I saw you walk in this room, I was so happy. And I just I just wanted to tell you that. Even though I know you're seeing someone. Well, actually, Will, I'm not seeing anyone anymore. I miss you, too. All right. This should be everything you need to know to have an affair with Stan. Directions to the manse, the security code, and of course, a diagram of his body. The part with the arrow next to it is where you'll want to focus. Oh, thank you. I never would have guessed to look there.   
                




                    			Grace, Hurry up. We're gonna be late for our childbirth class. You know what was a bad idea? Watching Alien last night. Now every time I feel the baby kick, I think it's trying to chew it's way out of me. Well, it's your baby. It's gonna chew something. Stop worrying you're gonna be fine. As long as you go to class and do everything right. Have you taken your pre-natal vitamins? Let me see your nails. Good. Nice and healthy. Wow! Look at your nails. You'd think you were taking pre-natal vitamins, too. Yeah, I am. Yeah, my nails are stronger, my hair is thicker. My balls be shrinking, but who cares. You know, I use my fabulous hair and nails to draw the men in. Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late. Ever since I made detective, it takes me forever to figure out what I'm gonna wear. You know, the right shirt can really pull together a crime scene. Oh, um Will and I are just heading out to my childbirth class. He's my-- my labor coach. I hope that's okay, I asked Vince to come along with us 'cause we're gonna go to the movies later on. But nothing with Nicole Kidman. I'm not a fan since she and Keith Urban became the hot lesbian couple. Hey, Vince. Hey, Will. Hey, Grace. Hey, little Jack. I'm not naming my baby Jack. What baby? I was talking to my penis. You guys, I'm so freaked out! I just got the first script for my new TV show, "The Badge." And my character, Detective Chuck Rafferty, has to pistol whip somebody. Hey, you know Jack, maybe I could help you. When I was addicted to pain killers, I used to pistol whip people for jaywalking. Yeaahhh. No. I need a man's man. Someone who really knows what it is to be a violent, womanizing alcoholic. Hey, kids. Ugh. I'm so glad that Jewpetto and Feynoccio are finally gone. You know, it's really starting to bug me that they are always hanging around here. And, honey, it's perfect because there's so much going on at the manse, I really need to talk to you. Karen, I'm sorry, I can't! I'm due on the set, and I still haven't figured out a way to access anger for my pistol whipping scene. You know, it is hard to stay angry when pistol whipping. I think it's because after the first couple of whacks, you get the giggles. Anyway honey, I really do need to talk to you. This is about my marriage. Uh, and this is about television. Right. And right now, I really need you to help me rehearse my scene. Okay. Well, as long as we can talk about my stuff afterward. - Okay. - Okay. All right. You've got ten seconds 'til I start pounding you like a five dollar whore. You got that, pumpkin? Um. Well. Honey, this says "punk." Are you sure you should be changing the lines? You know, you're right. I really should respect the vision of these 26 writers. Wow. Look at those names. It's like Schindler's list. You know, honey, maybe I can help you. You know, back in the day when I was roommates with Stanislovs-- Oh! I mean, Uta Haga-- I mean Claire Daines. We used to study a technique called "sense memory". It's were you recall an earlier experience and then recreate that emotion. It's a form of method acting. Sounds kind of out there. I mean, I've never heard of it. And I taught acting. Well, here's an example. If I had to make myself angry, I would take myself back to Well, this morning, when Stan was slurping and sawing his way through his usual breakfast. Two poached deer and a half a grapefruit. I felt my stomach begin to tighten. And I thought, if I have to sit here for one more day, I am literally going to leap across this table and rip his heart right out of his body. I mean, I am going to claw my way through the hair and the flesh and the fat, and the internal hair, and more fat until I hold his beating and squeeze until it is still! Oh, my God, Karen. I had no idea it was so easy to look angry. All I have to do is squeeze my fist and grimace! Cagney and Lacey underwear, I'm late! Thank you so much, Karen. You saved my life. Hey, wait a minute! What about my stuff?! Didn't you hear a word I just said? No, I was too busy watching you. I can't look and listen at the same time. I'm not some robot from the future. So you're okay out here while we're in class? God yeah. I got a ton of paperwork. If we're ever gonna catch this lunatic who's been killing people in the subway, I gotta spend all my free time pouring over every detail of this case. A subway killer? That's terrifying. We're still going to the movies though later, right? Oh, God, yeah, but we're taking a cab. Okay, let's get started. Oh, could we wait another minute? My boyfriend's not here yet. Sheila, I'm sorry, but we can't do this every class. I know he'll be here. I left 15 messages for him at his wife's house. Now I know where I know you from. Didn't you work at a fertility clinic I went to a couple of years ago? Oh, yeah. You know, after I got fired I took your sperm and put it in my freezer for eight months. Small world. It's probably not any of my business, but that's not mine, is it? Nah. I went with an Irish guy. I wanna be able to drink with my kid. It just breaks my heart to think of that woman going through this all by herself. Sheila, don't you think you should get rid of that? I think it's a little too late. You know what? I'm gonna get Vince to help her. Although he's probably knee-deep in that research material about the serial killer. Aw, yes! Six kids and living in a castle! Cut! Great work, guys. You were amazing. In that scene Jack, you were so intense! I thought you were going to pistol whip me for real. I wanted to. It bugs me when straight people look like you. Honey, how'd it go? Great, Karen. That stuff you taught me really works. Good. Well, I wanted to watch the scene, but just as it was starting, a red light went on. And well old habits die hard. So, honey, remember when I said I needed to talk to you earlier? Well, now, you'll never believe-- Good. The pages for my next scene. I'm sorry, Kare. Go on. Okay. Well, uh, after I left you, I went straight back to the manse because, honey, I finally knew what I needed to do. But then, the most unexpected thing happened-- Oh, my God, Karen! I have to have sex with a woman! I don't know how to do that. It never occurred to me that my character, womanizer Chuck Rafferty, would have sex with a woman. I thought "womanizer" meant he eliminated women. But, honey, seriously, I really do need to tell you-- But wait, wait, Karen, I really need your help again. - All right. - Okay. All right. My character makes love to his partner's wife, but then it gets all sad because it can never happen again. Okay, first of all, why is he sad? I mean, he should be happy he doesn't have to have sex with a woman again. Honey, sometimes sex can be very sad. Take this afternoon, when Stan and I made love Jackie, I had planned to ask him to move out. But then [SIGHS] I don't know Our eyes met in the mirror while he was brushing his tooth And he touched me, Jackie. He touched me in a way that he hasn't touched me since we met. Twenty years Twelve heart attacks, and untold melanomas ago. Heh. Poor guy. He's so fat a part of him is always in the sun. Then as I closed my eyes and surrendered to the moment, I felt all of my rage just slipping away. I missed him. I missed who he was, and who we once were. And then I knew. I knew that that was the last time that we would ever be together like that again. Perfect. All I have to do is close my eyes and sigh. Then it will be easier for me to imagine the actress playing my partner's wife is actually Kevin Bacon in a Speedo made of Twizzlers. That's all you got from what I just said? You know, Jack, I've got real problems, and if you're not going to help me, I'm not always going to be here at your beck and call! Kevin Bacon called?! Now, let's get used to carrying a baby. But, please be careful with them. They were used to train police dogs, so one of them might have a brick of heroin in it. Excuse me, I gotta get this. It's either my mother or my captain. I get their numbers confused. They're both bitches. Hurry up, I don't want the one that looks like Mena Suvari. What are you talking about? What plastic baby looks like-- Oh there she is. Now a few of them are missing arms and legs, so you'll just have to make due. I'll take one of those. I might as well get used to it. So, you're alone, too, huh? Oh, no, no. I'm not alone. I have Will. And, uh, one of these days I mean, as soon as I get in touch with the father, I'll have him, too. That was my captain. They found another body in the D-Train. I'm gonna have to pop by the coroner's office. That's horrible. Are we gonna miss the movie? Not if we leave now. Can you finish the class by yourself? Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. I'll see you later tonight. Actually, I'm gonna be at Vince's tonight. Okay. I'll see you when I see you. Bye. Oh, this is yours. Jack, can I give you a little constructive criticism? Uh, take it up with someone else. I didn't build the sets. No, I-- I actually think we need more rehearsal. I mean, do you want to go over the next scene? Okay. But I just can't, you know. turn it on. I need some time to get in the character. Okay. Chuck. We need to talk about your partner, Darren. Do you even want to know why he walked out of here angry? Darren wasn't [FLIPS PAGE] angry. Yes, Darren was. Darren was trying to tell you something, but you were too caught up acting like a big shot cop to actually listen. Um, the line is "shut up, bitch." Oh, I'm sorry. Shut up, bitch! I won't shut up. YOu and Darren have been friends for years, and you weren't there when he needed you most. Now, he has to use a walker. Look at this picture. Look at it close, Rafferty! Darren. Walker. Darren, your best friend needed you and you didn't listen. Oh, my God. Darren Walker needed me and I didn't listen. I'll be right back. Can we get somebody from the constructive crew? I have some criticism for them. Hey, did I tell you we finally caught that subway killer today. I thought you said you arrested somebody yesterday. Oh yeah, it turns out he was the wrong guy. Worked him over pretty good, too. Well, at least now he has a funny story. Grace! Come on. You ready for class? Oh, geez, I gotta go pick up Sheila. I'll see you there, all right? You're still her partner? Yeah, she's a good kid. Plus it'll be nice to help somebody deliver a baby in a hospital instead of a Burger King or an upside down Trans Am. Thanks for interrupting my sex dream just as Ang Lee and I were getting out of the pool. A sex dream about Ang Lee? What was that like? A little slow-paced, but visually stunning. Here. Drink your protein drink. I'm gonna be at Vince's again tonight. We're gonna stay in and be slow-paced, but visually stunning. You know what? I hate these protein shakes. So does every gay man in the city. But, like you, we drink them for somebody much younger than we are, who we hope one day will look at us with adoring eyes. Sorry. Not drinking it. Okay. I guess is the first time I'm going to have to use the red marker on the chart. [ANNOYED] You know what? This isn't working for me. I'm tired of you constantly hovering over me and watching my every move. So, you know It's my baby. I think I know what's best. I never said I knew what was best. I'm just trying to help. Yeah. And I'm just saying maybe I don't need your help. Oh. Okay. I know what this is. I have been charting your progesterone and you are spiking. Will, you're not the President. Get out of my uterus. I'm going to class. Well, wait for me. No. I don't need a partner. I can do it alone. Felicia. Mr. Stanley will be moving out of the manse. His arms and chest will be leaving today. The rest of him should be out by tomorrow. - Hey, Kare. - Well. Look who's here. Shouldn't you be making love to a TV woman while holding down vomit? Karen, please talk to me. I want to know what's going on with you. No, you don't. And you wouldn't be able to hear it anyway. Okay. Then will you help me rehearse my next scene? No, Jack. Forget it. I'm too busy. Please, Karen. It's an important monologue and I really think you should hear it. Fine. Make it snappy. While packing his things, three maids got tangled in Stan's pajama bottoms and I've got to go cut them out. Okay. We've been friends for a long time, Darren, and I let you down today Darren. I should have been there for you, but I got wrapped up in my own stuff that I just didn't listen. I'm sorry it's over between you and Franley. And I know things seem really scary for you, but you're a strong woman, Darren, and you're going to come out of this okay. And I'll be there for you for anything you need. Darren. During your breakup with Franley. I'm Jack. Come on, you call that writing? Those Jews should stick to comedy. Karen, didn't you just hear a word that I said? [SIGHS] Of course I did, honey. I may be a pill-popping, jet fuel sniffing, gin-soaked narcissist but I'm not an actor. I listen when people speak. Hey. What are you doing here? Grace said you weren't coming. I didn't ask her why, 'cause I saw the way her levels were spiking on your graph. What are you doing out here? Sheila's been in the bathroom for like, half an hour. Yo! Haul it out here, trailer park! Shut up, grease ball, my water broke! Oh, geez. All right. Visualize your breath. And put out that cigarette! What are you doing here? I don't want you walking home alone. Someone just got killed in this city. They're calling it the "Could be Anybody Killer". I know it was Vince's turn to name the killer and that's what he came up with. - Here. Let me help. - Really, I've got it. - No, I wanna help. - I don't want your help. Well, you're gonna get it anyway. Now look what you did! We're supposed to treat these like they're real babies! Calm down. I'm sure a real baby's head wouldn't come off quite so easily. I told you I could do it myself. But you don't have to. You don't have to do any of this yourself. You have me. No, I don't. I mean, yes, right now, during the course of this class, I do. But once that baby comes, I'm on my own. It's just me. You're starting a whole new life with Vince, and that's-- that's great. And Leo's starting a whole new life with his fiancée and that sucks. But you know what? There's nothing I can do about it, so I have to be realistic. If I am going to have to raise this headless torso by myself, then I really I need to start getting used to it now. Grace. After all we've been through, do you really think that I wouldn't be there for you after this baby is born? Of course I'll be there for you. You say that like it's so easy. This is so much bigger than anything we've ever been through. Listen to me. I already love this baby more than I could have imagined. And if you want me to, I'll be there for the whole thing. From diapers to college which, quite frankly, I already assumed I'll be paying for. You really mean it? It would be an honor. So we're we're gonna do this together? We already are. I'm really sorry, Karen. I wish I'd been there for you. Honey, it's okay. It's just important that you're here for me now. Now. If you'll excuse me, honey, I'm going to go take some of those pills I've been stealing from Grace. Gosh, my nails are stronger, my hair is thicker, but I think my balls may be shrinking.   
                




                    			Wow, this baby name book is really great. Oh, here's a pretty one: Clitorissa. That's "Clarissa". Oh, well, that's just gross. Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late. Grace, that's for you. Oh, my God. It's the Bugaboo Gecko Suspension Stroller. It's a knock-off. I got it from the evidence locker. But don't touch the inside. I still got to dust it for prints and scrape it for a blood match. Thanks, Vince It's the first gift I've ever received that was part of a crime scene. Second. Anyway. We're done here, right? Because I'm meeting my sister Ginny for lunch, and I'm running late. Did you-- Did you just say sister? Yeah. I have lunch with Gin every Thursday. What's the big? Maybe the fact that you have never mentioned that you have a sister? Yeah, I think I have, Grace. What do you think I'm talking about when I say, "Boy, do I love Gin"? Or, "I can't get through the day without Gin." Or, "That Gin gave me such a headache last night." I couldn't have been more clear. Sheesh. Next thing you know, you'll tell me you've never heard me mention my brother-in-law, Johnny Walker. Hey, look, I didn't want to say anything in front of Jack and Karen, but, I know what I'm going to name the baby George. After my dad? No, after the curious monkey. And by that I mean our President. Your dad He meant a lot to both of us, and I just thought it would be really nice if we honored him. Wow. I am so touched, but-- Are you sure you're comfortable doing that when you haven't even told Leo yet? Yes. Look. I dont even know how Leo is going to fit in the picture. I mean, Lord knows I've tried to get in touch with him. He's getting married. So, essentially, it's just you and me. And I want us to name him George. Thank you. I love that. Uh, what if it's a girl? Oh, I guess Boy George. Ah, Smitty. I think I'll have a martini. I'm meeting my sister for lunch today. I had a sister. But when the tornado came, we'd already boarded up the cellar door. She hung on to the pick-up as long as she could We found her top of the school. Ha! Smitty! What a story! I can just see her going 'round and 'round. Now I'm in the mood for something blended. Go on. Oh Anyway Ginny had an accident when we were children. I mean, nothing funny like your family, but You know, some people could have gotten very bitter, but not Gin. No. She's a brave gal. Just soldiers on as if nothing happened. Stop staring at me! What are you all looking at?! The freak whose left leg is three-eights of an inch shorter than the right? Gin, please, if they were looking at anyone, it was me. My boob popped out just before you got here. Apparently, it stayed out for quite some time. I only realized it when Smitty lifted it to get his tip. At least your boob doesn't to wear an orthotic. Well, uh Listen, Gin. You know how I've been supporting you for all these years? If you can call three hundred thousand dollars a month support. For the sake of argument, let's say we can. Now that Stanley and I are getting a divorce, I'm afraid that I won't be able to send you those checks anymore. I'm sorry. Say that again. I didn't hear you because one of my legs is shorter than the other. You're such a pessimist, Gin. Why not say, "One of my legs is freakishly long"? Hey, look who it is. Hi, Kare. This must be your sister, Virginia. Yes. Uh, Virginia, you remember me mentioning my friend, Jack. Wow. The resemblance is uncanny. Meaning, both of you have huge cans. I don't know, but something's different about you. From the way you're sitting, I'd say one of your legs is slightly shorter than the other. I knew a guy like that once. He died. Hey, come on, get out of here. We're having a private family discussion. Well, I'm family. Nothing would interest me more than-- Sweet Home Alabama, it's Josh Lucas! Here. Let me know how that works out for you. Oh, my God, I'm such a huge fan, I love your work. Okay, who do you think I am? Josh Lucas. Then thank you. That's the first time today. I've had three Matthew McConaugheys, two Aaron Eckharts, and a Thomas Jane, whoever that is. Oh, I know you. You're Jack McFarland. You play Chuck Rafferty on "The Badge." Why, I am and I do. But how would you know that? It hasn't aired yet. Yeah, I was up for that part. I'd do anything to get out of big-budget features and in to basic cable. I heard you blew everybody away, though. That's the story they're telling? Hey, we're having a premiere party tomorrow night. Why don't you come on by? Sure. Should I bring my girlfriend? If by "girlfriend" you mean "open mind to experimenting," then yes. Karen, If you think you're going to cut me off, think again, since we both know how I ended up like this. It was an accident! - Was it? - Gin, Please! Stop begging. No, I was ordering. Gin, Please! Please, you have to forgive me. I have no other choice. The question is can you forgive yourself for casting me out after leaving me so hideously deformed? Unable to dance To skip To read. Why can't you read? Eh, I don't want to. Okay, ready? One, two, three. Surprise. Wow. An empty room. Is the surprise that you're just not good at surprises? Remember that stroller I got from that drug gang? Turns out this is where they had their meth lab. Wow. This has been a fascinating edition of "NYPD Cribs". Why are we here? Because I want us to live together. Why are you such a bitch all the time? You want to move in together? Yeah, I want us to buy this place together. I can get it for a great deal. Yeah. It's got three bedrooms, a back yard. Look. Right now they're using it for-- Just don't look in the back yard right now. So what do you say? I say nothing would make me happier than to turn this humble little drug den into our home. I love you, Will. I love you. - Is that a basement? - Yeah, don't go down there. Wow. You really went all out for Jack's premiere party. I love that you put the posters up of "The Badge." Wait. Does that say "The Vadge"? Yeah That's the last time that I place an order with Kinko's over the phone. You know, maybe I should have said "B as in Boy" instead of "B as in Bagina". Yeah. It's unfortunate that the show's tagline is, "Go deep inside a hidden world that few dare to enter." Oh, my God, you guys. You're never gonna guess who's here. Me! I heard rumors that I wasn't going to show, but I'm really here. Thanks for my party, Karen, I really love it. Oh, honey, it was my pleasure. And it was easy. You know, I didn't even have to invite any of your friends, because they were already coming. - Say hello, boys. - Hi, Jack. Hey, Dalton. Hey, Mario. Thanks for coming to my big opening. Did that sound wierd? Thanks for making my opening so big. DALTON: We wouldn't miss it, Jack. MARIO: We're so proud of you. I can't believe that puffy queen got a TV show. I thought they cancelled "Fat Actress." You tell Grace the good news. I gotta go tell Jack something that happened at work today that'll make a great episode on "The Badge". Check it out. We actually had a stake out at a steak house. Come on, you can't make that crap up. What's the news? Vince and I found a place. It is a beautiful brownstone in Harlem and we're going to buy it! - Oh, my God. R-Really? - Yeah, it's perfect. It's even got one of those ironing boards that fold down from the wall. Oh A gay white man ironing in his Harlem brownstone. I can't wait for the neighbors to drop by. You know, to beat the piss out of me. So, you're moving. Grace. We're all moving. I figured the third floor would be just for you and the baby. Really? Oh, my God. This is so exciting. I just wanna say thank you for being here tonight. It really means a lot to me, and I know I've never said this to you before, but I love you. That means the world to me. I love you, too. What? Oh, no, I wasn't talking to you, dear. I was looking at myself in the reflection of your sunglasses to see what I'll look like when I talk to Josh Lucas. I'm so tired of falling in love with gay men. Hey. Glad you could make it, J-Lu. Hello, everyone. What are you all staring at? Me? Because I'm hideous? Well, all right. Let's get it out in the open. I've got a bum leg and I'm Karen's sister. Uh, Gin. What a surprise. What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you? I'm moving in. Since you refuse to continue with my meager monthly payments, this is all I can afford. Now. Let's talk about ramps. What's she bitchin' about? I got an uncle who lost a forehead in a towing accident. He's gotta wear a special hat to keep his brains in. Gosh, Gin, I'm not sure about you moving in. It might make Rosie feel very uncomfortable. She prides herself on being the toughest thing to look at around here. Do you hear that, everyone? My own sister is throwing me out on the street. And after what she did to me. Gin, please! Thanks. Gin, please! What? Are you afraid everyone will find out how you destroyed my life? It was a crisp, fall day. The country was still in shock over the assasination of the President. Okay, I'm 90% sure she's talking about Kennedy or Garfield. Father had just brought home a new game called croquet. Could be Garfield. Could be Lincoln. But Karen wanted to play Twister. Kennedy. Yes, I wanted to play Twister. And I'm so sorry. If there was any way I could take it back, I would. I mean, I'd still want to play. It's such a fun game. But I would play on a smooth surface, as recommended on the box. Where exactly did you play? The rickety old saw mill that juts out over the falls. Tell them, Karen. Tell them what happened when you called, "Right foot, red." They all know! You leap, you stretch, you balance, you twist. You try it once, you'll get the gist. But I didn't get the gist, did I? No. You fell. Through a rotted floor board. And broke my ankle. It healed badly and I never danced again. You danced? You bet your fat, pregnant ass I danced. Okay, now I see the family resemblance. I could have been on Broadway. You should have seen my moves. But because of her, I can't do that anymore! Oh, God, what I wouldn't give to see her dance one more time. I know. The big drama at the Poseidon premiere party was when Richard Dreyfuss karaoked the theme from Jaws and bit Goldie Hawn on the head. Hilarious! Kiss me. - What? - Nothing. Geez. Family? I tell you, my oldest sister's a nut, too. If she ever asks, we don't have that third bedroom upstairs. Well, we don't. That bedroom's for Grace. Oh, yeah. Well, of course. When she visits she can stay over. Vince, Grace is going to be living with us. With the baby. What are you talking about? When did this happen? Well, where did you think they were gonna be? I don't know. I didn't think it was going to be in our home. I made a commitment to her. You know that. Yeah, but I didn't think you committed us to living with her. Well, how else am I going to raise the baby with her? I just assumed you were okay with this. I'm not sure I am. Okay everybody. The show's about to start, alright. And remember you guys, one day, this could be you. But it's not today. So keep clearing. ANNOUNCER ON TV: Tonight on "The Badge" "JACK": Okay, scumbag. This is the end of the road, and you're out of gas. I'm Chuck Rafferty. And this is the last stop on this train. Check the overhead bins before I punch your ticket. Oh, my God. That's not my voice. I've been dubbed! Why would anybody dub my voice?! I thought I might find you here. What happened to the door? I'm a detective. I picked the lock. It's in two pieces. Yeah, I can't pick locks. I missed work the day they showed us because my skin was really dry. Look, I know I sprung the whole Grace thing on you, but we can work this out. How, Will? You've committed to raising a baby with her. How is this gonna work out? I know it's an odd situation, but I'm-- I'm good with odd situations. Like in high school, when all the guys were talking about what they'd like to do to Cheryl Tiegs. I said, "Braid her hair wet, make her sleep on it, and use a volumizer in the morning. Then nail her." See. If I can make that work, I can make this work. Will. I'm an old-fashioned homosexual. Okay? To me, family is two guys, some mid-century furniture, and a baby that doesn't look like either one of us. We can have all that. We can have both. No, we can't. What if our life takes us somewhere else? Will, what if we have to move to Seattle because of my eczema? How bad is your skin? You know what I'm saying. Well, I guess we wouldn't go. I mean, how-- how could we? I'm basically going to be this baby's father. Grace needs me. I need you. When are you going to stop playing house with this woman? That is not what I'm doing. When are you going to be happy living a life with just me? Are you asking me to choose? I'm afraid to, Will, because I think I already know the answer. Mo is me. Hey, guys. Don't worry, Jack. No one could tell you were dubbed. Really, Dalton? Absolutely. I hope so, but I don't know. People are smarter than you think. You mind if I sit down? I'm so embarrassed to have you see me like this, Josh Lucas. I mean, our careers were nearly identical until now. It's like you're Matt Damon, and I'm Ben Affleck and I just made Gigli. Or Paycheck. Or Bounce. Or Jersey Girl. Or Surviving Christmas. Look. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You wouldn't understand. No, look, I understand better than you think. Let me let you in on a little secret. This is my real voice. I've been dubbed my entire career. But how is that possible? I've heard you talk. You sound fine. Well, that because I've spent years taking voice lessons to sound like this. It's just that it's really hard for me to sustain for a long period of time. Time, time, time. Come on, lock it in, Josh. Lock it in. But You're so manly. I know. But all the top leading men are dubbed. Really? Well, what about the bottoms? Rosie. It looks like my sister is going to be staying with us for a while, and I don't want her to feel self-conscious, so, run off to the tool shed and shave three-eighths of an inch of the bottom of your foot. You let that woman walk unevenly all over you. It's time you told her the truth. I can't! You can't because you're weak! Oh, yeah? Does this feel weak to you? You know what, Rosie? Maybe you're right. Maybe I should tell her. what would I do widout my widdle Wo-Wo? I've got to stop falling in love with straight women. What are you all looking at? Not used to seeing somebody like me without a two-headed chicken and boy with lobster hands nearby? It's just you and me, honey. Oh. Well, in that case Wanna get a pizza and watch "Family Guy"? Sit down, Gin. I need to talk to you about your accident. Karen. You know I don't like to talk about that. I know, honey. But this is important. It wasn't an accident. I loosened that floor board underneath the Twister game because I was jealous of you. You were always daddy's favorite. He never even noticed me. He was always taking you to dance lessons and singing lessons. I had to stay home with Mom and learn how to bartend. Oh, Gin. Can you ever forgive me for what I did to you? I can because I also have a confession to make. You didn't cause my accident. Karen I didn't fall on "right foot, red." I fell on "left hand, green." - What? - That's right. I loosened that floor board so you'd fall through. I just got so caught up in the game, I forgot. Oh. It's easy to get caught up. You spin the spinner and call your spot. Twister will tie you up in a knot. And it's the perfect way to get rid of the sister that I was always jealous of. You were always popular, and easy going, and all the boys loved you. Well, honey, if they did like me more than you, it was only because I was kind and I listened, and I let them bang me under the bleachers while their friends watched. See, I always freeze up in a crowd. So, all these years, we both felt bad for nothing. And now we can be closer than ever. Aw, I'd like that. Will? Will?! What? What is it? Are you okay? You're never going to believe what just happened. I was on my way home from Dunkin' Donuts, and I stopped into McDonald's because I was starving. - And then I ran into - A Jenny Craig? The guy who was Leo's best man at our wedding. Remember? You said he was going to come out in two years. You were wrong, he went home with Jack that night. Anyway, he told that Leo called off his engagement with Kate. No, "huh". Great! Now-- Now he's single, and I know how to find him. What-- What, so have you called him yet? Oh, no, no, no. I don't want to call him. I mean, at this point, I don't think that this is something that I want to explain over the phone. So, I'm just going to get on the first flight to Rome. Rome? Oh, yeah, huh. Hello. That's where he's living now. He got some sort of research job at a hospital there. Wait, wait, wait. You're going to Rome? Is it even safe for you to fly? Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm good for-- I've got a few more weeks. Well, you're not going to be there for weeks. - Probably not. - "Probably" not? Well, I guess it, uh, depends on how it goes with Leo. Wait. So, you find out Leo cancelled his wedding, and you're on a plane to Rome within minutes? And you may be there for a while. Is that what you're telling me? I know it sounds crazy. But I know that he is still in love with me. Why else would he have called off his wedding? I gotta go. I've got to find out for sure. Beyond that, I don't-- I don't know what's going to happen. Well, uh How 'bout this? You go tell Leo that you're pregnant, then you fly back to New York, where we raise this baby together. Like we planned. What are you doing? Why are-- Why are you being like this? Wh-- I'm just trying to catch up, because suddenly, you're living in Rome with Leo and our baby. Our baby? Well. Yeah. The one you're naming after my father. Remember? Isn't that the way you told me to think about this child? I-- I know I have but, I mean, it's just-- I know, it's just that Leo, the guy who cheated you, is suddenly available, and you're gonna go running after him like some pathetic school girl! Do you have any idea what I have sacrificed for you and this baby?! Sacrificed? What? What do you mean? I just broke up with Vince! What?! Oh, my God, why? Because I wouldn't put him before my commitment to you. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but I did it. For you! Well, who asked you to? Excuse me? Will. Don't we-- Don't we want each other to be happy? I mean, if Vince makes you happy, you never should have left him. And if I have a possibility of being happy with Leo, you should want that for me, instead of making me feel guilty about wanting a relationship with the real father of my child. Well, tell me this, Grace If Leo cancelled his wedding for you, why hasn't he called? I can not believe you are doing this to me again! We're going to have a baby together, then Leo shows up, and I'm out of the picture. You know what? An hour ago, I put you first. Why was I stupid enough to think that you would ever do the same for me?! Will, I am not choosing between the two of you. Look. Okay, okay. Listen. We just need to breathe and just calm down here, okay? Nothing has even happened. Let's justlet's just start over, okay? Okay. Answer me this. If you're Rome, raising this baby with Leo Where am I? I don't know.   
                




                    			Okay. Answer me this. If you're in Rome raising this baby with Leo, where am I? I don't know. Well, you're gonna have to make a decision. - Grace! - What? Get out here, Warren's been suspended. Suspended again? What did he do this time? He wrote on the wall of the boys' bathroom, "Hey fellas, for a good time, call Will Truman." And what, you're pissed off 'cause no one's called yet? You think that's funny? You think it's funny that he disrespects his father like that? You're not my real dad. Hey, I gave up the love of my life to be your father. And I gave up the love of my life so he could be your father. Thanks, no wonder I'm so happy. Great, we're having guests over for game night any second, and I don't have time to reglue. All right, I'm outta here. - I'm going over to Sandoval's. - Oh, no, you're not. - You're not going anywhere. - Put down that coat. - Put down that hat. - Do not open that door. - Do not walk out that door! - Do not close that door! Are we too hard on him? You're not really gonna wear that, are you? Why, what's the problem with it? All the kids are wearing it. Yeah, and from what I can see, a bunch of them are in there with you. - Have another drink. - Have another doughnut. - Fag! - Hag! - Screw you. - You wish. You couldn't. Not because I'm gay because you're hideous. What do you want, time hasn't been nice to any of us. Hey, kiddles. Hi, honey. You-- Oh, I have got to remember to buy Kool-Aid. Karen, how do you look so fantastic? Oh, honey, come on. This is just Noxzema and the love of a good man. Where is your husband? Right behind me. Sorry we're late. Honey, you still have a little bit of my lipstick on your mouth. Do you wanna get it off? Yeah. I wanna get it off. I wanna get it off right now. Who else could use a drink? Come on, bring the game over here. We're gonna have a situation between Vampira and the Bride of Frankendyke. Dum-dum-da-dum, Step together step. Kick ball change, pas de bourré. And I'm married. Where did you get married, on the sun? That's funny, do you hear screaming? Oh, no, that's just the buttons on your shirt. Anyway, ready to meet my husband? Baby, get your cup-sized tushy in here! Hey, what's up? You married Kevin Bacon? Stalked him all the way to the altar. So, Kevin, how does it feel? You know, something is right, you just know it. I-I've never had so much clarity in my life. To love somebody, truly and forever, until God takes us. Either from old age or erotic asphyxiation. 'Cause you're hanging upside down, you got heels on-- Honey, honey and a scarf's tied around your neck-- What Oh, yeah, sorry. Sorry, sorry. Oharen't we all lucky to have found the one we truly belong with. The one who doesn't make us feel compromised or unhappy or like we're wasting away choking on misery and regret. Yeah, yeah, we get it, you're happy, we're not. Let's play the damn game. Grace, let's go. Bacon, keep score. No, I'm gonna have to skip this round 'cause I had my Kyra Forever tattoo lasered off, and I think it's starting to bleed. C'mon, c'mon, go, go. A shirt, a bed, your tummy and chin last summer. - Things that are tucked. - Right. - Uh, nuts, ice - More. Uh, our souls, our hopes and dreams. - Things that are crushed. - Yes. - Go on. - I can't go on. I can't go on either. Grace, being with you has ruined my life. What did you just say? Being with you has ruined my life. Grace, wake up. What did you say? I don't understand what you're saying. What? Grace, wake up. It's okay, it's okay. You were just having a bad dream. I was? I mean, you-- you kept saying bacon and huge ass. It's scary to finally make that connection, isn't it? What was it about? I don't remember. Who cares, it's just a dream. Right. Oh, good, it's still there. The relationship you have with the chicken is truly remarkable. I can't wait for the day someone inhales my leg and thigh like that. I don't know what to tell you, man. Jews and chicken it's real and it's deep. Hey, you know, I've been thinking about those bad dreams you've been having. I told you, I don't remember them. I think it's just stress about having a baby, you know? You're okay, right? I mean, about everything we talked about last week? What? Oh, yeah. Oh-- It's better I stayed. I'm glad we're doing this together. Okay, just go do the laundry 'cause I've been wearing your Calvin Klein boxers for the last three days. - They're briefs. - Not anymore. I'll be back in a minute. Would you like to hear a song? Yeah, Grace, could you do me a favor? Could you not sing to the baby anymore? Why? Music makes them smarter. Okay, well if you're gonna sing, have a glass of wine 'cause he--he's gonna want to be drunk for this. You like my singing, right? I believe the children are our future-- Guess what? Kicking turns up the volume. Teach them well and let-- I am not getting up again! Put the laundry down and open it yourself. Hello, Grace. Leo. Oh, you-- You're with a chicken, I'll go. No! What are you doing here? I thought you were in Rome. I was in Rome, but I came back because there was something I needed to say. There's something I need to say to you too. Grace, let me--let me just get this out first. Um, I was having lunch in the piazza the other day, and I look up from my soppressata panini-- that's Italian for bologna sandwich-- and, I see this really old couple holding hands and kissing. And, I mean, they were-- they were really going at it, you know, like in a way that you really don't ever want to see anybody kiss. And, um it--it-- it was just gross. And, uh, all I could think of was, umwas you. That--that is so not what I wanted that to sound like, um-- Grace, you told me to move on, and--and I tried. I tried, but I can't. And, um I guess, um I guess what I'm trying to say is, I want that old couple to be us, you know? I-I want to be gross with you. I can be gross. People tell me I'm gross all the time. Grace, I--I love you. I want to be with you forever. I want to marry you again. I want to have babies. I, um-- I'm getting ahead of myself, I know. Not really. Oh, my God It-- Isis? Oh, my God. You know, Ben, today is my birthday. Can you say, "My daddy is 25"? No? Okay. If you think I look 25, eat a Cheerio. Hey. Happy Birthday. I think I know what that is. I've been hinting at it all week. It's crocodile loafers from Gucci! Damn it. Oh, no, oh, no, Vince, wait. Whatever it is, I'm sure I'll love it. Of course it's loafers. What do you think, I'm an idiot? We wear the same size. Hi, who's my big boy? He's looking more like you every day. Really? I don't know. Sometimes I see me, and sometimes I just see the sad girl who sold her eggs for rent money. Anybody else call to say happy birthday while I was out with the baby? Grace didn't call, Will. She didn't call last year. She's not calling this year. You wanna talk to her, you gotta make the first move. Why should I? She--she's the one who-- All right, listen, what's the one thing you always said about you and Grace? I don't know. That we could reenact Grease in 17 minutes? What are you talking about? There's no way you could do Sandy's transformation from good girl to slut that quick. Look, you always said fate brought you together, fate was gonna keep you together. Ready, one  two three Okay, Daddy, don't get mad-- There you go! Ho, ho, ho Don't get mad, but, uh, somebody spilt-- Thank you. some baby oil inside your briefcase. Well, how could I be mad at somebody I love so much, huh? Good, 'cause it was me. And you blame it on Lila? I'm starting to think she's not the midnight farter. You know, maybe we should go upstairs and change the sheets 'cause somebody peed in our bed last night. Or did she? Yes, and I already changed them. Ready to go to the zoo? Let's go! Isn't there a phone call you should make first, Grace? Leo, are you going to do this every year? Give him a call, it's his birthday. Come on, he's your best friend. No. No, no, he's not my best friend. My best friend would've returned my calls when I left 100 messages begging for forgiveness. My best friend would've put aside his anger and showed up for the birth of my daughter. That's what my best friend would've done. So, let's put it all aside, and let's go to the zoo. Hey, who put the half-eaten chicken leg in my pocket? Give your daughter a break. It's deep and it's real. Hey, Jackie. Hey, Kare. What's the story, drunken whorey? Well, we need to do something to get Will and Grace back together. Honey, it's been almost two years. But why does it always fall on us to help those two? I know, poodle. You know, sometimes it seems like our sole purpose in life is just to serve Will and Grace. Right. It's like all people see when they look at us are the supporting players on the Will and Grace show. So, how to get Will and Grace in the same room Jackie, wait a minute. I just had an even better idea! What? Well, honey, I can't tell you over the phone. Oh, of course. Jack? Oh, buddy, I'm so sorry. Look, I want you to know I am there for you because I-I love you, buddy, and--and God knows I owe you so much. I mean, you were the one that helped me come out. You know, so anything I can do-- Back off, fruitcake. Sorry, I thought you were my friend. Well, I'm not, pickle biter. Leviticus 20:13 says if a man lies with another man as he does with a woman, he's an abomination-- All right, shut up! It's obviously been a mistake. I don't know why they sent me in here. - Karen. - Grace. Will. If you're looking for Jack, that's not him. Jack? I thought it was Karen. Jack told me that she was-- No, no, Karen told me that Jack was-- We just fell for the dumbest version of Parent Trap ever. God, I, um I don't know what to say. Happy birthday? Thank you. I don't suppose you have time for a piece of cafeteria cake? Sure, I could do that. Remember, the Lord said that blood will be upon all the homosexuals, and they will surely feel the-- Call me? Honey, you know what I love about our plan to pay off a nurse to direct Will and Grace to the hospital room of a total stranger in a full-body cast whose face is covered in bandages, each one of them thinking it's one of us in that bed with our bones broken? What? The simplicity. We have so much to celebrate, Kare. Will and Grace are making up as we speak, you got a huge divorce settlement. Hey! Let's get a dessert! Nothing too filling something small and fruity with ladyfingers. Well, well, well. Karen Walker, in the flesh. Whose flesh is unclear. Why, Beverley Leslie. What are you doing later tonight, honey? I'm having a few friends over for a game of Monopoly and I'm missing one of the pieces. Excuse me, Mrs. Walker. There's a question about your credit card. Can I speak to you privately for a moment? My credit card? Oh That's probably just Marlo Thomas getting me back for the time that I made Driver poop in her kitty litter box. Excuse me a moment. Yeah. Nice seeing you again. I'm sure you have places to go. A magic ring to protect. You may or may not know this, but my business associate Benji and I have come to a parting of the ways. And I thought you two would last forever. You were definitely the most stable in-the-closet, short-tall, black-white, young-old, disgusting-hot couple I know. The point is, I'm looking for a new business associate. Maybe you might be interested. Uh, no, thanks. And I think your car is here. You think about it, and remember I've got millions. Come on, Karen, let's go. It's over, Jackie. It's all gone. What is? What are you talking about? I just got off the phone with my accountant. Turns out, everything Stan had was borrowed. So, my divorce settlement is worthless. Honey, I'm broke. Oh, Will, Ben is so adorable. I can't wait to meet him. He's clearly Will's child. Fat, bald, and clinging to Vince like it's the only man who'll ever love him. Oh, he is a little pudge ball. Lila was so skinny her whole first year. - What'd you feed her? - The boob. Portion control. Smart. Would you look at us? Will's mean, Grace is flat-chested Jackie's pretending like he's following this. And I'm high from something I found under the sink in your bathroom. The gang is back. It's like nothing changed. Well, not everything's the same. Karen here has lost her-- Virginity. Jackie, I don't want to talk about my money problems tonight. You know who Lila looked exactly like when she was born? My mother right after she gets out of the sauna. I can't believe you haven't met her. I would have loved to, but, you know, you kinda went to live in Rome for a year, so-- Will, you know that I wanted you to be a part of Lila's life. You could have come at any time. Oh, right. I'm just supposed to drop everything and fly to Rome to meet your baby? Well, you did drop everything to fly to London to see Billy Elliot. Billy Elliot lived up to its promise. And we're back. God. God forbid that you should let go of your anger. Hey, I had reason to be angry. You never gave me a chance to explain-- - Nothing you would have said-- - Well, then, what's the point? Hey, I gave up everything for you! I know! Look. I had the chance to be with the love of my life and I took it. And I am-- I am glad I did. I mean, just think what would have happened if I hadn't. We would still be in this apartment. You would end up bald with some horrible toupee. I'd have a giant ass packed into a red track suit. Karen would be frenching Rosie. And Jack would be married to Kevin Bacon. That is oddly specific. I am so sorry I hurt you, Will. But I'd be lying if I said I regret what happened. And I don't think you do, either. If you could go back and change things, I don't believe that you would. God, you're right. Grace, I don't want to fight with you anymore. I don't, either. I just want us to be us again. I do, too. Do you find them exhausting? I always have. Ooh! Hey, I have a funny story to lighten the mood. It's totally unrelated to your situation. I wish there was something I could do to help you with your money problems. Anyway, guess who offered to share their entire fortune with me? Beverley Leslie. You and Beverley Leslie I think we've actually found someone you're too butch for. Anyway, isn't that funny, Kare? Beverley wants me so bad he's willing to give me all his money. I can't What? I think it's time for us to go. Jack has told his hilarious story and you're out of vodka. There's a bottle right there. Nope, empty. Jackie, let's go! Do you find them exhausting? Always have. Isn't that funny that Beverley would proposition me like that? I mean, why on earth would I ever take him up on it, no matter how much money he offered me? Karen, you accidentally hit the stop button with your shoe. And you accidentally smashed my face into the wall. Now you listen to me, you sissified little hippity-hop! I've got nothing and that miniature pony offered you all his money just to take a few rides on him and you said no? But I don't like him. - Since when is that a problem? - Well played. I can't do it. Oh, you'll do it. You'll do it the same way any other self-respecting woman does. Get on your back, point your heels to Jesus, and think of handbags. Oh, my God. What? I didn't even go in there. You're washing dishes. And you're using a sponge instead of your tongue. I-- I don't think I've ever seen you do that before. Well, I guess when you're a mom, you learn to do things like that. You're probably just gonna rewash them when I leave anyway. No, I won't. The kitchen's kinda Vince's domain now. - Really? - Yeah. - I'm impressed. - Yeah, me too. - I think we've grown. - I think we have. So, did you like the risotto? Did I tell you we're having-- Oh, I'm sorry-- I thought you were allergic-- - Oh-- Oh, you-- - You would-- Oh. We're a little rusty. Yeah. Well, you know, it's been a couple Yeah. You know what this Let's go to a movie. How about tomorrow night? Thursday's are bad 'cause Leo's on call. How about Friday? Yes. No-- No, we, um-- We bought a little cabin in the Berkshires. And we drive up every Friday afternoon. Yeah. Okay, um, how about, uh, Memorial Day? No. We're in Flushing with my in-laws. Okay. Um, you know what? We'll just call each other. We'll figure it out. Of course we will. Okay. - I'm not worried. - Me, neither. - Well, yeah, we should - Okay. Gracie, it was so good to see you. It was. Really, justit was. What, you don't-- You don't like the changes that we made? No, no, it's not that. It's just I just don't live here anymore. Bye, Will. Bye, Grace. Oh, this is so much fun! I love when we play Baby Beverley. Yeah Oops, baby go boom. Now you stop being such a tease. It is time for us to consummate this union. I'm going to go put in a "Magnum P.I." rerun to get in the mood. But before I leave, how about a kiss? All right, close your eyes. Hey, honey. What's up? Oh, nothing. I'm not desperately trying to get hobbit germs off my kissing hand, if that's what you're thinking. So what brings you by? You need a little more cash? Maybe. But first, could you settle a bet for me? Nosy Rosie over here said that you may not be happy in your current situation with Beverley. - I'm so glad you brought that up. - Good, honey. Now tell her that you're just really happy that you can take care of me the same way that I took care of you for all those years. He does look happy. He has the same smile on his face that I had when you fit me with that electric shock collar. Go wait in the car. Well, Jackie Is it true? Are you unhappy? Well, I don't know, Karen. I mean, can you be happy sharing a bed with a man who douses himself in lavender and insists on being your eye pillow? Or makes you wear a prairie skirt whenever he wants to play General Store and Sundries? Or won't let you open the terrace doors to let you scream because he's afraid a gust of wind will blow him off the balcony? Sounds good to me, honey. Yeah, great. So listen-- Could I get my weekly allowance from you? I know you gave me $100,000 this morning, but it goes quick at the $99,000 store. I'm horny! I can't let you do it, Jackie. Oh, it's okay. Like you said, if you could do it with Stan, I can deal with Beverley. It's exactly the same situation if you turn your binoculars around. No, it's not the same, Jackie. I loved Stanley. Honey, I can't ask you to do this with somebody that you don't love. Thank you, Karen. But what am I going to tell Beverley after he just made me the sole beneficiary of his vast fortune? I know--I'll leave him a note on his booster seat. Jack? Are you hiding? You naughty boy. You're not out there on the balcony, are you? You know I'm frightened to go out there. Well maybe it's not that windy. Whoo! It's a little blustery. Well, well-- Weeeellllll! Oh, look at this. Teri Hatcher buys her own produce. That's normal. Well, look at this. Nicole Richie sleeps in a wire basket. That's not normal. Hey, where are you? Oh, um I was just thinking about what you said the other day. About Grace and I always saying we were destined to meet. It's weird, you know. We always felt like there was something bigger going on. Fate brought us together and fate was gonna keep us together. I even remember back in college Will saying, "It's destiny." And I totally agreed. Of course, I was trying to get laid. Aren't you supposed to cover my ears when you say something like that? We're just, you know-- We just just really clicked. And we knew it the minute we met that first day at orientation. Our rooms were right across the hall from each other. And I swear, we were never apart. But now I think it's over. It just feels like a closed chapter. It's strange that I would even think that way. You know? Destiny? There's no destiny. People come into your life randomly. And they leave randomly. You can't force it. That's just how things happen. Destiny is just something for young people to believe in. Is that true, Lila? You believe in destiny, Ben? - Hi. - Hi. This is a Tempur-Pedic pillow. I have a neck thing. This is abox of bras. I have boobs. They're not much, but they're mine. - Well Bye. - Bye. I was just, um-- I know what you were doing and it's a little embarrassing for ya? Why is it embarrassing for me? 'Cause I caught you poking your head out to get another look at me. I wasn't trying to get another look at you. Oh. 'Cause that's what I was doing. Yeah, I was too. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Ben. - I'm Lila. You wanna get a cup of coffee or something? Oh, well, my mom's gonna be back any second with some stuff for my room. Yeah, so is my dad. We leave now, we can miss 'em. Let's go. Come on, Ben. Hurry up. This is heavy. Lila? Open the door. It's your mother. - Is that you? - Is that you? I think so. - Don't turn around. - Why not? Do you have your hair? I do, thank God. Have you had anything lifted? - I haven't. - Why not? I knew you were gonna say that. Count of three. Onetwothree. You look good. Thank you. You don't look anything like your mother. Oh, thank you. This is so weird. Our kids going to the same school. And across the hall, like-- I--I know. Wanna go get a piece of cafeteria cake? Oh, uh, Lila's expecting me any minute. Yeah, so is Ben. If we go now, we can miss 'em. Let's go. You look good. Did you get a little touch-up today? Did they tighten around your-- Oh, yeah. And did they smooth out your-- Went in through the ear. Oh, she's up. I'll go get her. She might wanna eat! Oh, are we hungry? Does somebody need something to eat? I just broke my ankle, you douche bag. I'm not an infant. Somebody cwanky. Maybe she woke up from her nap too soon. Why don't you go pick out a book. Maybe I can teach ya a few words of English tonight, huh? Suck it, bitch. No idea what she just said. She's aging so gracefully. - Jack? - Yeah? What do you wanna do tonight? Oh, I don't know. Stay in? Oh, that sounds nice. - Jack? - Yeah? How long have we been living together? Uh, about 20 years. Why? Isn't it funny how we've been with each other longer than we were with any of our husbands or boyfriends? I guess it is. I never thought about it before. - Jack? - Yeah? I think I feel a song coming on. Then a song we shall have. And might I say your knockers are looking particularly full tonight. And might I say you have the balls of a 30-year-old. Unforgettable That's what you are. Unforgettable Though near or far Like a song of love That clings to me How the thought of you Does things to me Never before Honey, has someone been more Unforgettable In every way And forever more That's how you'll stay That's why, darling It's incredible That someone Sounforgettable Thinks that I am Unforgettabletoo. - What are you doing? - Watching TV. Me, too. I'm so glad George Clooney came back to "ER." And I'm having second thoughts about the dress. My dress or Lila's wedding dress? Yours. I'm not crazy about the trim. Will, you never were. I still can't believe our kids are getting married. I can. I'm paying for it. You know, for me, that's the most special part about this whole experience. Hey, Vince is working. What--what are you doing? You wanna meet for a drink? Yeah. Leo's working, too. Where? Let's go to that bar where they made us kiss that time when they thought we were married. Why, you gonna try something? If you play your cards right. Call Jack and Karen. Tell them to meet us there. I will. Don't wear the gold coat. First of all, I'm not. And second of all, I wouldn't listen even if I were. On three? - One, two-- - Wait. Uh, why'd you stop me? I was gonna say, "Three, four, slam it, whore." Come on, the glass is clean. No. I was gonn a propose a toast to family. Family that loves you and accepts you for exactly who you are. - Boring. - Too real. You know what's funny. We haven't changed a bit. It's kinda nice, isn't it?

We are.  Okay, good. Now let's book our train.  Are we comfortable in business, or should we be bad  and splurge for first?  Let's be bad!  I mean, if we're gonna do it, let's do it.  Okay, and we're done.  Thank you for booking your travel through "One Fine Gay."  Karen, I need to Karen?  Hey, Grace. She's not here yet.  Hey, Tony. You're in early.  - Hi. - Yeah, you know,  I was just finishing up the drawings on the townhouse.  You are so good. Mm.  Hey, Tony, can I ask, um,  does Karen ever offend you?  Mrs. Walker, offend me? Um  [STAMMERING] Well, I mean, she's like  [CHUCKLING] You know, she's like I mean  well, what do you mean by "offend"?  Does her politics offend you?  Politics? No, no.  Is there anything else that she does that offends you?  [LAUGHING] Mrs. Walker? Uh  you know, she's she's it's kinda like [CHUCKLES]  I mean [STAMMERS]  nah, she doesn't offend me, no.  Well, you let me know if she does.  I will. Thank you.  That stuff looks great.    Karen, you and I need to have a very serious talk.  Oh. So, I shouldn't do this?  Honk.  I'd prefer you didn't.  How about this? Honk-honk.  - No. - No.  How about the Sugar Ray speed bag?  - [IMITATES PUNCHING IMPACTS] - Karen!  Sorry, honey, but you make me nervous  when you do the serious face and your mouth goes  into that little balloon knot.  I'm instating a new rule.  Your politics, your business,  but you gotta keep it out of the office.  Honey, I knew I had some news.  You're redecorating the Oval Office!  - What? - What?  What? What? What?  What?  The Oval Office?  Yeah, Melania called me last night  after one of her night terrors.  She said the hubster's been pouting  'cause his office is a real dump.  [GIGGLING] So, I says to her I says,  "Melani-o, have I got the decorator for you."  And she says, "Is she pretty?"  And I says  "Not a threat."  So, long story short, we're going to Washington.  Wait a minute, you got me a job  redecorating the Oval Office?  Yes, you.  I I  [SIGHS] Well, obviously, I wouldn't even consider it.  But just out of curiosity, what is he looking for?  Just a fluff. You know, he wants it  to look like he's there from time to time.  No, I can't.  It would be completely hypocritical.  I know that this is a huge opportunity,  but it goes against everything that I believe in.  I would hate myself if I took that job.  - Train leaves at 10:30. - I'll be there at 10:15.    I gotta say, when you're actually here,  it's kind of hard to be cynical.  I mean, the Oval Office is right there.  And look, there's the vegetable garden  where Michelle Obama introduced broccoli to the Midwest.  And that right there, that's where  Joe Biden and Barack Obama used to hold hands  - and talk about their dreams. - Aww.  I still don't get how you got us in here.  My pals at the Secret Service.  You don't know anybody in the Secret Service.  Of course I do. Everybody in the Secret Service  is gay. You know that.  Why do you say things like that?  Because it's true. Who better to read a room?  You're ridiculous.  Sir, you are aware that we can hear  everything you're saying. Slandering the Secret Service  Oh, oh please, please forgive him.  He he was born with his brain on the outside of his skull.  Was I speaking to you?  Oh no, no. I beg your pardon.  - It's my first time. - I was speaking to him  this adorable marzipan confection  with a tushy that belongs in the Smithsonian.  Hey, Lenny. Long time.  Good to see you, angel face.  Glad you guys got in. Your skin is amazing.  You obviously take good care of it.  Find me later.  [INDISTINCT CHATTER]  There he is. There's the congressman.  Is that Will Truman?  [BREATHLESSLY] Hi. Kellyanne Conway, he's hot!  [QUIETLY] Mm-hmm.  Okay, he's a ten, you're a six.  Be confident, okay?  - And don't giggle. - I'm a grown man.  I don't giggle.  Congressman Sandoval, it's an honor.  The honor is mine. I serve at the pleasure  of my constituents  hopefully one in particular.  - [GIGGLING] - [THWACK]    Wow.  I've gotta say, I am awed  by the majesty of this office.  I mean, just think of the great minds that sat at this desk  and shaped the course of history.  A Russian-English dictionary and a fidget spinner.  The first time I was in this office,  Nancy and I were chasing Ronnie around that desk  Trying to get some protein into the ol' Gipper.  We used to put a scoop of tuna fish  in an ice cream cone and tell him it was mint chip.  All right, let's start.  Karen, hand me that curtain swatch.  I need to make sure it works with his coloring.  - Yup, that's the one. - Ah.  Paige, please give Mr. Truman here a tour of the West Wing.  Oh, Congressman, before I give anyone a tour  of the West Wing, there is a security protocol  that I have to what the hell?  Rules don't mean anything in this place anymore.  - I'll go get your credentials. - Thank you.  Hup-up-up-ah!  What's with the Laura Bush pour?  Give me the full Pat Nixon!  Uh, excuse me.  - What's going on out there? - That's the Energy Caucus,  ma'am. Congressman Sandoval is about  to address them in the Rose Garden.  That's that awful guy that Will's been writing.  He's rolling back environmental regulations.  Ha! Take that, trees and water.  You know they make gin out of trees and water.  Eh, rich people won't be affected.  Oh, now I just feel gross.  I'm here doing this,  and Will's off somewhere, resisting.  [SPITS]  We'll meet back here afterwards.  Sure.  We'll start in the Oval Office,  But you should know,  the owner's got someone in there redecorating.  "The owner"?  There's a lot of new words they want us to use.  Follow me.  Hmm redecorating for this president?  [SNORTS] What desperate fool would take that job?  It's just gonna be redone in a year.  [THUD]  Actually, you could say my job's gotten a lot easier.  The nutjobs that we protected the last president from  are this guy's biggest supporters.  Oh, yeah.  Enough about me. What about you?  - What's going on? - Oh, God.  [STAMMERS] The, um, last time I saw you,  I was living in the apartment across the hall from Will,  you know, kind of  doing a journey inward.  Yeah, I was still doing that ridiculous one-man show.  No, I remember that. Right, it was called "Just"  Don't even!  That is dead to me!  What kind of an ego must I have had  to put my own name in the title of my show?  Anyway, since then, I've started  a bunch of different businesses.  Oh, yeah? Like what?  Well, I had an energy drink  called "Jack It Up!"  Then I was gonna trademark  my own stretch and kick workout,  called "Jack be Nimble."  But I strained my groin  doing an overly enthusiastic demonstration  on top of one of the investors.  After that, then I started  a Halloween pumpkin carving business.  Ah, let me guess. "Jack-O'-Lanterns."  That's what I should've called it.  Not "Scary Orange Balls"!    Welcome to the Oval Office.  The owner would like you to know it's  the best Oval Office you'll ever see.  - It's tremendous, and - Grace.  - Will. - You and I need to talk.  I disagree. I think you and I need to talk.  What are you doing here, Grace?  What are you doing here, Will?  Are you just gonna repeat everything I say  with an emphasis on a different word?  Are you just gonna repeat everything I say  with an emphasis on a different word?  I can't watch another husband and wife fight  - in this office. - [MURMURS INDISTINCTLY]  I saw Barb Sr. give 41 the full pile driver  in this office over that "read my lips" BS.  Come on.  - How could you? - [SCOFFS] What?  I'm an interior designer, just designing an interior.  It's a room.  What you are doing is so much worse.  Me? I'm just here voicing  my grievances in person.  Before or after giggling like a schoolgirl  with Congressman Sandoval in the Rose Garden?  Who are you, Mrs. Peacock in "Clue"?  Don't try to distract me with a movie you know I love.  You had me convinced that you were actually  doing something selfless, when all you were doing  was just trying to pull an Anderson Cooper!  How do you know what an Anderson Cooper is?  [SCOFFS] You're not the only one in the house  who reads Queerty.  Don't you understand  that working here is a tacit endorsement  of everything that happens here?  I can't believe you'd even consider  taking this job. Honestly,  I'm more disappointed than anything.  Oh, unbelievable.  Even though you are totally busted,  you are still acting superior to me!  - Can't do this again. - Do what?  This us being all up in each other's stuff.  Well, then why did you beg me to stay with you?  I begged? [STAMMERS LAUGHINGLY]  You stood at my doorstep with a suitcase!  [IMITATING GRACE'S SOBS] "I. Don't. Know.  Where. To. Go, Will!" [SNORTS]  [GASPS] Whoa!  If you're so unhappy, then move out,  because I can't live with your crazy again.  Do not call me crazy.  That's real mature. What are what, what are we,  gonna have a pillow fight in the Oval Office?  Classic Grace: act and then think.  You're right. Let me think first.  Hmm.  Do that again  I dare you.  That's it! It's on!  [THWACK]    I mean, now, I'm actually living  in the apartment across the hall from Will.  Um, you know, kind of doing a journey inward.  So  a lot has changed.  -  Oh-ba-da, bi-ba-da  - Kare?  Poodle? What are you doing here?  I'm on a date.  With Lenny?  Wait a minute, you two know each other?  Well, hello, Mrs. Walker.  - Pleasure as always. - Yes.  - What have you been up to? - Recently,  I've been focusing my attention  Excuse me.  All available agents,  we have a situation in the Oval.  Cupcake Daddy's gotta work.  Little kiss?  I'm in the middle of a crisis.  [STAMMERS, SIGHS]  Oh, those eyes are just too damn blue.  So did you get serviced?  Shh.  It's a secret.    [KEYS JINGLING]    [DOOR THUDS CLOSED]  - Hey. - Hey.  You're really leaving, huh?  Yup.  I was gonna go to a hotel, but  - You're too cheap? - Yup.  Then I was gonna go to my sister's, but  - She was eating on the phone? - Yup.  [SIGHS] So  I guess I will go.  Grace, Grace [STAMMERS]  You know why I didn't tell you what I was doing?  I didn't want you to think less of me.  I didn't want you to think less of me, either.  I like you thinking that I'm a better person  than I really am, 'cause it  makes me wanna be a better person.  And your judgey-ness  keeps me from doing  some of the crazy things I wanna do.  So stay. And not not just temporary.  I mean, as long as it makes sense.  - It'll be different this time. - Will it?  Yes. 'Cause all the other times  we've done this, we thought it would be different,  but this time, we know it's gonna be exactly the same.  And that's what makes it different.  And I'm the crazy one?  Mm-hmm.  - Oh, yeah. - Mm.  Come on, let's get you back to your room.  There's nothing in here, is there?  I kinda figured we'd end up here.    Because of you guys,  I had to spend the night at the White House.  The things I had to do to Lenny to keep you two out of trouble!  Thanks, you guys.  When you two talk about politics,  you get so preachy.  We should just be what we've always been.  - Mm-hmm. - A sad, middle-aged lady  And Grace.  Oh, Grace. I can't believe  you had a chance to redecorate the Oval Office  - and you blew it. - I don't know.  I did manage to make one little change.  [JAZZY PATRIOTIC MUSIC]

Go, go, go!  Do not tell her.  Your secret is safe with me.  And Grace. So, last night,  Jack and I were at the Cockpit.  He's hitting on this 20-something who says  this is the good part  Oh, daddies love me.  [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]    [GASPS]  [IN BABY-TALK] I'm sorry.  Really, Grace?  Peekaboo sleeves?  Aren't you begging someone to just peek and then boo?  Oh, so this other young guy  starts hitting on me  I hope this doesn't weird you out,  but I think you're really hot.  [LAUGHS]  You're like an anchorman.  This just in: Aww.  Oh, you're sweet. Okay, I think I need to know  everything about you, okay? What's your behind-the-music?  What's your unsolved mystery? What's your "E! True Hollywood Story"?  Well, my name's Will.  I'm a partner in a law firm. Grew up in Connecticut  Oh, my God! Do you know this song?  Wait, I'm so sorry. I'm the rudest.  I have no words, ADHD   Hey, come on.  I'm sorry, Jack. I guess some people  age like an anchorman  and others like a meth-head mother of nine.  To reiterate, anchorman.  Meth-head mom.  I used to love the Cockpit.  Remember how they used to play  "Designing Women" on a loop, and then we'd applaud  after Dixie Carter's speech?  [TOGETHER] "And that is the night  the lights went out in Georgia!"  [LAUGHS]  Why'd I stop going?  Oh, I remember.  I got tired of you introducing me  as your drag queen friend,  "Judy Ism."  Mm. I didn't.  Anyway, it's probably not a great time to tell you  that I'm seeing that 23-year-old tonight.  His name's Blake. It's cute, right?  It's not cute. You're not cute.  Look, I just didn't want you to have to read about it  in the monthly gay newsletter.  You know, that a really young  Did I mention he's 23? I think I did.  Anyway, seeing him tonight.  Blake.   I want you both out of the apartment by the end of the day.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]     [COMPUTER VOICE] Steam on.  Ah!  Oh, brava!  That alone was worth the 100 grand.  Steam off.  Begging you pardon, Mum.  Smart shower, what happened to your voice?  It's me, Bridget, Mum.  Oh, Lord.  Thought the Lucky Charms leprechaun  had crawled up into that thing.  [SIGHS]  Rosario sent me up.  I'm here to represent the staff.  We'd like a raise.  Give me a break, Mrs. Potato Head.  Rosario said, "Don't leave until the woman  pays us what we're worth."  Did she call me the A-word, the B-word, or the C-word?  Yes, Mum.  Even a small raise would make us feel valued,  and to give us a shred of dignity.  Let me think on it.  [MUTTERING]  [MUTTERING] Have a bill, trade a fish,  Cayman Islands, take a plane,  that'd cost [MUTTERS INCOHERENTLY]  Switzerland mmm  [MUTTERING]  Carry the four, write it off,  I'm still rich, deal.  You tell Rosario  that you and the staff can have your raise.  Thank you, Mum.  Everyone deserves a little dignity.  On your way down, there's some dried puke in the library.  And find out who's been reading.  - Hi, Bridget. - Oh, hi, Jackie.  Shame about what happened to you  at the Cockpit last night.  How does Bridget know about my humiliation?  Someone in the house must have told her.  You were the only one who knew.  [PLAYFULLY] I'm the someone.  Oh, come on, Jackie. I knew just what to do.  In here, you will find everything you need  to make father-time your bitch.  Let's start with this little number,  "Scro-tox."  It's like Botox, but for the boys.  One drop of this, and your old man balls  will seem like two shiny pink marbles.  Wait, wait, wait. Will they still be able to show a range of emotions?  Well, they won't be able to look surprised, so let's move on.  Here we have the world's strongest magnets.  One goes here, one goes here.  Guaranteed to take the Mitch McConnell out of anyone's neck.  Wow.  Finally, science is good for something.  Mm-hmm.  Now, let's get this Pillsbury Dough-body  back into its tube.  Here we have  a full-body compression garment.  For a fat baby?  For my fat baby.    Borderline   Feels like I'm going to   Will, just table-scape or don't.  [KNOCKING ON DOOR]  Pushing my love   Over the borderline   - Hey. - Hi.  - You look great. - So do you.  Glad I flossed.  I told you that was the move.  Who's that?  That's Stella. She's my best friend.  Yeah, we live together now,  but how long is that going to last?  You'd be surprised.  And he's cute.  Looks like my dad.  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  [AWKWARD SCUFFING]  [METALLIC CLANG]  Stupid magnets.  Ah!  Hello.  Is this seat taken?  [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]    [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  Okay, I got your text.  When did we agree that you could summon me  with a dreidel and a jar of horseradish?  And when did they start making "emojews?"  Oh, I just wanted to thank you  for redoing my shower.  You've really gone above and beyond,  and I just wanted to say that  I want a raise.  You mean a mood elevator?  No, honey, a raise raise.  I've been working for you a long time,  and that's what people do.  A raise would show that that you value me.  You don't need a raise.  You're in the top 1% of income  and blood alcohol level.  It's not my fault that people can't marry money and hold their liquor.  Give me one good reason why I don't deserve a raise.  You don't do anything!    What's your name?  Lincoln. My mom named me  after our country's greatest car.  You look like a car in need of a jack.  Allow me to intro-seduce myself.  I'm Jack.  - And I think I'm falling for you. - Oh!  Let me get, uh, some wine, and I thought I'd make dinner.  Oh, you cook?  That's so throwback Thursday.  Wow. Are these candles Goop?  I feel like I'm on "The Bachelor."  Well, you know gays and our disposable income.  Didn't have kids, but I raised some very well-adjusted linen pillows.  [LAUGHS]  Are you sad about that?  I am now.  Mm. Isn't Madonna kinda tired?  I don't know about "tired."  I mean, it is a pretty great song.  Got me through a bad break-up in '94.  I was born in '94.    I thought we had an understanding.  You don't do real work,  and I don't pay you a real salary.  Grace, I am getting a little steamed.  Steam on.  You put the steam on? I told you  not to program it yourself.  You wouldn't even have a business without me.  That is so untrue.  Why are the jets so low?  How about all the clients I brought you?  Are you saying that you  that you don't need me?  Why are we doing this, Karen?  - Just say it. - I'm not gonna say it.  - Say it. - I don't need you.  That is it. We're done.  You won't hear another word. I am locking it up.  Shower locked.  What just happened?  Locking it up forever!  - Stop talking. - Oh, sorry I've been such a drain.  Guess I'll just shut up.  Drain shut.  No, no, no!  Oh, we are at war!

Go!  These stupid magnets! Oh!  [METALLIC CLANK]  - Gah! - [CLANK]  - Okay, I'm going to need these back. - Oh!  On second thought, keep them.  Jack, Jack, Jack, wait.  Is Grace right?  Is it creepy that I'm dating a 23-year-old?  - We're not really connecting. - So what?  They're young and hot, we're old and not.  Nothing else matters.  He doesn't like Madonna.  He should be beaten with a VHS copy of "Evita."  We need this.  You're right. Okay.  Okay. You're good?  - Great. And you're good? - I'm I'm great.  - It's not weird? - It's not weird. Age is a number.  - Exactly. Who cares how old he is? - Nobody. Who cares  if I'm going to put a full face of makeup on right now?  - What? - The first time I met him,  it was dark, and I had a hat on.  - Jack, you don't need makeup. - I told him I was 25.  Work from the neck up  and keep the lights low.    How do we shut this thing off?  You know that I panic in small spaces.  Oh, yeah? Then you might want to rethink those knit pants  you were wearing on Monday. [LAUGHS]  Who programs "lock it forever"  into a shower?  Oh, come on, Grace.  Like you and Will have never tried  to spice up your lovemaking  with a night of danger games.  Oh, my God, honey, that's it!  That's it!  The shutoff code  is Stan and my safe word!  Oh! Oh, oh.  Thank God!  What's your safe word?  [LAUGHS]  I can't remember.  How could you not remember your safe word?  Well, honey, I've never used it.  Takes a lot for this little lamb chop  to feel unsafe.  It's [GASPS]  It's happening. It's happening.  [GASPS] I can't breathe.  [INHALES] I can't breathe!  I'm back at Camp Rabat,  trapped under a canoe,  and the counselor is saying, "Where is she?"  And Janet Eisenberg is saying,  "Who cares? It's just gross Adler."  [SOBS]  Karen, please! Think!  What was the verkakte safe word?  Well, I know it's something  that really kills the mood for me sexually  Oh, oh! Sobriety!  No  Hillary Clinton!  Oh, that's actually kind of a turn-on.  Well, for me, my coming-out  was pretty typical.  My mom cried, my dad drank,  and my grandmother got rabies.  Unrelated, but just a rough weekend all around.  That's brutal.  Yeah. How was it for you?  Oh, um I told my parents  I was gay when I was eight. They were divorced.  They both threw me a coming-out party  on the same weekend.  That was hard.  That's not a coming-out story.  How's James Franco supposed to win the Oscar playing that?  God, is that the new gay?  You guys grow up in a big happiness bubble?  - Isn't that good? - No. It's so nice,  it's practically abuse.  I mean, how's it supposed to get better  if it was always fine?  Are you mad at me because I'm happy?  Yes.  No, I  Probably. Doesn't matter.  Older guys are so dramatic.  Which is super-hot   Does this pull out?  Actually, I have a whole bedroom.  To yourself?  Here's something that will blow your mind:  I got my own sheets and pillowcases, too.  Just curious: Um when you said,  "Older guys are dramatic," what do you mean?  Well, you just you make a big deal about everything.  You realize the happy life you have  is because we made a big deal about things?  Yeah, Will, I know all about Stonehenge.  Do you mean Stonewall?  I'm actually not quite sure what either one is.  Do you seriously, seriously, not know?  Who cares? So I'm not a history puff.  Okay?  That was a kabillion years ago, okay?  - Everything's good now. - "Who cares"?  Dude, I don't mean to be rude,  but my boner has already called a Lyft.  Okay? Either we're going to hook up,  or you're going to give me a lecture.  You're right.  You're right. And the choice  is obvious.  The history of our people is a rich and complex tapestry.  - [KNOCKING] - Come in!  Jack?  Oh, hey, Lincoln. How are you? I'm over here.  Can I turn on a light?  Oh, no, no, no, uh, uh  Follow the sound of my youthful voice.  All right. I made it.  [CLAPS TWICE]  We were everywhere!  Art, culture, business, politics.  We rightly took Halloween back from the children,  whose costumes simply weren't good enough.  You still with me?  Can you go back to the part about the gay dinosaurs?  Like, how would they have known?  I made that part up.  Like, there's no such thing as a "fagosaurus."  And speaking of gay dinosaurs, let's talk Madonna.  Sure, now, she's got the face of Baby June  and the body of Iggy Pop,  but that ripped 60-year-old  was there for us, like nobody else.  Like, it's great  that you have no shame.  I mean, you missed the joy of signing up for football  to fool your parents.  But you guys can never forget the struggle that came before you,  the people that fought and loved and and died,  so that you could walk down the street in skinny jeans  with rights you never even knew you never had.  The minute we forget what we went through to get here  is the minute it could all be taken away.  And that will be the night  the lights go out in Georgia.  [CHEERING]  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  I'm a sperm!  [BREATHING HEAVILY]  I'm letting go. I'm going now.  You didn't save me!  Where the hell are you going to go?  I know you. You always think the worst is going to happen.  You're going to lose a client, then you don't.  You're going to miss a deadline, then you don't.  You think you can pull off a hat,  but you can't. [LAUGHS] Honey, you really can't.  I don't know if it's the shape of your head,  or that weird face.  Stop insulting me!  - Why? - It's making me mad.  - But you're not panicked. - No, because you're  Oh.  Yeah, mommy's got a few little tricks.  Remember that design showcase in 1999?  I was so nervous.  I was hyperventilating.  Mm-hmm, and then I sang you that song  that calmed you down.  Hush little baby don't say a word   Mama's going to buy you  [FLATLY] Drugs.  Honey, you remembered the whole thing.  - Feel better? - I do.  I am so sorry, Karen.  I couldn't do what I do without you.  And more importantly, I wouldn't want to do it without you.  Of course you have value to me,  and you deserve a raise.  Thanks, honey.  I guess your validation  was more important than I realized.  Well, you have it.  I love you, Karen Walker.  Right back at you, Grace Adler.  Shower off.  - Wait a second. - Hey!  "Grace Adler" is your safe word?  My name  is your sexual buzzkill?  It's better this way.    Well, we agree, we should probably both  date guys our own age, but, uh,  I think he's going to remember what I said.  You know, until the  ADHD  kicks in.  Mine left the apartment screaming  like Vera Farmiga in "The Conjuring."  I don't want to be a daddy.  I don't want you to age better than me.  Oh, come on, Jack.  Everybody knows Twinkies never expire.  Besides, you're a catch.  You will always be a catch, no matter how old you are.  How very, very, very old you are.  It's always a kiss and a punch with you.  Hey, Google, play Madonna.  I want someone that I have something in common with.  You know, a shared history.  Right?

                    			1 [SMOOTH JAZZ MUSIC]  Introducing the new spokesperson  for Wag and Bone Dog Food,  Mr. Jack Mc  - Line - You know my last name, Karen.  Honey, I did Ayahuasca with shaman last night.  I don't know if it's raining or Tuesday.  You really booked a commercial?  Technically, I probably booked it.  They unofficially told the gal who's basically my agent  that it's between me  and approximately three other guys,  so [BLOWS, CLICKS] it's in the bag.  Congrats, Jack.  Now, will you be playing the dog or the human?  See, guys, this is why I do it.  All the years of people saying, "You're too good for that job.  You should be leading a bigger life."  "Sir, this is a library. Put your pants back on."  Karen's taking me out to celebrate.  I thought you had a temp job today.  Oh, that's right. I forgot.  I picked up a day as a rehearsal pianist.  God, why did you make me a triple threat?  Honey, call in sick. Easy-peasy. Check it out.  Chris, I can't make it in today.  [COUGHING]  I sprained my ankle.  You know that Grace is still here?  Jesus, does that woman ever work?  Hasta la homos.  I don't wanna work today.  It's so expected.  You're my lawyer. Get me out of this.  [CLEARS THROAT] In the case of McFarland v. Reality,  the Supreme Court ruled, grow up.  - Adults go to work. - Why aren't you at work?  Oh, I scored a ticket to the Princess Diana gown exhibit  at the Met before it opens to the public.  I am freaking out.  - BOTH: Oh - You look shmancy.  If I was straight, I'd stare at you like a creep  and tell you to smile more.  I am going to the gynecologist.  What's with the faces? You both came out of vaginas.  I didn't.  I am a Platinum Star Gay.  Gay-splain, please?  A Gold Star Gay has never been with a woman.  Platinum haven't been with a woman,  and they were born via C-section.  Hence they've never touched a vagine.  It's all in his book, "Men Are From Mars;  Who Cares Where Women Came From?"  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   Where am I? What's going on?  You. I know you.  - You work here? - I'm Sheila, your nurse.  I used to work at the sperm bank,  where you tried to have a gay baby  or the donor was gay. I don't know, it was super gay.  What happened to me?  The doctor found some weird cells,  and so he did a biopsy on your left breast.  [GASPS]  Wait, left [GASPS]  Oh, that's the big one.  - So, are you telling me I have - Cancer.  I mean, you might have cancer.  There's a very, very, very slim chance that you have it.  You're supposed to lead with that.  I'm I'm taking this really well.  Why am I taking this really well?  Because you're coming out of a very heavy sedation.  We called your emergency contact.  - He's waiting outside. - Oh, good, I need Will.  Hey, Grace.  Leo?    [SMOOTH JAZZ MUSIC]  Hi, I'm Jack, the rehearsal pianist from Temporary Players.  - I'm looking for Alvin. - I'm Alvin.  Churro?  Uh, one, two, three, four, five  I'm sorry, I can't do it. Thank you though.  Um, so where does the magic happen?  Oh, we had to cancel the magic program,  'cause the money disappeared.  No, the theatrical magic,  where thespians work onstage, and "lespians" build the sets.  If you talking about the theater, it's right there.  I'm sorry, um, but in the words of  my dear friend Amanda Bynes,  where am I?  This is the Bronx Boys & Girls Club.  You're teaching an afterschool drama class.  - Starts at 3:00. - Alvin, was it?  - Alvin with an A? - Yep. Mm-hm.  Alvin as in, "Alvin!" [CHUCKLES]  Don't do that.  - Alvin - Mm-hm.  I used to teach, now I do.  In fact, I'm an almost working actor again.  You probably don't recognize me  from the regional dog food commercial I'm about to get,  but I certainly can't consider teaching kids  in an afterschool drama program,  but I think what you do here is great.  - You know, it's great, great. - Oh, yeah, it's best.  You know the Bronx silver service credo:  Come for the free internet, stay for the Obamacare  For now.  I don't get that. I'll see you later.  Pickles!  Pickles to heck!  I'm not familiar with that expression,  but I'm guessing you didn't get that commercial.  When you guess, you make an ass of you and me.  Well, you wanna teach, pickles?  'Cause it sounds like you're not gonna do.  How heavy was that sedation?  Because I feel like  my ex-husband is standing right there.  I think I'm still listed as your emergency contact.  How could that be? I told Karen to  oh, that's how.  I'm sensing some tension here.  - Who cheated? - He did.  Wow, seriously? That was just a shot in the dark.  It's a little bit more complicated than that.  Is it?    Acting is rejection, rejection, rejection.  Hope?  No, rejection.  So if any one of you can picture yourselves doing anything,  anything other than acting,  I'm gonna have to ask you to leave right now.  You, what do you wanna do?  I wanna be a fireman.  Oh, really?  Get out!  Not not out, out. You're a kid, that's crazy.  Just go to the bleachers.  If I seem intense,  it's for one reason and one reason only, 'kay?  I don't wanna be here, and I'm really sad.  That's two things.  Jordan, get out!  I can't bear to look at ya!  Not out, out. You're a kid, that's crazy.  Just go to the office. Just go to the office.  Look, if you have any hope of making it in this business,  you have to give me your undivided attention, okay?  Fully commit here and now.  You can't let anything distract you from  oh, my God, Karen's here. What are you doing here?  Well, I thought about going into work,  but Grace is at the lady doctor,  and if there's anything I don't wanna deal with,  it's Grace and her angry inch.  [GRUNTS] Honey, I'll just wait for you to finish,  and maybe we'll find a nasty roof party  and do a little beep-boop.  I didn't wanna say Molly in front of the kids.    Look, thank you for bringing me home.  Obviously, I'm going to change my emergency contact.  That's all right. It ain't nothing.  - I forgot you did that. - What?  When you wanna defuse tension, you  [SOUTHERN INFLECTION] Turn up the Cajun spices.  "Why, I'm just a handsome po' boy from N'Awlins.  I'm just eating my bowl of zydeco."  So, a po' boy is a sandwich,  and zydeco is a form of music,  and I am from Baton Rouge,  which is a completely different accent,  which I lost years ago.  I say, I say, yes, you did.  I'm not Foghorn Leghorn.  But I'm gonna give you a pass, 'cause I know that you're  - worried about your test results. - [ELEVATOR DINGS]  I'm not worried.  Everything's gonna be fine.  You know, it's okay if you tell me, Grace.  Seriously, I'm not worried about it.  I'm fine.  You can go now, Leo.  One of the good things about being single  is you learn how to get through a crisis alone.  - Hey. - I almost died today!  - [SOBBING] - What?  What are you talking about?  I had an emergency biopsy of my boob.  - The big one? - [SOBBING] Yeah!  I'm gonna get the results later today.  - Grace, that must've been so - Terrifying.  - Did it - They knocked me out.  - Because you're a big - A big baby.  Yeah, yeah. Come on, sit. 'Kay, sit down.  - How do you feel? - Not good!  I might have cancer.  - [GASPS] I smell toast. - Wh  I made toast.  Wait, you're eating bread?  It's not a cheat day. What's wrong?  No, I don't wanna make this about me.  You you're dealing with something real.  - Have you been crying? - No  I went to the Princess Diana exhibit,  which was amazing  But I bought remastered DVDS of the wedding and the funeral,  and I watched them back to back, and now I'm eating my feelings.  How could you do that to yourself?  She really was like a candle in the wind.  Speaking of just hanging out in the wind,  - I'm here. - Leo?  - How you doing, Will? - What are you doing he  oh, please, God, tell me you're not back together,  unless you are, in which case  [HIGH-PITCHED] Yay.  He's still my emergency contact.  What? I thought you told Karen to  oh, yeah, that makes sense.  You know, you should've probably been  her emergency contact, even when we were married.  Good luck with the test results, Grace.  Will, it was it was good seeing you.  What did he mean by that?  I think he just meant it was nice to see me,  and he understood that my feelings about  No, the thing before that.  What did you mean by Will being my, uh, emergency contact  - when we were married? - Grace, it doesn't matter.  No, just say it.  You never shared anything with me.  You always ran to Will.  Wasn't that the problem with our marriage?  You could never be in a relationship with me,  because you're always gonna have this weird thing with Will.  Oh, so that's it? I don't get a last word?  No, you get the last word  by bringing up who gets the last word.  Well, how about we're done talking  - and no one gets the last word? - [ELEVATOR DINGS]  - Fine. - You did it again!  You know what, I want the last word,  so you get on that elevator,  and you stand there silently,  until the door closes in your face.  - You know, this is - Ay oh oh ooh  Last word.  - Bye, Grace. - Dah    Why is your friend at the lady doctor?  Why does anyone go to any doctor?  Fear and pills.  But you mind your own business.  Do you know how I could find a doctor like that?  Ask your mother.  I live with my dad and brothers.  Oh, boo hoo, I didn't ask for your life story.  You're mean.  You have no idea.  Why do you need to go to the doctor anyway?  Mind your own business.  Hm  Brava.  But seriously, you can tell me.  I got a working relationship  with every doctor on Park Avenue.  Come on, what's going on? What's the deal?  Oh. Fine.  You're gonna be like that? All right.  If you're not gonna tell me what's wrong with you,  then we are done.  There is nothing left to say, period.  Ah-ho.    [SLOW PIANO MUSIC]    Okay, Jordan, listen  This isn't "The Miracle Worker," okay?  You need to make actual noises with your mouth.  - I don't think I can do it. - What you're having right now  is what we in the trade call performance anxiety,  and what my friend Will calls date night.  Nothing? No, nothing.  This guy gets it.  Mm, okay. Look, everybody gets scared,  but you can't stop trying.  When you're an actor, you gotta believe in yourself,  even when you don't.  Ben   The two of us need look   No more   We both found   What we were looking for   With a friend   To call my own   I'll never be alone   And you my friend will see   You've got a friend in me   [INHALES SLOWLY] I just got the chills.  I am an incredible teacher.  [SMOOTH JAZZ MUSIC]  Okay, I found the perfect activity to distract us  while we wait for the test results.  We are going to build a gingerbread house.  Don't know why. Just called to me.  What are what are you eating? What what are you eating?  Strawberry ice cream,  but I'm using chicken satay as the spoon.  [GROANS]  It must be bad news, Grace.  We're gonna get through this together.  I'll shave my head. Do you need me to shave my head?  No, no, the test was negative. I don't have cancer.  Oh, thank, God, I have a weird skull.  Hey, but this is great news!  Come on [LAUGHS] this is great.  Whoo!  Why am I whooing alone?  Is Leo right?  Did our relationship ruin my marriage?  Yeah, you got a little strawberry  Was I supposed to go to him instead of you?  - Just just stop, stop. - Are we weirdly close?  Stop, stop stop talking for a second.  There.  I believe you were asking if we are weirdly close.  - Yeah, are we? - Yes!  But here, you know what this is like?  Oh, is this gonna have  something to do with Princess Di?  I think we both know the answer to that.  Remember how we both hated Camilla Parker Bowles?  We were young. We rushed to judgment.  Exactly. Everyone thought she was the villain,  because she broke up this storybook romance.  - Well, do not forget the hats. - I wish I could.  But all she really did was was help Charles realize  the storybook wasn't true.  Wait, who's Princess Diana in this situation? Leo?  Sadly, yes.  And I'm Camilla.  Here, sit down.  The point is,  no happy marriage ends in divorce.  - Ah - I mean, I was there.  You tried everything you could.  Months of therapy.  Grace, you tried golf.  "Is the ball in the hole?" "No."  "How 'bout now?" "No."  "Is it lunchtime?" "No."  You only came to me  when you already knew it was over,  just like I came to you when things with Vince were over.  You're right.  So, you let Leo think what he wants.  - You're right. - What matters is  - you know the truth. - Exactly.  You don't have to explain anything to him.  Hell no.  You're gonna go explain things to him, aren't you?  Uh, Princess Jambalaya's not getting the last word.    All right, we good?  - Everything go okay? - Yeah.  You do everything I told you to do?  - Yeah. - Good stuff. Have a nice life.  [SIGHS]  [SIGHS]  Honey, you have somebody you can talk to  about these things, right?  Like a husband or a lover?  What? No.  [SIGHS]  Why does it always have to be me?  Honey  I know what just happened was a big deal.  It isn't fun, but this day never is.  For me, it was the summer of fift  sixt '79.  I was sitting on my front porch,  listening to my transist my Walkma  my iPod shuffle  And then it happened.  Well, I just wanted to run into my room and hide,  but my mom's idiot boyfriend  screamed to the whole neighborhood, "Hey!  Lois's kid just became a woman."  And then my mom celebrated  by opening her bottle of good scotch  and giving everybody in the neighborhood a drink,  everyone except the anxious 12-year-old  who needed it the most.  Look, Tasha, the point is,  I survived, and so will you.  You're not really mean, are you?  How dare you!  Get over here!  - Mind your own business. - [CHUCKLES]    [SMOOTH JAZZ MUSIC]  What are you doing here, Grace?  You and I did not get divorced  because Will and I are too co-dependent  or whatever.  Oh, crap.  I see you're still unaware of your wingspan.  Well, at least you're not blaming me and Will.  Well, technically, you came here to talk about Will, so  You know what, can I just please finish?  I'd let you, but you're putting his gall bladder  where his liver goes.  One drink, and he will explode.  Stop being charming.  You are wrong about our marriage.  It did not end because of Will and me.  - You're absolutely right. - I am?  I mean, I know I am, but I am?  Grace, it ended because of you.  Me? Me?  You were the one who joined Doctors Without Borders,  met a blonde, and it became Doctors Without Pants!  You see, you bring this up every time.  Well, it was a big deal!  Well, that was our first marriage, Grace.  The second time, I was in it, okay?  I tried.  But but you never let me back in.  I couldn't complain, because I was the cheater.  I I didn't have a leg to stand on.  You're right.  I am?  I-I mean, I-I know I am, but I am?  I tried so hard, Leo,  but I just couldn't forgive you.  - I know you tried. - I did.  I took up golf for you.  I took up golf for you.  I hate golf.  "Can I get back on the cart now?" "No."  "How 'bout now?" "No." "Are we the only Jews?" "Yes."  Now I'm sad.  We could've not played golf together.  [CHUCKLES] I guess we just got our signals crossed.  Yes, we did.  Okay  I guess, um,  I'm gonna go.  - 'Kay. - Oh, uh, one more thing,  I I don't have cancer.  I know. I ta I talked to Will.  Hey, Grace  you took my heart.  You took my heart too, Leo  But I believe  that we both are gonna find love again,  with the person we're supposed to be with.  No, I mean, you took my heart  From the model.  Yeah, you, uh  You put it in your purse.  I mean, I-I'm sure it was an accident,  but, you know, they they kill you on the replacement parts.  - You so set me up. - [CHUCKLES]  We always had that, didn't we?  We certainly did.  - And that ain't nothing. - Sure ain't.  See you around, Adler.  Bye, Leo.  Last word.       
                




                    			1 "Will & Grace" is shot before a live studio audience.  Honey, why are you making me go to work on a Saturday?  I should be home, making love to Stan  and watching cartoons.  Ah, I love cartoons!  You heard what we were talking about?  No.  Jack, why do you have to use my shower?  Four reasons: one, your water pressure's better.  Two, you've got that hand attachment  that gets to all those fun-to-reach areas.  And three through four, I've had two dates this week  with a bear who clogged my drain.  Since when are bears your thing?  I thought you were into twinks, twunks,  and everything else that Dr. Seuss didn't write about.  - All right, Karen, let's go. - [SIGHS]  Grace, you work too much, and you're not dating.  It's Saturday morning.  You should be slinking home  with your contacts in a shot glass,  scratches on your back, and itches on your front.  I went on a date last week.  Yeah, that was the meeting with the cabinet maker  you want to use, and he was blatantly gay.  When I came home, he was sitting on the couch  in the pajama party position.  I don't know that one.  Humbled.  Jack? Pajama party position. Please demonstrate.  Oh, yeah, sure.  No heterosexual man has ever sat this way.  If a sitting position could have a lisp,  it would be that one.  Let's go, Kar.  Honey, all I'm saying is that  if you don't start dating,  it's gonna turn into a fireplace you never use.  Open up the flue and put a big log in there.  Now that the men are off to work,  what should us girls get up to?  - Well, I read an article - No.  - But you can volunteer - Boo.  To clean historic houses.  You know how people say.  "Why is Will still single?"  I'm not one of those people.  [KNOCK AT DOOR]  Hi.  Oh, I'm sorry, dear, but I can't give you any money.  I don't support arts and music in schools.  I don't need the competition.  No, no.  I'm looking for Jack McFarland.  I'm Jack McFarland.  You have a son named Elliot, right?  Technically, although,  like my friend Will and his hair,  we had a falling-out years ago.  Why do you ask?  I found some of the letters you wrote him,  and since I'm in New York with my parents, I wanted to meet you.  I'm sorry. Who exactly are you?  Oh, I'm Elliot's son, Skip.  One more time, dear. I'm a trifle "deef"  in my upstage ear.  I'm your grandson!  Can I call you grandpa?  Oh, my God, you have to.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]     Hey, got ahold of Skip's parents at the hotel.  They're on their way, grandpa.  Oh, please!  I just found out my youth-obsessed best friend  has a grandson. I am obligated to torture you.  It's in the contract.  I didn't even know he existed.  How could Elliot not tell me this?  You haven't spoken to him in years.  Because he moved to Texas,  married someone super conservative,  and he didn't even invite me to his wedding.  And you got your feelings hurt  and cut him out of your life.  I didn't cut anything!  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!  Edward Sissy-hands.  This is your chance to patch things up.  Elliot and his wife are coming over.  Your grandson is in there. Go talk to him.  How am I supposed to connect with a kid from Texas?  I can't fish or hunt  or tell a woman what to do with her fetus.  So, Skip. [CHUCKLES]  Are you having fun in New York?  Yeah! I love it!  Would you excuse us just for a second?  Don't get too excited.  We can't know for sure.  Really? The pajama party position?  Is that not enough evidence to convict  misdemeanor over there?  Take it easy. We are not doing an episode  of "Law & Order: LGBTQ."  Don't mind me, boys. I forgot my Birkin.  Close your mouth, kid. You're gonna catch a fly.  Jesse Tyler Ferguson, she is fabulous!  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  Okay, Google,  turn down the lights.  Okay, Google, turn on the lights.  Great. Mom's home.  Tony, I don't know what's going on here,  but Karen always takes things too far,  and she is grinding up against me  right now, isn't she?  She was, but it's more like a dry hump thing  with a little bit of spankings.  Stop.  Isn't there something that you would like to say to Tony?  Yes.  I'm so sorry  that I didn't think of this earlier.  Heads up, Puerto Rico! Have a good time.  Karen!  It's okay, Grace.  Every time she does it,  I make her send a grand to hurricane relief.  Worth every peso.  Karen, I don't know where to start.  You have got to stop  sexually harassing the employees.  It's bad enough that you do it to me.  Well, honey, if you didn't want me to play with him,  why'd you buy him for me?  Wait a minute.  You bought him for yourself.  Well, good for you, honey.  That is exactly what you need.  I am his boss. I would never even think that.  Oh, right. Because your snooch died.  My snooch  is not dead.  Then why isn't it breathing?  [MELLOW JAZZ PIANO MUSIC]    For Halloween last year,  I went as my favorite singer, Lady Gaga.  Do you guys know who she is?  Know who she is? Ha!  Excuse me. I sewed my own meat dress.  Okay?  I went as Lady Gaga last Halloween.  And the one before that and the one before that and  and sometimes not Halloween.  So, Skip, you didn't mention why you and your parents  are here in New York.  I'm going to a camp. Upstate somewhere.  [GASPS] The best theater camps are upstate.  French Woods? Stagedoor?  Let me go to my apartment and get some props  for you to take with you. Oh, my God,  this is so much fun. I can't believe  - [DOOR THUDS CLOSED] - How old is my grandpa?  He is in his early 100s.  - [KNOCK AT DOOR] - Yeah.  And if you tell him he looks 85,  he'll be so flattered.  - Elliot. - Hey, Will.  Dude, not cool.  Oh, you cannot just run off like that.  Wow, look at you. You're a you're a real Texan now.  I am. I drank the Kool-Aid  and can no longer separate church and state.  That's my wife, Emma.  - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.  It's a really cute place you have here.  Oh. [CHUCKLES] It's very artsy.  Emma's never been here before.  You don't say.  Well, you may find it a little strange at first,  - but we're all ex - Now [CLEARS THROAT]  A good wig  is all about versatility.  Okay?  This one could be Sia  or Cruella de Vil,  or an indecisive Anna Wintour.  What happened? Did you leave?  Elliot.  Jack.  BOTH: Nice costume.  [PIANO MUSIC]  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  Mom, guess what.  Jack was Lady Gaga for Halloween too.  Oh! Fun.  All right, well, we need to go.  We don't want to be late for the first day of camp.  Yeah, it was really nice meeting all y'all.  Could I say good-bye to Jack and Will?  Quick, all right? We'll be down in the lobby.  Jack.  Elliot.  I wish I could stay.  I know. Me too.  Maybe we should, uh, get Skip to the elevator.  Okay, yeah. Hey, what's the name of that camp,  so I can write you?  Camp Straighten Arrow.  [ELEVATOR DINGS]  "Straighten Arrow"?  Is that a new theater camp? I never heard of it.  No, it's a  camp my parents found to fix me.  Fix you?  So I can be normal.  Bye.  [UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC]    Hey, I'm sorry about  - what happened this morning. - No. No, no, no.  Do not apologize.  I feel terrible and embarrassed  and hungry but that's not about you.  [SIGHS] I talked to Karen.  Look, it's not all on her, you know?  We were just fooling around, and I was singing  her favorite song.

Wow.  But maybe try singing it from your diaphragm, though.  - Do you mind if I show you? - Oh.

As a sperm donor,  the law doesn't recognize you as a relative,  just as someone who made a little money  doing what he would normally do for free.  Are you suggesting that we make a life-size dummy  using pillows and overalls and leave it in Skip's place  while we take him away?  Oh, my God, it's as if  you can read the minds of other idiots.  No, we can't kidnap him. We need a plan.  Okay, okay, okay. Um, how about, um  Well, go ahead. Say what you were gonna say.  - I wasn't gonna say anything. - No, no, go ahead.  I'll say mine afterwards.  - I'll get Skip. - Skip  - I'll send him out here. - Him out here  - You tell him this is a bad place. - A bad place.  And if he wants to leave, then we'll do  - everything we can to help. - Help him. Yeah.  Yeah, that's right. That's what I was gonna say.  - Ah. - Keep going.  - I'll find a way to divert the staff. - Divert the staff.  And you talk to him.  Talk to him. Yeah.  Yeah, I was gonna say  "distract the staff," but I don't know,  I guess yours could work.  Great, and we'll talk about having a good time  and not acting on our impure impulses.  It's not your fault [SPEAKING CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]  - Jack? - [PEN CLATTERS]  What are you doing here?  What are you doing here, bringing Skip  to a place like this?  What happened to you, Elliot?  What happened to us?  You know what happened.  You never approved of me being with someone like Emma.  I'm sorry if we have certain beliefs that you don't.  Because they're terrible beliefs.  Oh, well, that's really open-minded.  It's who we are, Jack. You can't  judge someone for who they are.  Are you honestly saying that here?  I have never been 100% clear what irony is,  but I'm pretty sure that's it.  Ugh. We just  don't want him to  Turn out like me?  We're his mom and dad.  Go home, Jack.  Okay, campers!  I'm Reggie, and this here  is my beautiful wife of ten weeks,  Roberta.  No. No flirting, fellas, okay?  - She's taken. - [BOTH LAUGH]  Ah, you. [LAUGHS]  Okay. Well, it is time now  for what we at Camp Straighten Arrow  call reorientation orientation.  - Wordplay! - Reg.  Okay. So  Did you see, guys, what I did just there?  That and this  that's what we don't want.  - Because that didn't feel good. - Mm-mm.  - It didn't feel natural. - Natural. Nope.  Skip, don't turn around and don't say anything.  Are you here to be fixed too?  Your grandpa wants to see you outside.  Now, the important thing  is that we're all gonna have fun.  Yeah. Because  BOTH:  We pray, we pray   We pray the gay away   'Cause boys like girls and girls like boys   And that's what God done say   Hey  Okay.  [UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC]  Honey, don't be so hard on yourself.  It was bound to happen.  - Was it? - Yes, Grace.  Crazy things happen  when you ignore you hoo-ha.  It did feel good.  You know, I think I have been denying  a vital part of me.  I mean, I am a very sexual woman.  Sure, I don't like to move around  when I'm doing it, and  once I got caught eating  a sleeve of Ritz crackers during  But I am a woman in her sexual prime.  Attagirl. [CHUCKLES]  I am going to put myself back out there.  My marriage died,  but the rest of me didn't.  Did you hear that, Sophia?  I talk to mine too.  What's that, Jan?  I know. Sophia's a domina shh.    Back in the old days,  they used a shock collar  to curb any unnatural tendencies.  Remember those days, Reg?  Ugh, I sure do.  They were effective, but really unpleasant.  And besides, look at this thing.  It's like, "Hello!"  Aren't chokers over already?"  Excuse me. I have a question.  Uh, I'm sorry, sir, but, um, but  but parents aren't allowed in the lodge  for another 20 minutes. [CHUCKLES]  Oh, I I'm not a parent.  I'm the director of the new conversion camp  across the lake, Camp Kick-a-Mo.  We don't have a lake.  Roberta, let the beautiful man speak.  We at Kick-a-Mo thought it might be fun to have  a friendly competition with the other  conversion therapy camp in the area.  Well, I think I would have heard if there were  It's a competition, Roberta!  [LAUGHS FORCIBLY]  There's no way  you're a better conversion camp.  - Oh, really? - Yeah.  Our success rate is tops in the country.  Plus, all of our counselors  are now certified straight people.  You don't seem that certified,  what, with your dewy skin and your puffed-up basket.  Oh, I'm certified, all right.  In fact, I could kiss  any male counselor in this camp  and not feel a thing.  - Well, that is the most ridi - Challenge accepted!  Well, uh, round one was a tie, kids,  but round two is where I'm really gonna  - [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] - Oh, God!    The point is, this place can't fix you  because you're not broken.  I'm confused.  Of course you're confused. [SIGHS]  So, let me tell you a story about another young man  who was once confused.  A young man who grew up to be a model citizen  and today is proud  of who and what he is.  People adore this man,  not only because of his good looks  and dynamic personality,  but because of his open, loving heart.  - Will? - No, not Will!  Will's a fat lawyer!  Why does that guy make an impression on everyone?  [SIGHS]  I'm talking about me.  It was hard for me once, too,  but believe me, it gets better.  I don't see how.  Ugh. Skip  You are gonna be invited  to so many good dinner parties.  And there's something else.  When you get older, you'll understand  that there's the family you were born into  and the family that you choose,  and the family I chose  well, it doesn't get any better than that.  But what do I do now?  I don't know.  Your hero, Will, didn't really think this through.  You're just gonna have to be really strong.  It's hard, being me sometimes.  I know, but I'm gonna be there for you  as much as I can,  and when I'm not,  I want you to picture me in your head,  looking at you like I am right now,  and saying, "You"  are exactly who you're supposed to be."  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]    Made you some hot chocolate.  With those little marshmallows floating on top?  We were out of marshmallows.  Ugh. This day couldn't get any worse.  [KNOCK AT DOOR]  Hey. Could I speak to Jack?  I don't think that's a great idea.  It's okay, Will.  [CLEARS THROAT]  [SIGHS]  I spoke to Skip and he told me what you said.  Then I looked around and I saw the camp  for the first time through his eyes.  Made me sick.  I had to get him out of there.  - Thank God. - [SIGHS]  And then [EXHALES SHARPLY]  In the car, on the way back to the city,  Emma and I got into a pretty big fight, and she said,  "Do you really want Skip to end up like Jack?"  And I said, "You mean someone who'd"  "drop everything to  "help someone he cares for live their truth?  Yeah, I do."  Anyway, um  Emma let Skip leave the camp.  So  I guess that's a first step.  Jack, I know we haven't been  close over the last few years, but  you really do mean a lot to me.  You're my dad.  That means so much.  But in public, you're my brother.  So, uh, Skip and I are gonna  hang around the city for the next few days.  I was wondering if you wanna take your grandson  to his first Broadway show.  Please look away.  I don't think a boy should ever see his father cry.  I mean brother.

Oh, hey, hey.  - What about that short little - What did we say  about miniskirts after 40?  No more knees.  If I get this, I know exactly  what the rest of my life would be like, you know?  No more worries. No surprises.  Yep, that's why your letters to Santa always had a P.S.  "Don't get creative. Stay on list."  What's gay, beautiful, and just got rich  for doing nothing?  Jared Kushner?  It's me.  I gave Theodore at work a dollar to buy a scratcher,  and he just texted me we won two grand.  I'm a thousandaire.  Wait, who's Theodore? I thought you worked  for a guy named Alvin.  Theodore's Alvin's brother. They both work  at the Rec Center.  Do Theodore and Alvin have another brother named Simon?  [LAUGHS]  You're much older than me,  so I don't get your Chipmunks reference.  - Better? - I don't love the scarf.  It's a little too, "Put your tray tables  in the locked and upright position."  - I knew it. - Give the scarf to me.  You see? Now the fan makes sense.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   Thanks, Caddy. Put my clubs over there.  Oh, and tell Masseur that I just played the front nine  and need a back rub.  Actually, tell him I played the back nine  and need a front rub.  Say, a morphine drip.  Why, that's a nice touch.  No card? Huh.  Hello, this is Mrs. Walker in 705.  Who do I have to thank  for this lovely morphine drip in my room?  What? I'm not recovering  from plastic surgery.  I've never had anything done in my life  in the United States.  What do you mean, someone else booked the room?  I pay a lot of money to belong to this country club,  and I booked this hospitality suite months ago.  I'd like to see who has balls big enough to ask me to move.  Well, well, well.  I must have died during surgery,  'cause the devil herself is before me.  Why, Beverley Leslie.  I thought they'd torn down  all the corroded old Confederate statues.  You remember my business associate, Benji.  What happened to the other Benji?  Ooh, something terrible happened to him.  He got old.  Give us the room, Benji. Go work on your hammies  for our meeting later.  Now that the pleasantries are over with,  get out of my room, Dixie Dinklage.  I'm not going anywhere.  I've just had extensive plastic surgery.  Where? Oh, wait.  Let me guess. Labia reconstruction?  - Now get out of my room. - I'm not going anywhere.  Please, just let me rest for a little while.  We'll discuss this later. Now, help me into the bed.  Oh, all right.  I've seen Gardener do this with sacks of peat moss.  [GRUNTS]  Now hook up my morphine drip.  - Oh, I'm in terrible pain. - You think you're in pain.  This martini is dry as a bone.  [PIANO MUSIC]  And since we would custom make everything in the rooms,  your hotel guests could go online and buy all of it.  Now, Eli, I know that we're a small business.  It's just me, my assistant, and an apprentice designer.  But I promise you that we can rise to the occasion.  Should I sleep with Andy Cohen?  You're gonna have to go with your gut on that one.  Well, I get what you're all about.  You've got a great eye.  I guess it's just, like,  "Do I wanna write a Cinderella story?"  I think you do. [LAUGHS]  You could be my fairy godmother.  [LAUGHS]  I didn't mean "fairy" like "gay."  Unless you loved it, and in that case,  it's like, "Hey!"  I'm getting on a helicopter at eight.  It's between you and one other designer.  Think about something you can bring to the table  that's gonna close this deal.  Um, you know what? I think I have something  that you might like.  Tony?  You need me, Grace?  Okay, I like where your head's at.  What's your kink?  - I'm straight. - I'm listening.  - I I don't know. - I mean, I guess I also like  cuddling with my girlfriend afterwards.  I don't really know her, so I'm gonna pass.  Um, darn it?  - I'm sorry, Tony. - Um, can you grab the layouts  that we were working on?  - Sure thing. - Thank you.  I wasn't quite ready to show you these yet,  - but I - [ALERT CHIMES]  - Who's that? - My roommate.  And I will call him back.  Is he into guys?  Big time homo.  You wanna go to the ball, Cinderella?  Stick that in a pumpkin and send it my way.  [PIANO MUSIC]  Okay.  So, the scratcher's in your hand.  Then what happens? Don't leave anything out.  - Okay, you ready for this? - Yeah, yeah.  I need three matching numbers.  I have two with one box  - left to scratch, okay? - Oh, my God, Theodore!  Okay, so, keep going. Yeah.  All right, so I found a pencil  with a missing eraser, right? And I think to myself,  "Will this metal band work  as a scratching device?"  Only one way to find out.  I try it. It works.  Third matching number. $2,000.  Oh, my gosh!  That story had conflict. It had drama.  It's what Shonda calls "conflama."  And don't you think I forgot who bought me the ticket.  I got something coming to you, too.  Theodore.  There you go. Love you, man.  Thanks for the dollar.  Yo, check out this mini espresso maker I just bought.  It's coming in a little later today.  Pop a mini pod in, makes a perfect cup of coffee.  Where's the other $999?  - What you mean? - I paid for that ticket.  So half the money is mine.  I already bought a very expensive item.  What?  Not a jean jacket with my best friend Karen's face  emblazoned on the back, if that's what you're implying.  Jack, that money isn't yours.  - You said, "We won $2,000." - I said, "I won $2,000."  - You said, "We"! - I said, "I."  - Check the text. - I will!  What matters here is the principle, Theodore.  I financed your investment.  You should give me half that money.  But I'm not going to.  So we got conflict and we got drama.  [GASPS]  How dare you throw conflama in my face?  [PIANO MUSIC]    [PHONE RINGS]  Hello?  No, you got the wrong number. This is not Jhanvi.  No, it's not Nirmalan, either.  Yes, ma'am. If I see either one,  I'll tell them to call home.  - Well, anything? - No.  The review went great.  I'm still waiting for them to call.  [PHONE RINGS]  Hello?  No, I am not Jhanvi.  Wait, is this Nirmalan?  You're supposed to call your mom.  Happy to help.  How'd your meeting go?  - Great. - It's between me  and one other designer.  That's amazing. What can you do  to seal the deal?  Well, I feel like I've done all I can do.  You know what I was thinking about today for some reason?  How cool is it that gay guys  don't make a big deal about sex?  That's a huge generalization.  Yeah, but you know what I mean.  It's like, you could hook up with a guy you barely know  and it would be fine.  Maybe in my 20s.  Yeah, but who doesn't miss their 20s?  Being a young single guy having meaningless sex  with a young single guy.  Potentially helping a friend in the process.  Grace.  Are you trying to pimp me out to your client?  No, of course not. Unless you're up for it.  Grace!  I'm sorry. Okay, okay.  Just forget what I said. I'm a terrible person.  It's just that you called in the middle of my presentation,  and Eli said that you had a cute gay face,  and I said you were a big time homo, and  Eli, as in Eli Wolf? Your hotel guy is Eli Wolf?  Yeah, you've heard of him?  Of course I've heard of Eli Wolf.  He's a total power gay.  He's hot. He's rich.  He's exactly who a potential senior partner should be with.  And you're a potential senior partner.  I know. I love him for me.  [PIANO MUSIC]    Aww, nuts.  There's nothing in the mini-bar.  Or, as you call it, bar.  Has that morphine kicked in yet?  Karen, I've always considered you a dear friend.  That's a yes.  I feel a burning need to share something  intensely personal with you.  But it's just so hard to say out loud.  Oh, for God's sake. Don't cry.  You look like Jeff Sessions watching a black man vote.  Karen, this may come as a great shock to you.  But I'm a homosexual.  That's it?  What's your next bombshell?  Harvey Weinstein isn't always a perfect gentleman?  That's it. I'm gay.  Does the hustler posing as your business associate know?  He suspects.  Karen, I need you to help me come out to my wife, Crystal.  Tonight would be a good night to tell her,  but it's her 90th birthday, and I'm afraid the shock  might kill her.  Come to think of it, tonight might be  the perfect night to tell her.  All right. Fine.  But if I help you, I get my room back.  Deal.  Wait a minute. Crystal's already dead.  I went to her funeral.  You and original Benji had the first dance.  The first shovel of dirt on the coffin revived her.  And I learned a valuable lesson.  Appreciate every day of your life.  And when it comes to your loved ones,  cremate.  Always cremate.  [PIANO MUSIC]  But that's not right. I didn't sign for it.  No, I don't have the espresso maker in my possession.  So whoever told you  Oh, hey, partner.  Where is she?  Where's my tiny coffee maker, Jack?  Oh, she's in a safe place.  But you'll never find her without me.  - Is it the girl's bathroom? - No.  - Get out the way or I'll - Or you'll what?  You can't hit a gay man. It's a hate crime.  Besides, the second you walk out,  I'll find where you're keeping that money you owe me.  Yeah, good luck with that.  Is it in the cigar box inside the shoebox  - inside your desk drawer? - No.  - [THUD] - Ah, ow, oh.  - Ha! - Ha ha!  - Ha ha ha! - Ha ha ha ha!  Gimme half that money or else!  Or else hitting a black man is a hate crime, too.  Rarely enforced, but still.  - Well, I'm not racist. - And I'm not homophobic.  Then it looks like we've arrived  at a real Mexican stand-off.  Wait, is that bad?  Should it be Hispanic stand-off?  Or is saying "stand-off" like I think they're all standoffish?  I think you need to be more earth tone, neutral.  And I think it's Latino-American now.  Oh, right. Totally.  Then it looks like we're arrived at a real  Latino-American misunderstanding.  [PIANO MUSIC]  Will, congratulations.  I made senior partner.  I know exactly what the rest of my life  is gonna look like.  And I feel I don't know what I feel.  Is this really what I want?  Charles has so much suppressed rage,  he's gnawed off all his nail beds.  I think Eileen's dead.  Goldblet. God, he's always hated me.  Welcome, Will. You're one of us now.  ALL: One of us. One of us.  One of us. One of us.  One of us. One of us.  - One of us. - Run.  ALL: One of us. One of  I hate my job.  My whole life, I've been working towards  something that I don't even want.  I thought I wanted to be partner, but I don't.  I thought I wanted to have sex with you, but I don't.  Oh, no, no, no. No, I can rally.  Look, no more tears. [LAUGHS]  - Let's have some fun. - Okay.  It's just that I, uh, I hate my job.  I just got a text from Eli that the date was a bust.  What happened?  I was upset. I wasn't exactly in the mood.  Well, couldn't you at least have given him  a little something-something?  I would have done it for you.  You absolutely would not have.  Well, it's different for a woman.  Thank you. I just lost  the biggest gig of my career.  - Something you wanna ask me? - What else is there?  Of course. I'm such an idiot.  Did he say what hotel he was staying in?  That's the question you have for me?  I remember. He said he was  taking a helicopter.  Maybe I can still fix this.  [PHONE RINGS]  Hello?  Hey, Jhanvi.  Yes, I have been crying.  [PIANO MUSIC]  You know what hurts more than the money?  Although, make no mistake, the money hurt a great deal.  I thought you were a good person.  Well, that's entirely on you.  'Cause I've given you absolutely no reason  to think well of me.  Mr. McFarland, can you walk me to the subway?  My dad's car died.  But he's a Lyft driver. How's he gonna do his job?  He's not. The repairs cost, like, $1,800.  Isn't that about $2,000 minus a tiny coffee machine?  - That must be - a white person question.  Tasha, wait.  Just tell your dad you found a scratcher  and you won enough money to get his car fixed, okay?  - What do you mean? - He means,  "I'm gonna give you the money."  What are you  What What  Oh, my God. You're an amazing person.  Wait, that's not even his.  It's not about whose money it is, Theodore.  It's about Tasha and the nice thing I just did for her.  Thank you so much. I'll wait out front.  Okay.  Great.  I knew you were a good person, Theodore.  At least your coffee machine's paid for.  I may have made a very expensive credit card purchase  that I can't pay off now.  Can't you just return it?  Not really.  [PIANO MUSIC]  Beverley, I'm back. Beverley!  Sorry, Crystal and I were helping each other  use the toilet. Don't try to get up  on your own, birthday girl!  It's like her arms are made out of balsa wood.  I thought long and hard about how to help you  come out to Crystal.  What on Earth are you talking about?  The secret you told me when you were guzzling morphine  - like a little hamster. - What exactly did I tell you?  That you like Ding Dongs more than Ho Ho's.  That you gobble more hot dogs  than a Japanese competitive eater.  That you've been ridden by more bears than a bike  in a Russian circus.  Pip-posterous. Me, a homosexual?  The very idea makes me howl with manly laughter.  [HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH]  - Get out of my room. - This is my room,  and I would never give it up to you.  We had a deal, you finger puppet.  - The deal is off. - All right.  Well, I guess you win this round, Beverley.  But before I go, let me just send  my birthday wishes to your beautiful bride.  [PHONE BEEPS]  What did you say in that message?  Just a suggestion as to how  she could celebrate this birthday with her husband.  [KNOCKING]  Oh, sweet Jesus.  That means she wants to make love.  [KNOCKING]  From the front.  Chin up, Beverley. Think of it like golf.  Just keep hacking away at the sand trap,  and hope you get it close to the hole.  Eli, wait.  I've already made my decision, Grace. you would.  [KNOCKS]  Well, you should have picked me.  I have vision. [GRUNTS]  And instinct.  And if you're going to ignore all of that  because I didn't get you laid, well, then I don't wanna  work with you anyway.  I did choose you, Grace. You got the job.  This is big, Grace.  I need to be your only client.  I'm all yours. This is my dream job.  Too bad Will doesn't feel the same way about his job, huh?  What do you mean?  Did he hear something?  I didn't ask him. [SIGHS]  I get it, universe. I'm garbage.  [PIANO MUSIC]    Oh, look. It's white Diana Ross.  I didn't ask you why you were upset.  You didn't make senior partner?  - No, I did. - Congratulations!  - And I'm miserable. - Why?  Because I don't wanna be a corporate lawyer  for the rest of my life.  I was wrong, Grace.  I want surprises.  Will, you want surprises?  How about this? Come work with me.  What?  Eli hired me to do his hotels.  It is working on a scale that I never even dreamed of.  I mean, I'm thrilled, but I'm terrified.  It's too big for me. I I can't do it alone.  - What exactly are you - Quit your job.  Let's run my business together.  Grace, what you're saying goes against every fiber  of my being. I'd be taking  the biggest risk of my life.  - So you're in? - 100 percent.  Yeah!  Oh, my God! I'm so excited!  - Me and you. - You and me.  - We're the perfect team. - Perfect team.  - Will and Grace. - Uh  It sounds weird.  Grace and Will. Now that sounds like a thing.      
                




                    			1 Sorry I'm late, but I got here as soon as I wanted to.  Karen, now that I'm working here,  I think we need to have a little chat  about getting here on time.  [LAUGHTER]  You know, I spent half the morning  trying to track down Rosario.  I don't know where she went.  She never takes a day off unless it's Christmas  or "maids eat free" day at Applebee's.  Can't you just phone the vet and have them track her chip?  Not if she's outside the perimeter.  - I was kidding. - Maybe she's tired.  When was the last time she had a vacation?  She just took a vacation. She went to the wine country.  You made her pick grapes.  Oops.  [PHONE RINGING]  Here she is.  Okay, Rosie, you've got some nerve, not showing up for work.  You better be in the hospital.  Uh-huh.  Mm-hmm.  That's a good excuse.  She's in the hospital.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   It was a heart attack.  Looks like she'll pull through it.  Jack's in with her now.  Ugh, what a relief.  You wanna know what's a little weird?  My chest is feeling tight.  I'm feeling pain in my right arm.  If you were having a heart attack,  you'd feel pain in your left arm.  Ow!  [GASPS]  Maybe don't make this about you.  You really want those to be the last words  you ever say to me?  - What - [PHONE CHIMES]  - Oh, cool, we got the place. - What are you talking about?  I took over the lease of the office next to you.  - We just doubled our space. - You signed a lease?  Yeah, hey, want to go down to the cafeteria  and sneak frozen yogurt out in pill cups?  That's a little surprising to me.  That is? I've seen you eat an entire rotisserie chicken  standing in the check-out line.  No, that you signed a lease without talking to me.  Why? We agreed we needed more space,  and I had to move fast.  He'll figure it out.  Oh, it's after 10:00. It's after 10:00.  [PANTING] It's after 10:00.  Can someone please give Rosario her jello?  All she had to do was hold out until 10:00 for her jello!  Please give Rosario her jello!  [PANTING] Oh, thank you.  She said I could have her jello.  Why do I feel like you're not happy about this?  Because I'm not. You really should have asked me  before signing anything.  Asked you? I'm the business half.  Will, we're in the hospital for Rosario.  We are not doing this now.  You really should have asked.  Look what I got for Rosie.  "It's a girl"?  They were out of "It's a maid."  It's the thoughtlessness that counts.  I do hope the poor dear is okay.  Who asked you, Riverdance?  Put these in water.  She's just a little worried.  There's nothing to worry about.  Interesting fact:  Rosario and I were once husband and wife.  I loved her as much as a gay man  forced to marry a woman to get a green card could.  You know what? I've already decided,  when we get out of here,  I'm gonna throw her a quinceaÃ±era.  You know, she never had one.  Don't they do that at 15?  Or are you counting in maid years?  I think in her culture, they wait until after menopause,  to mark the moment a woman becomes a man.  Mrs. Walker, can I speak to you for a moment?  No, I'm good.  I'm afraid I have some bad news.  Oh, no.  There were some unexpected complications,  and I'm very sorry to tell you that Rosario is gone.  Gone? Where'd she go this time?  Underground maids' fight club that I don't know about?  Karen, I don't think you understand  I understand, Grace.  Wow, look at this.  It's a really lovely chapel.  Maybe you could lease it and not tell me about it.  Okay, we need to talk.  This is Rosario's funeral. It's so petty to bring it up.  - But you're wrong and I'm not. - Hey  How are you doing? Do you need anything?  Why does everyone keep asking me that?  I have been on my own since I was nine months old.  I breastfed myself.  I need nothing.  It's just something people say.  - [SIGHS] - I think it's great  you still threw Rosie a quinceaÃ±era.  Well, her mother was a monster.  She never gave her one. [SCOFFS]  Can you imagine anyone being that mean?  Jack, what the hell are you doing?  I said I wanted the photo of Rosie from the Christmas party.  Sorry, I thought this one screamed Ro-ho-ho!  What? No.  That's Rosie at the Easter egg hunt.  That's Rosie at Burning Man!  That's better.  She loved that picture.  It makes a world of difference, doesn't it?  She has been beating the crap out of me  for two straight days.  I don't know how to be around her.  I'm more confused than Britney on stage in Vegas.  So is this Karen sad?  Well, I guess it makes sense.  You know, grieving comes in stages.  She was in anger and now she's probably moving on  Jack, where the hell are those books of magic spells?  Crap, I forgot to put out the Bibles.  Hello, Mother.  Lorraine Finster.  You have got to be out of your mind,  showing your faces here.  Well, I heard as soon as I came.  Oh, I remember you two. Hello, Bill, hello, Patty.  I wouldn't dream of not being here.  I mean, you married my father. I slept with your husband.  That makes us family.  So sorry for our loss.  What do you want, Lorraine?  You're not getting anywhere near Stanley,  you're not stealing the jewelry off of Rosario,  and we are not having a threeway again.  Do you know how humiliating it was for me  to have to finish myself off in front of your father?  So turn around and Brexit!  Mothers and daughters, eh?  Always that lingering tension.  Listen, love, I know no one could ever replace Maria.  - Rosario. - Yeah, that's what I said.  Oh, come on, how about a little hug for old time's sake?  Sure, honey.  [SIGHS]  Well, I'll leave you to it.  [SIGHS] Yeah, I knew she took 'em.  But at the end of the day, aren't we all whores,  just looking for a dirty pole to take our last ride on?  And, look, Rosie, I'm wearing the pin you gave me.  I know Karen told you that  I thought it looked like a blood clot  But honestly, the only reason why I haven't worn it  is because I misplace it  Oh, my God, I'm lying to a corpse.  You're making a pentagram.  Why don't you do it right and not tell me about it?  Okay, look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have signed  the lease without talking to you.  You want me to get us out of it?  No, it's good, but thank you  for understanding how I'm feeling.  We're partners. You know, from now on,  I'll run everything by you, you run everything by me.  Well, I don't know if I need to run everything by you.  What does that mean?  I mean, if we're being honest,  you do work for me.  I work for you? I work with you.  We can't talk about this here.  With, for, what's the difference?  - But it's for. - It's with!  And we're absolutely not talking about this here.  - And it's with. - For.  - With. - For!  My mint just flew into the coffin.  - That's horrible. - No, it's okay.  I have a couple of loose ones in my purse.  [SIGHS] Father Closet Case wants to start.  I cannot sit next to Karen, okay?  It has to go Will, Grace, Karen  No, wait, no, that's not that's not right.  It has to go it has to go Grace, Karen, Jack, Will  No, wait, um  No, no, it has to go Will, Gra  Oh, my God, there's no mathematical way  not to sit next to her!  Jack, Jack, I know it's hard,  but we only have one job,  and it's to make sure that Karen gets through this day.  The only thing that matters is Karen.  Okay, you're right. It's all about Karen.  - Just one problem. - What's that?  Karen isn't here.  According to Find a Friend, she's at the bar next door.  Nice detective work.  You put the Nancy in Nancy Drew.  I'll go talk to her.  I know what she's going through.  Don't make it about you.  - I don't do that. - Yes, you do.  I don't even know where you get that from.  You sat shiva for Jerry Lewis.  He was very important to my family, Will.  We named our dog Lady just so we could go "Lady!"  [SIGHS] Ahh, Smitty.  Am I ever going to smile again?  Mrs. Walker, my hearing isn't what it used to be.  I was robbed at gunpoint, and a bullet,  it grazed my brain and I'm almost entirely deaf.  [LAUGHS]  Oh, Smitty!  You always know just what to say.  Just so you know, the service started.  Karen, I get what you're going through.  When my mother died, I was a wreck.  On the day of her funeral, my sister had to dress me.  I couldn't even do my own blowout.  And I really wanted pretty hair for my mom, you know?  But I made it.  And everyone said how brave I was.  And how pretty I looked.  And everyone said how proud they were of me.  And I was proud of me, too.  But it doesn't change how much it hurts.  I was her favorite.  Oh, my God, she must miss me so much.  [SOBBING]  Your sisters must really hate you.  I was the light of her life!  And sometimes,  after a night of gentle heterosexual lovemaking  Where I was on top  [LAUGHS]  Rosie and I would do other normal couple things.  You know, like get into a fight at Ikea,  or shoot and skin a deer.  Or argue about how much time I'd spend in my man cave  Which I always thought meant something else.  Recently we had begun to talk about starting a family.  [CLEARS THROAT]  And now, I think it's time to hear from  a very special woman in Rosie's life,  someone who was much more than just her boss. Ladies  [WHISPERING] She's not here.  Stretch.  Karen's not coming.  - You made it about yourself? - My mom just died, Will!  - Jack, you're up. - No, no, I can't, I can't.  I can't be around her when she's grieving.  - It scares me. - You just told a church  full of Catholics that you and Rosie  remained pure until you presented your flower  to each other on your wedding night.  - You can do anything. - Okay, okay.  I'll try, I'll try.  There's another way to do this.  Lizzie, Ricky  We steal her car, we buy an 8-ball,  we head to Atlantic City, and whatever happens, happens.  I think it's what the dead maid would have wanted.  Oh, my God, we're wearing the same pin.  You have good taste.  - Hey, Kare - Don't touch me.  Yes, sir, sorry.  Um  [WHISPERING] We were wondering  - The whispering is irritating. - Sure, yeah, sorry.  [RAISING VOICE] I really think  Well, you don't have to scream at me I'm in mourning.  I-I just want to help.  Really? You want to help?  I do. More than anything, Kare.  Then sing something for me.  Oh, I don't know that this is the place  You sing!  Because I'm happy   Clap along if you feel   Like a room without a roof   Because I'm happy clap along if you feel like   Now add some moves. Do The Electric Slide.  That's what you want to do   Because I'm happy clap along   Do "Ease on Down the Road."  - What? - "Ease on Down the Road!"  Because I'm happy   Clap along if you feel like   That's what you want to do   Do "Thriller."  Because I'm happy   Clap along if you feel like   That's what you want to do   Because I'm happy clap along   If you feel like that's what you want to do   Because I'm happy clap along if you feel like   Queridos, amigos.  So, if I work for you,  do I have to run every contract by you?  It is so inappropriate for us to  We are way past inappropriate.  You do not ask a priest to top you up  on the blood of Christ.  What took him so long?  And why is there only one server?  He's not a server. He's the priest!  Anyway, I'm used to my business being only me.  Yeah, I get it. It's yours.  You might have mentioned that before I quit my job  and changed my entire life for you.  How'd it go?  I've never been so humiliated  without specifically asking for it.  Can I get a beer?  [SIGHS] So now it's your turn?  Take your best shot, Mary.  I got nothing to say.  You know what you're doing.  Damn straight.  You're handling this exactly the way  you want to handle it.  Like I always do.  I don't need to parade myself up there  and boo-hoo over my cleaning lady.  And I don't need to be told I should be there,  I'm gonna regret it.  And I certainly don't need people coming up in here  What?  But you  Of all the times  to come onto me.  You pervert.  [SIGHS]  I'm so sorry.  Funeral's over. Everybody's gone.  If you want to see her one more time,  she's still there.  And it's okay if you can't.  [SIGHS]  What do you think, Smitty?  I'm sorry, um what?  [LAUGHS]  You never turn it off, do ya, Smitts?  [SOLEMN PIANO MUSIC]    Hi, honey.  You got candy in your hair.  Sorry I wasn't here, but  come on, what the hell was I gonna say?  She was my maid?  She was my sparring partner?  She was my best friend?  You were my everything,  Rosario Yolanda Salazar.  You know, it's funny. People keep asking,  "What do you need? What do you need?"  I need for you to not be gone.  Here, honey. I want you to have something.  It was my mother's.  Makes sense you should have it.  Lord knows you've been eyeing it for years.  Honey, I'm not going with you to the cemetery,  so don't get mad, okay?  I just can't watch 'em put you in the ground.  I have to remember you my way.  So if it's all right  I'm just gonna sit here with you for a while.  [SIGHS]  Te amo, Mommy.    That's Karen sad.        
                




                    			1 "Will & Grace" is recorded  in front of a live studio audience.  - Excuse me, do you think - 45 "min-oohs."  - Minutes? - "Yus."  - It's gonna be a while. - [SIGHS]  What are we doing?  Christmas used to be so magical and fun,  and and now we're just getting attitude  from "No Table for Old Men."  - Let's go home. - No. Will, no.  If we don't maintain our Christmas Eve tradition,  then we'll be forced to spend more time with our family,  and that's just not what Christmas is about.  Sorry we're late.  Jackie and I were doing our gift exchange.  I got a faux fur!  Great coat. Uh, two two things:  A, uh, it's 65 degrees out,  and B, you don't look foolish at all as the white Shaft.  - Can you dig it? [CHUCKLES] - Mm-hmm.  It'll get colder.  It's gonna snow tonight.  Karen promised me a Christmas miracle,  and rich people don't lie.  I think we have very different interpretations  of the word "snow."  Ah  A quick "oop-date," your table will be ready  in 51 "min-oohs."  That's more "min-oohs" than before.  That's "race-oost."  Okay. I'm not doing it.  Ugh, no, Will, it is Christmas.  I am done with Christmas.  And who feels like celebrating, anyway?  All the crap going on nowadays.  I don't understand you, Will.  This is the one time a year  fat people are supposed to be jolly.  It's not going to snow,  there's no such thing as miracles,  Christmas is for spoiled rich kids,  and and and Santa's just another old white perv  we once trusted.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   Oh! Thank God you're open.  Hi. Can I use your bathroom?  Hi, I'm Pete.  Welcome to the Immigrant Historical Society.  Can I interest you in a tour?  She just needs to tinkle, Hodor!  Uh, the bathroom's for customers only.  Okay, I'll buy this book, so that she can pee.  Not the first time I've said that sentence.  Okay, so he's buying a book, we're customers,  so your bathroom is  Only for customers that take the tour.  I really should've clarified.  Oh, come on!  Fine, we'll take the tour.  The night's ruined anyway. Couldn't get much worse.  That's the spirit.  - It's up there. - [FRANTIC EXHALE]  I'm just gonna say it.  I love museums!  Jackie, this is the Immigrant Historical Society.  It's just gonna be poor people's bodies  mounted and stuffed with newspaper.  Look at these pictures of old New York.  Can you imagine how great Christmas was back then?  You know, horse-drawn carriage rides  and carols sung by candlelight.  You'd walk down the street and say, "Merry Christmas, sir,"  and he'd say, "Same to you.  I like the shape of your mustache."  And I'd say, "I like yours too."  [CHUCKLES]  Wow, you didn't even have gay game 100 years ago.  I feel so much better.  I am never gonna complain about anything ever again.  Ready to take that tour?  Ugh, really? We're still gonna do this?  We're about to enter  the fully preserved tenement of an Irish immigrant,  the widow, Karolyn O'Sullivan.  Welcome to Christmas 1912.  - Where is she? - I think she's still asleep.  - I'm so hungry. - [SIGHS] Where's Ma?  It's Christmas morning, and she's not out of bed yet.  I think she was drinking again last night.  [GROANS]  I had the nicest dream.  I was rich, and none of you were here.  Merry Christmas, Mother.  All right, me children,  it's time for your Christmas presents.  Gather close.  If we were any closer,  we'd be our own aunts and uncles.  No one likes a funny girl, Mary!  Now, do you want your Christmas onion or not?  Then hold baby.  Why doesn't baby have a name, Ma?  You know she'll get a name if she survives the winter.  Don't want to get too attached.  All right, children, onions for all of ya.  Pour me a drink, Smitty.  One of you run downstairs and give an onion  to old man Flannery.  Old man Flannery's gone.  He was beaten to death with a pipe by an anti-Irish mob.  They found his rotted body in the East River.  [LAUGHING]  Ah, Smitty  [EXHALES]  Ya always know just what to say  to cheer your mother up.  [KNOCKING ON DOOR]  [GASPS] Oh, me stars.  If that's the landlord come for the rent, we're done for.  Under the staircase you go.  Oh, if he sees ya,  he'll he'll take you to work in his sweatshop.  [KNOCKING ON DOOR]  Top of the Christmas mornin' to ya.  William Howard Taft, you are fabulous.  Why, thank you, kind sir, but who are ya,  and why are ya knocking on me door?  The name's John Patrick, and I'm a sailor  looking for a bed to rent between boats.  Oh  You want to rent from me?  - It's a Christmas miracle! - I don't have any money  Never mind.  But one thing I can offer is that no matter how bleak  and depressing life may be,  I'm always happy and gay.  You do seem surprisingly gay.  I can't help it.  Everything about this city makes me gay,  especially all the beautiful girls I have intercourse with.  It's settled, then. You're staying.  - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Open the door.  It's your landlord, Mr. Van Billioms.  As in Billam Van Billioms?  He's one of the richest men in New York.  And one of the cruelest.  His heart is black as coal,  and no one knows why.  - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Oh. I've spilled on your coat.  Take it off, and I'll wash it for ya.  Mrs. O'Sullivan  You are late with the rent.  You forced me to leave my wife on Christmas  to travel to this filthy godforsaken neighborhood  full of lazy scum,  and that has put me in a very bad mood,  a mood that has soured my day,  a mood that has oh, hello.  I didn't see you there. Hi. [CHUCKLES]  What, are you are are you Mr. O'Sullivan?  No, sir. He's me new boarder.  John Patrick McGee.  Ay, where are me manners? Let me put my coat back on.  No, no, no, no, no, leave leave it off.  No need for modesty.  It's not the first time I've seen a man's naked arms.  I've I've seen that the usual amount of times.  [CHUCKLES]  Seven.  And it is it is hot as Hades in here.  I'm I I almost feel like taking off my own coat,  not that I would.  I never would. [NERVOUS CHUCKLING]  It's a preposterous suggestion!  I won't have you make it!  You will have my money by sundown,  or I'll see you out in the streets.  [SNIFFS INTENSELY, GRUNTS]    Fanny!  Fanny?  Fanny! Where is my confounded wife?  I'm right here.  Why ya hocking me?  Oh, my God, where you been?  I've been looking all over for you.  I was downstairs, ringing the Christmas goose.  Don't you think you should do that in private?  It's a smart joke.  You didn't get it. Other people would get it.  No one likes a funny girl, Fanny.  What the devil are you eating?  Oh. It's these new cookies they invented.  They're two chocolate biscuits  with cream on the inside.  They're called "Oh-ray-ohs."  Billam, oh, my God,  "Oh-ray-ohs" are so good. Here, here, you gotta try one.  Absolutely not.  I just fit into this weskit.  It would take 20 minutes on the mechanical horse  to work off even one "Oh-ray-oh."  Fanny, why do we have a harp now?  You don't even play.  It's nice. It's very heaven-y.  I mean, come on, look around.  Have I ever been wrong about decorating?  In fact, I had an epiphany this morning.  What if I started a new business,  where I decorate the interiors of other people's homes?  I would call myself  an inside-of-homes decorator.  My wife, starting a business  - Mm-hmm. - Never.  People would say, "Billam used to be the man of the house.  Now his Fanny runs it."  You've got to get such foolish ideas out of your head, Fanny.  A woman's place is to support her man,  - keep his home - Share his bed?  Not necessarily. Every relationship's different.  Well, I don't have time for this.  I've got a family to evict.  Oh, Billam, no, you can't. It's Christmas  and Hanukkah.  Fanny, you converted.  Please stop mentioning Hanukkah.  [GUTTURAL] Hanukkah.  Hanukkah.  Like [GUTTURAL] "Happy holidays."  Enough!  My tenant broke her contract.  Though I can't help feeling for her strapping boarder,  no bed to call his own,  out in the cold,  holding himself for warmth  With those toned and  tattooed arms.  Stop polishing your stick. You've already rung your goose.  Right. I'm off.  Whoa!    [COINS CLINKING]  Well, angels,  even after selling Smitty's wooden leg  We're still $10 short of making rent.  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Oh!  Someone's coming up the stairs.  Quick, quick, go hide.  Hurry, they're coming!  Who loves women, survived scurvy,  and has big news?  'Tis I!  I've discovered something incredible down at the docks.  - He found money. We're saved! - Now, it's not money.  Never mind.  Without money, I'll have to give my body  to that awful landlord, Billam.  Trust me, he wouldn't enjoy it.  And why not?  I may have delivered nine children,  but most of the heads were tiny.  No, Karolyn, he wouldn't enjoy it with any women.  That's what I discovered.  He's a sweeper of chimneys  A snake charmer.  He only travels by tunnel.  What are you saying to me?  He's a mustache bumper.  He rubs the silverware without a cloth.  He plays the flute of the damned.  He's a homo.    [FESTIVE PIANO FLOURISH]  Billam, wait.  I cannot let you put these poor people  out on the street on Christmas.  It's not fair.  The gentleman I acquired this property from  says the poor have only themselves to blame,  and I have yet to disagree with anything out of the mouth  of Mr. Frederick Trump. [INHALES SHARPLY]  Extra! Extra!  Oh, newsboy, I'll take a paper.  Well, well, well  Billam Van Billioms.  Hello, Charlie. Never mind.  Oh, you know this very old paperboy?  Only as the occasional buyer of his newspapers.  So you're all alone on Christmas?  Sadly, yes.  It'll just be me and my newspaper sales associate,  Benji.  Ta-ta.  Maybe I should hire a newspaper sales associate.  But you're in the real estate business.  They're related. It's hard to explain.  This is why women shouldn't work.    Oh, what am I to do, John Patrick?  I've got no money,  and my body's useless to Billam.  - But mine isn't. - [GASPS]  I saw the way he was looking at me.  His eyes were removing my outer clothes and my underthings  And doing swirlies all around me front bits.  He did all of that with his eyes?  And more.  He licked one finger and tended my rear garden  With his eyes.  But to lay with another man?  Oh, it don't mean the same thing for a sailor.  When you spend your life at sea without women,  you learn to drop your line  over the other side of the railing.  - So you've - I've had sex with men, yes!  But only on boats!  And it didn't make me feel gay,  just a wee bit queer.  Hmm.  [KNOCKING ON DOOR]  [GASPS] It's him.  [RHYTHMIC TAPPING]  I've come for the rent, Mrs. O'Sullivan.  Oh, I love this place.  It's shabby, but it could be very chic.  I'd call it chic-y shab.  This is my wife. She came along for some reason.  You brought your wife? He brought his wife.  How is this going to work with her standing  I'm working on it!  Nice to see you again. Mr. McGee, is it?  First name, John, I want to say.  Middle name, Patrick, or something.  I'm not good with names.  [BOTH LAUGH]  [BABY WHIMPERS]  Is that a baby in there?  Billam, have mercy on this woman.  Her children are living in the closet.  What's wrong with living in the closet?  Closets can be nice, I  not that I know a whole lot about closets.  Why are we still talking about them?  Enough of closets!  Mrs. O'Sullivan, I'll have my money  or see you evicted.  Before you evict me,  I'll see me honor defended.  What? How have I insulted your honor?  Why, you've stomped your foot  on an Irish woman's floor.  That's one of the worst things you can do in this culture,  isn't it, John Patrick?  I'd be less offended if you dropped your drawers  and did your dirty business on me boot.  You'll have to settle it out in the hall, like men.  Oh, this is ridiculous.  I am absolutely not gonna  out in the hall it is.  Let's settle it out in the hall.  - It's nice you have children. - [CHUCKLES]  We tried.  Well, I tried, but, you know,  men and their headaches  Maybe it's what you're wearing.  1888 called. They'd like their drapes back.  You're funny. I like that in a woman.  Oh, you know, Alice Roosevelt  telegraphed something funny to me the other day,  and then I re-telegraphed it to a whole bunch of my friends.  I ate a rat last night for dinner.  Look, I know it's tough being an immigrant.  Irish, Italian, Jews.  No picnic being women, either  Hmm.  But this country is built on  letting more people enjoy its great freedoms,  not keeping people down.  It may take longer than it should,  but we always get it right,  eventually.  Hmm.  Sorry, dear, the opium just kicked in.  I heard none of that.  [MUFFLED THUMPING]  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God, oh, my God!  What do you think's going on? It sounds like they're praying.  Ay, I'll bet someone's on his knees.  Ladies, I've changed my mind.  It's Christmas. I can't just throw you out into the street.  There'll be no rent collected today.  Saints preserve me. We're saved!  Oh, Billam,  - you've done a good thing. - Hmm.  The Christmas spirit really got inside you.  Hmm.  Right  it was the Christmas spirit.  Since we'll be able to survive the winter now  because of ya, I'd like to name my baby daughter after you.  That's the kindest thing I've ever heard.  - What's your name, by the way? - Fanny.  Uh-huh, and what's your middle name?  Wow. What a story.  It's so specific.  I didn't know poverty could be so sad.  At least it all worked out, Kar.  Oh, no, that was just Christmas.  Karolyn eventually served four years in debtors' prison.  John Patrick died at sea.  Billam was convicted of sodomy and died penniless and alone.  Fanny was the first woman to vote in New York,  and the first woman killed for voting in New York.  You might want to end the tour before that part.  Could you imagine being gay back then?  Ugh, or a woman?  Or a hot sailor?  Or an immigrant?  I thought working harder for less  was their American dream.  [MOUTHS WORDS]  Well, you know what, I'm done complaining  that things used to be better. They weren't.  I mean, they're not great now,  but we do have a lot to be thankful for.  And we should have faith that it will get better.  The arc of history is long,  but it always bends towards justice.  I'm guessing you dated a guy named Justice?  And we called my penis the Arc of History.  Yeah.  Oh, God, who used this antique toilet?  It's not connected to anything!  Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!  Grace, how could you not know?  I knew.  When I went to pull on that chain and nothing happened,  I saw my whole life flash before my eyes.  Oh, my gosh, you guys, it's snowing!  You did it, Kar!  Ah, you bet I did, Jackie,  all for you.  [BELL DINGING]  Hey, it's midnight.  It's Christmas!  - Ah, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, you guys.  - Aw, Merry Christmas. - You see?  This is what the holidays are all about.  Have yourself   A merry little Christmas   Let your heart be light   Oh, I just remembered,  we have to be somewhere before she finishes.  From now on   The troubles will be out of sight   - [DOG WHINES] - So, so sorry.  She'll be done soon.  -  Have yourself  - Hi.  - I like your mustache. -  A merry little Christmas   I'm Will.  Make the Yuletide   Gay   Next year all our troubles   Will be miles away   All right, let me try it again.  That accent, it's a bitch.  [LAUGHS]  Rat.

Jackson Boudreaux.  - No way! - From Extreme Bread?  We watch that show all the time!  I make his bread all the time!  I eat his bread all the time!  He's so much more than bread. He's worldly, and spiritual.  All I know is the episode  where he rolled naked in bread crumbs sent me to heaven.  There he is. Be cool, be cool.  I am Jackson Boudreaux, and this  Is The Art of Bread.  Bread-making. Love-making. What's the difference?  Nothing.  We need both, and we knead both.  So manly.  So let's make love, everyone, by which I mean bread.  And then we'll make love again, by which I mean more bread.  Now who's horny?  For bread.  Not bad, huh?  Are you making an ashtray?  No, it is a bread bowl, and you know who will know that?  Jackson Boudreaux.  - Mmm, I love your ashtray. - Thank you very much.  You've been rough with her.

Oh, wait, oh, I guess I am.  Delightful.  I would like to spend time with you.  - Me? - I love that as a question.  Just one thing though, I hate the term "celebrity,"  but I'm a very big one.  When things end up in the tabloids  Oh, I hate gossip more than anyone!  I heard it ruined Ben Affleck's marriage.  You are damaged in the most beautiful way, aren't you?  I am.  We will be in touch. Now you go bake that bad girl!  She's not bad.

You are so you, aren't you?  You know, I've always thought so,  but it is so nice to hear someone else say it.  I got to say, big fan.  You know, it was so cool, when that one baker  refused to bake the cake for the gay wedding.  - The way you - Shhh.  Don't let words get in the way  of what we want to say to each other.  - Um. - That's right.  - Uh. - Oh, yeah.  I would like to spend time with you.  I feel the same.  You won't tell anyone, okay?  I don't know anyone.  You slept with Jackson Boudreaux?  I did.  Well, squirt me into a doughnut,  because I am officially jelly.  But I'm surprised, you usually go for more effeminate men.  Like Grace.  Don't tell anybody, all right? Especially Grace.  Not a word.  I'm kind of excited, you know?  I feel like I'm being rewarded  for stepping outside of my comfort zone.  Trucks for Tykes, Trucks for Tykes   - What are you doing? - Oh, sorry, go on.  You know, we're taking this bread-making class,  and there was just Will you stop it?  I can't!  That song's been stuck in my head for days!  Well, sing something different.  You don't think I didn't think of that?  That thing swats away other songs  like Lindsey Lohan swats away second chances.  Did you hear they cancelled "Riverdale"?  What?!  No!

He texted me first, I win.  Oh, and guess who just got invited to a party at his loft?  [PHONE RINGS]  Me, hah!  At 2:00 AM.  Wow, that is way past your bedtime.  I'm up at 2:00 AM all the time.  To pee.  Oh, no, we're the first ones here.  There's a note.  "Make yourselves comfortable amongst the pillows."  What, they're sitting on the floor?  Worried about your back, Will?  No. Worried about your knees, Grace?  No.  - I'm so comfortable. - So am I.  I could sit on the floor of a party no one attends every day.  Hello, lover.  BOTH: Hi, Jackson.  I am so glad you're here. You look gorgeous.  BOTH: Thank you.  Let us break bread together.  Ah, ah, ah.  Mmmm, oh. This is delicious.  Mmmm, what is it?  Hopi bread with snake venom.  - Snake what? - Oh, don't worry.  In the right quantity, it's an exquisite flavoring.  What if it's in the wrong quantity?  Oh, it could be fatal. Let me get us some wine.  Find your own place!  - How's the bread? - BOTH: So good, love it!  To us.  To us.  And to us.  So when is everyone else showing up?  What do you mean?  Well, you said it was a party.  And so it is. Let's party.  It's just us?  The three of us are on this journey together,  and the next natural stop  is to experience each other simultaneously.  You mean one at a time?  That's not what simultaneously means.  I, I don't know, I  I think Grace would have a real problem with that.  No, actually, Will would have a problem with that.  - I got no problem. - Neither do I.  Fantastic.  Then I'll be in the bedroom waiting.  Lighting an obscene number of candles.  Because like candles, we are meant to burn all night.  Oy.  Hot.  Grace, come on, you're not going to do this.  Just leave and let me have Jackson.  I am going to do this,  so maybe you're the one who should leave.  I'm not going anywhere.  Well, then, I guess you and I  are walking into that bedroom together.  I guess we are. I'mma walk.  So am I.  Heading right for that bedroom.  Yup.  Just making a b-line.  You, me, Jackson. That is three naked people.  And two of them are us.  Just about there.  One more  step.  [CLEARS THROAT]  - Well, last chance to bail. - Too cool to bail.  Because it's about to get real.  I am all about real.  All right, why don't you two get started?  - Way too real. - That was too real. Too real!  So give a darn and give a truck!   Hey, can I get ahead of you in line?  I need to see the doc real bad.  - Meth? - I'd love to.  But I am flipping out!  Well, it's going to be a while.  Apparently this emergency room has a pecking order.  It goes "life threatening illnesses"  and then everyone else.  Honey, they're not taking us seriously  because they never heard of whatever it is we got.  You're right! It's all about marketing.  I mean, no one ever heard of the ACLU  until that ice bucket challenge.  I'll get you checked in, Mr. Boudreaux.  Richard, we need to issue a correction to the new cookbook.  It turns out the Hopis were wrong.  There is no such thing as a safe amount of venom  from the North American sidewinder.  Also, I feel like the cranberries are overkill.  That's Jackson Boudreaux!  I'm not supposed to tell you this,  but Will's been sleeping with him.  Honey, I knew there was something  I wasn't supposed to tell you.  Grace is sleeping with Jackson Boudreaux.  And her doorman.  Wait a minute, are you telling me  that Will and Grace are Eskimo sisters?  Honey, I have no idea what that means,  but that is exactly what I am saying.  - Whoo! - Honey.  Wait a minute.  Do you not hear what I don't hear?  I think I don't. Kar, the song's gone!  - It is! - Maybe the idea of  Will and Grace being one penis away  from actually having sex with each other cured it.  You're right. And good for Grace.  You know she's one step closer to her ultimate goal.  Yes, it is I.  I would like to spend time with you.  So not my type.

Go on.  [PIANO MUSIC]    Oh, Grace, I've had the craziest day.  Not crazier than mine.  Larry told me that he's in love with Will.  That's insane. Larry could do so much better.  So are you gonna tell Will?  No, no, I can't. It'll ruin our friendships.  But I figured out a way to keep them apart.  - See what I've dec - Boo.  I don't need to know your process, okay?  My turn.  So I hit Val with Karen's car,  and Karen's in her apartment right now.  And I'm a little afraid for her.  Am I overreacting?  - Wait, wait Val, crazy Val? - Yeah.  If anything, you are under-reacting.  I don't know what kinda crazy scam she has [GASPS]  I know what it is.  There are people who throw themselves  in front of expensive cars trying to get money  out of rich people.  I heard the same thing on Fox News,  so you know it's a true fact.  [SIGHS]  [PHONE DINGS]  It's Karen.  "Val braided my hair and we're walking to Central Park."  Okay. Okay, okay, okay.  You know what you need to do.  - Yes. - Okay.  But you say it.  Okay, you need to sneak into her apartment.  [MUMBLING ALONG] apartment, right.  - Go through her computer. - computer, yeah.  I was gonna say "tablet," but go ahead.  And find evidence of whatever scam she's pulling.  [MUMBLING ALONG] pulling, yes.  I was gonna say "proof," but "evidence" could work fine.  I know this is extreme,  but we are not dealing with a normal person.  She is not like us. She is a total wack-a-doo.  All right, here is a key to her apartment.  [ELEVATOR DINGS]  I secretly made a copy 15 years ago,  and I keep it on me at all times, in case Will  ever goes missing and I need to search for his body.  Remember: wack-a-doo.  [ELEVATOR DINGS]  Hey.  You are going to be so proud of me.  A situation arose at work, and I was tough.  - Fantastic. - Yep.  I fired Larry.  What? Why?  Wait, you fired him because he kept agreeing with me?  I did it because you were right he has no experience.  No, no, no, you were right. He's a good hire.  - No, you were right. - You were right.  Typical man why can't you just admit when you're right?  [PHONE RINGS]  [CHRISTOPHER CROSS' "SAILING" PLAYING]  - Hello. - Hey, Larry, it's Will.  Grace told me everything.  - Everything? - Yes.  We can make this work.  - Really? - Yeah, now, just  can you meet me at the office?  Sure, just give me 20 minutes to shower and trim.  Okay, um, hey, hey and just, you know,  until we figure the ins and outs of this,  let's better not tell Grace.  Or Joe.  Okay.  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]    Oh, my God.  - Hello, Jack. - Val.  What the F. Murray Abraham are you doing in my apartment?  I could ask you the same thing.  It's my apartment, Jack.  Ooh, I walked right into that trap.  What happened to your limp?  - What happened to your limp? - I never had one.  Ugh! I walked right into that trap.  What is this, Val?  Why do you have pictures of me and Karen?  And why is your face on my body?  Oh, that?  [STAMMERS] That was here when I move in.  Whatever scam you're running, it is over when I tell Karen.  You're not telling anyone. Gah!  [SCREAMING]  [PIANO AND BONGO MUSIC]  Larry?  Oh, hi.  I kinda need the office.  Grace you know, Grace?  I'm not the deaf one.  [STAMMERS]  I'm so, so so  why why am I still doing that? I can't  - Hey, Will. - Hey, Larry.  Um, full disclosure.  When Grace first hired you, I admit I wasn't sure.  But now that you're here, I can honestly say,  I really want you.  - Wow. - [LAUGHS]  I'm all yours. I just wanna make you happy.  And you do, you do. The problem is Grace.  You know, she won't admit it, but I think she's jealous.  I thought she was over all that.  You know, I think it comes down to the fact  that I can be hard, you know? She can't.  But, that's just nature.  [SCOFFS] Tell me about it.  You know, Larry, if we're gonna make this work,  you can't just get behind me,  you gotta get behind Grace, too.  Oh, Will, that's asking a lot of me.  I know, I know.  I don't like it either.  But I do it.  You know, just to keep the peace.  Joe said you did, but I've never believed him.  Hey, you know what? Here's a good idea.  Let's, uh let's role play.  You, uh you, you take one position.  And I'll take another position. Then we'll switch, okay?  - You ready? - Oh, dear.  This is a lot more activity than I'm used to.  Do you have an energy bar?  Sure. I I  I usually dip this time of day too.  Let me see what I got, uh.  Grace keeps a secret stash of snacks in different places.  She's like a squirrel that way.  Ah, here we go.  This one says it's healthy,  but it's probably no better than an Almond Joy-oy-oy.  Will? Joe told me that Larry was  oh, boy-oy-oy.  Grace, come to bed,  so I can get my part of this over with first.  [PIANO MUSIC]  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  What the  Karen, there is so much I need to tell you.  Pause I love the braids play.  Val's been scamming us! Look at this.  She knew I was a Lyft driver.  She knew where the car would be.  And I'm pretty sure she jumped in front of it.  Is this true, Val?  No.  Val.  Karen.  Val.  Karen.  Okay, I did it.  But I didn't do it for your money,  I did it for your friendship.  For my friendship?  Not for my money?  Okay, what kind of sick game are you playing?  It's just so hard to make friends  after college, you know?  Oh, sure, but why me?  I mean, of all the people you could  Oh, now, I get it.  I am the whole Van Damme package.  You are, and you're just so good to Jack.  I just wanted a friendship like that.  That's all.  Shouldn't there be an easier way?  I mean, couldn't we just make a lunch date?  You'd really go to lunch with me?  Of course.  I mean, you're nuttier than a tree full of squirrels, but  We do have the same blood type and that can come in handy.  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]    Uh, what is going on here?  I didn't tell you the real reason why I  - I fired him. - Huh?  Uh, it's because he's in love with you.  Ah, okay. Um  A. You might've mentioned that part.  How would you have handled it?  Well, I certainly wouldn't have been so mean.  He's a friend of ours.  Oh, now look who's the softy.  Oh, you were the softy.  You hired him in the first place.  Maybe I can be both hard and soft,  did you ever think about that?  I'm so soft right now, I may never get hard again.  Guys, I'm sorry.  I think that I was having a mid-life crisis.  I'm gonna get dressed and go home to Joe,  who I love.  He's kind.  And he has a man's ass.  No offense, Will.  What?  I don't think I should work here anymore.  Can we pretend this never happened?  - Oh, yes, oh, yes. - Of course, of course.  You should come by on Friday.  We digitized all of Hannah's school plays.  Oh, that sounds so fun.  - What is wrong with you? - I don't know, it's a disease.  [PIANO MUSIC]    Okay, driver, take me to Costco.  I need to buy paper towels. [LAUGHS]  Are those even words?  Karen, that was so nice,  us saying we're gonna hang out with Val.  We're not going to, right?  - Oh, honey. - [ENGINE TURNS OVER]  We are never gonna see her again.  - [THUDDING] - [TIRES SCREECH]  Hey, guys.  My Wednesdays just opened up.  [PIANO MUSIC]      
                




                    			1 "Will & Grace" is recorded in front of a live audience.  I'm just gonna say it.  I had a terrific morning at church.  I learned a lot.  Did you know that back in the day,  gay best friends were called apostles?  And, Grace, you'll be interested to know  Mary Magdalene is a derivative of the Latin word  "hag-dalene."  You're gonna hate Leviticus.  Hey, hey, hey, don't touch.  I'm having Vince over for breakfast.  Eyebrow raised.  It doesn't mean anything. We're just friends.  It always amazes me  how gay guys stay friends with all of their exes.  I'm not friends with any of mine.  Grace, romance is different for us.  A date between straight people sometimes leads to sex.  And sex between gay people  sometimes leads to a date.  Well put.  I'm not finished.  You do that a lot.  And sometimes a date leads to a serious relationship.  And sometimes said relationship leads to dumping Will.  In summation, Vince dumped Will,  and that is the gospel according to Jack.  "Gay-men."  He didn't dump me, okay? We just reached an impasse.  I wanted to move in, get married.  But Vince has commitment issues, so  - So he dumped you, and - He wasn't finished.  You do that a lot.  [KNOCK AT DOOR]  Oh, my God, he's here.  You've never looked worse.  I wish I had my hot rollers and another hour!  At least pinch your cheeks for color!  All right, all right.  We're just friends. It doesn't matter what I look  Why is my head on Betsy DeVos' neck?  Hey!  Aw, crap, you're all here.  I only brought one of my famous homemade soaps.  - Oh. - I'm just kidding.  What am I, a monster?  Look, made from real shea butter.  - Mm. - I call it Shea Stadium.  It smells amazin'!  You know, 'cause the Mets?  Wrong crowd.  Uh, speaking of crowds  Ah, yes. Come, Sister Hag-dalene.  Coming, Old Testicle.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   So Aunt Rita tells my mom  that's her lasagna pan, and my mom says,  "It's not yours, Rita.  I think I know what my lasagna pan looks like."  Right, 'cause Rita's is the one  with the cartoon lemons and vines on the side and  and musical notes for some reason.  What? That makes perfect sense.  Ivy, ivy, lemon, lemon, ivy, lemon, food   I guess sometimes things are so obvious, you can't see them.  So the reason I came over today,  - I have big news. - Yeah, first,  just a little just do that.  - Here? - Nope, this side.  - Hmm? - You can't feel that?  God, that would drive me crazy.  What is that, butter or olive oil?  I don't know. I put both on my bread.  Both? Wow, that's  that's not a piece of bread.  That's a cry for help.  How about you don't let it bother you so much  and let me tell you my story?  Oh. Go ahead.  Just ew, sorry. There.  - You done? - Mm-hmm.  - Can I tell you my news? - You made detective.  - I did? - I don't know. Did you?  No, why, did you hear something?  - How would I hear something? - I don't know.  You just said I made detective.  I thought maybe you knew something.  How would I know something? What am I, a detective?  That's low, Will. You always gotta go bitchy.  I didn't  What's your news?  I'm getting married.  Oh.  Ryan and I just decided it's time, you know?  Yeah, yeah, no, nine months is, uh  He's not pregnant, is he?  I'm kidding. Look at you, jumping in.  - Ah, good for you, Vince. - Obviously, you're invited,  but you know you don't have to come.  Well, of course I'm coming.  I'm just saying, if it's gonna make you  feel weird or anything, don't feel obligated.  Don't be silly.  I'm thrilled that I'm coming to your wedding.  I want you to be happy.  All right, good.  So happy.  Can you pass the butter and the, uh, olive oil?  [BRIGHT MUSIC]  [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]  Oh, hey, honey, I like what you're wearing.  Thanks, Kare.  This is just my daytime romp-him.  It's like a romper, but it's more masculine.  Say, Karen, have I missed my window  to ask why you got a monkey on your shoulder?  It's for my scavenger hunt.  A live monkey is worth 100 points.  A live Kardashian is only worth 80.  I'm so glad there's gonna be so many cops at Vince's wedding,  because there's an NYPD badge on the list.  I'm glad it's a gay wedding,  because I have anonymous daytime sex on my list.  I was just about to ask Will what to wear,  but is it bad luck to see the jilted lover  on the day of his ex's wedding?  Let's go to your apartment, put all your clothes  out on the bed, and whatever the monkey  doesn't throw his poop at, that's what you'll wear.  Ow.  Oh, crap.  Just made it curly.  You know, I've been up all night.  I've had six cups of coffee, a 5-hour ENERGY,  four Coke Zeros, and a partridge in a pear tree.  Sweetie, you seem a little manic.  Are you sure you want to go to this wedding?  'Cause Vince said you didn't have to.  What are you talking about? I've gotta go.  Happy to go. Vince's big day. Yay, Vince!  You know, I thought I would feel sorry for me,  but, I mean, actually, I feel sorry for Vince.  This guy he's marrying is a real snooze.  I was looking at his social media all morning.  I mean, first of all, he's a retweeter.  So not an original thought in his head.  And on Instagram, he's a food poster.  And not just, like, meals. I mean, like, snacks.  - What, wha - Okay.  I know that something's wrong,  because you're over-plucking your eyebrows.  You look like an extra on "Orange Is the New Black."  - What about you, Curly Sue? - Ow!  Oh, thank you.  Look, am I surprised that Vince  got over his commitment-phobia  with a guy he's known for nine months?  Sure. And am I replaying  the last weeks of our relationship  for clues that I might have missed?  Yes. And does it make me wonder  the real reason for our breakup  if it wasn't his fear of commitment?  Well, of course!  Didn't I just have a coffee here?  It's in the cupboard, Gay Gardens.  - What was I saying? - You were telling a long lie  about how fine you are with Vince's wedding.  Look, I know that you want to know the real reason  for the breakup,  but there's no answer that's not gonna hurt you.  Well, that's just not true.  Okay, all right, what if he says  that it's because he no longer found you attractive  or interesting or fun to be around?  Why would he say that? Did he say that to you?  God, you know, I work so hard to stay in shape.  I never eat anything that I want.  You know, I read. I have good anecdotes.  And I am fun. Like, for instance,  whenever I see a dog, I'll say, "Hello, sir, what's your name?"  Please don't go to this wedding.  You're right. I hate that you're right.  I know you do, but trust me.  I'll cover for you. I already have the perfect excuse.  Just don't make it, like, vomiting or diarrhea.  I'll think of the perfect excuse.    Oh, my God, look at this.  If I had known there would be so many hot guys here,  I would have shaved from the knees up.  Or the chin down.  All these uniforms are throwing off my 'dar.  Like, is that guy standing like that  because of his nightstick?  Or his night stick?  Stay tuned.  Hi, Jared, put your wife on the phone.  Oh, hi, Vanky.  Listen, I want just you to know that I'm gonna win  that scavenger hunt this year.  And I mean actually win it, without help from the Russians.  Oh, loosen your sphincter, Jared.  I didn't know you were still on the line.  Love to the kids!  Ugh, I am so glad Will didn't come to the wedding.  It would have killed him to see Vince so happy.  Ryan seems like a really great guy.  Really? I do not see that.  Quick question, fellas.  What's your favorite TV show of all time?  - "The Wire." - "The Wire."  - "The Wire." - "This Is Us."  - Hi, I'm Jack. - Hi.  I told you not to come.  How many times do we have to have the fight  where we realize I'm always right  before you realize I'm always right?  We were together for five years.  I think he'd be hurt if I didn't show up.  Oh, please, you're here to hock him for answers  - about your breakup. - I'm not here to hock!  I would never hock. I'm not a hocker.  Look, I just I need closure, Grace.  I need to find out why he broke up with me.  - You don't. - It's two minutes of his time.  What could possibly go wrong in two minutes?  Ask every girl who ever got pregnant at her prom.  - Great wedding. - Yeah.  - Want to fool around? - Yeah.  Ah, the thrill of the chase.  Guys, that ceremony was so moving.  I was a wreck.  I was full-on Claire Danes in "Homeland."  - [LAUGHS] - I don't get Showtime.  I mean, we have it. I just don't get it.  Hey, babe, you know what? We should check on your nana.  She's not doing too good. She's got her dentures  sitting next to her in an Arby's bag.  She thinks that's her going-out purse.  Will, I'm really glad you made it.  Ah, me too. Do you have two minutes?  There's just something I want to ask  - now that it's just us - And me!  - Oh, God. - Move it out.  Hey, Vince, great party.  Can't wait to try the meatballs.  I just saw you eat, like, three off one toothpick.  - What are you, a detective? - No, I didn't make it.  Jeez, you gotta rub it in at my wedding?  Okay, pushing me off on Aunt Rita was a dick move,  but we are so going on a cruise.  I just wanted two minutes with the guy.  You know? "Why did we break up?  Oh, that's why, great. Now go marry the guy  who retweeted, 'I got the brunchies.'"  Well, that was fun.  I've copped a feel before, but I've never felt a cop.  Yeah, well, I've never been with a man before, so  Oh. [LAUGHS]  - Oh, you're not kidding. - No.  Wow, I just thought you were really bad.  Which you were.  I've been wanting to do that for so long.  Well, proud to have been your first.  Have a long, gay life. Best of luck, emoji horseshoe,  steamboat, bon voyage.  I love you.  Aw, aren't you sweet, dear?  You're like a baby congressman who's just crawled out  from underneath his first men's room stall.  Let me explain. In the gay world,  what we just did was fun but meaningless.  Okay? A blip.  And now this blip needs to bloop.  I love when you say words that aren't words.  - Okay, listen, Mary - Oh, yes. Oh, my God.  It's happening. I've always wanted a guy to call me Mary.  - Officer Drew. - Yeah?  You're a delightful, muscly rocket ship.  You're what my friend Will and I would call a spinner.  But you and I are never gonna happen, okay?  And you need to absorb that, like, right now.  So breathe it in.  - Do it. - [INHALES]  And then we say  I love you. I love you so much.  [GIGGLES]  I don't get it.  Who would take my nana's dentures  out of an Arby's bag?  I have a hunch.  You're gonna win this scavenger hunt.  Now all you need is a cop badge.  So you're a detective, huh?  Well, you must be good at solving  all sorts of difficult cases,  like murder or how a guy can have a fantastic boyfriend  and not want to make a commitment  but then meet another guy, who I guess is great  I mean, I'm still not seeing it  and have no problem making a commitment.  I got a wife, lamb chop.  Hey, it's Jack, Will's funny friend.  It's me, Angela, Vince's funny cousin.  Oh, right. Yeah, I remember you.  You do all those "SNL" bits.  "I live in a van down by the river."  [BOTH LAUGHING]  Have you met my husband? Babe, come here.  Yeah, what's up, babe?  [CHOKING]  [RETCHING]  I think there was a tiny claw in that.  I thought I saw you guys talking earlier.  Do you know each other?  BOTH: Uh  - I don't think so - I don't know if it was the  Oh, you know what it was?  BOTH: That's what it was, yeah.  I have been begging him to make more male friends.  Here's a crazy idea. We reserved a cabin  in the Poconos. I can't go  because I still have the inner ear thing.  Why don't you guys go and make a boys' weekend out of it?  - BOTH: Oh - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  - I think it's a great idea. - I don't think that's  - I already have the cabin. - I actually have a  We can take my squad car up there, and you know what?  - I love the Poconos. - I hate the Poconos.  But, you know, I would love to go.  But my wife, um  she doesn't like me to go anywhere without her.  Isn't that right, honey?  I don't care what you do.  Then it's a date for two wild and crazy guys!  Hey, Will, Will, come take a picture with us.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hey, did you see the, uh, two gay guys cake topper?  - Yeah. - Yeah, we had to buy  two straight couples and break them apart.  So if you know any lesbians getting married,  tell them we got a cake topper.  Vince, chin up a little bit.  That's too much. You look like a Pez dispenser.  Okay, can we just take the picture?  Sure. Oh, can we get the, uh  sorry, can we get the salad dressing off the table?  - What for? - Well, so when you look  at your wedding pictures, you're not staring  at a tacky gravy boat of green goddess.  You're a tacky gravy boat of green goddess!  See, this is why I didn't want him to come.  Hey, baby, it's okay. He didn't mean it.  No, I think he meant it.  Why didn't you want me to come, Vince?  'Cause I knew you would do this.  Do what, try to make your wedding photos look good?  No, pick! Man, you pick at everything.  The way I sit, the way I chew,  the way I say "Verranzano Bridge."  - There's no N in the middle. - And I like green goddess.  Oh, it's a stupid, ridiculous salad dressing.  Why is it green? There's no avocado in it.  It's green onions!  Or as adults like to say, scallions!  - See, this is why we broke up. - Aha, aha, ah.  The mystery's about to be solved.  See, I thought you broke up with me  because you weren't ready to make a commitment.  But clearly, it's something wrong with me.  You thought there was always something wrong with me.  Always picking and criticizing, like you were better than me,  like I embarrassed you.  You want to know why I dumped you, Will?  Because you didn't like me.  [BRIGHT PIANO MUSIC]  So, Ryan, I love your husband.  And it's not because I had to go  for mandatory sensitivity training  for drawing on his locker.  [THINKING] What's wrong with me?  Why would I sabotage a relationship that was as good  as the one I had with Vince?  I now know that words can hurt.  And so can a cartoon of a rectum  with a rainbow flag coming out of it.  [THINKING] I feel so bad for Will.  But why doesn't he listen to me?  I'm always right.  I'm such a good friend.  I wish I was my friend.  Cheers, queers.  And I can say that,  because it's all about tone and intention.  [THINKING] Do I have the power  to turn straight men gay?  And why didn't that work in high school?  [THINKING] Down one point to Ivanka frickin' Drumpf.  If I could just get a cop badge,  I could win that 40 bucks.  - You okay? You want to go home? - Not yet.  - Excuse me? - [GLASS CLINKING]  I'd like to make a toast.  Vince, you found someone who loves you  for exactly who you are.  Wish I could have done that, but instead I picked on you.  Everything. Your beard grew too fast.  You chewed gum like an alpaca.  All that jaw movement  My God, it's like a disease.  [EXHALES DEEPLY]  I didn't deserve you.  Maybe I don't deserve anybody  'cause I'm a sad, tragic, lonely man.  Good health, long life.  - [APPLAUSE] - [GLASS CLINKING]  Guys, I'd like to make a toast.  Will, you are being way too hard on yourself.  Of course you're a little controlling,  but it's only because you want to  bring out the best in people.  No one is more deserving of love than you.  Vince and Ryan, you too.  - [APPLAUSE] - [GLASS CLINKING]  No, no, no, thank you, Grace,  but I am awful, and I have to own that.  Again, all the happiness in the world.  - [GLASS CLINKING] - If you are so awful,  why did Vince stay with you for five years?  Mazel tov.  - [GLASS CLINKING RAPIDLY] - I don't know. I don't know.  'Cause I can cook, and I'm really good in bed.  All all all love, all love.  - I'd like to make a toast. - Thank God.  Will, I'm sorry about all that stuff I said before.  Grace is right. There was a lot of love in our relationship.  That doesn't diminish what we have.  And to tell the truth, I'll always think of you  as the one that got away.  You're the one that didn't get away.  Why am I working so hard? You got, like, three exes here.  You see? He loved you.  - Everyone loves you. - You're a good friend.  I am.  I really am.  I'm sorry, does anyone have a real toast?  - I do. - [GLASS CLINKING]  There is a cop in this room  who has just had his first gay experience.  He is feeling confused and thinks he's in love.  Not you!  But this proves my point.  There's plenty of men out there.  There's too much fun to be had.  Never, never, never fall in love.  It won't work.  To the two of you, God bless.  Okay, that's our cue. DJ, hit it.  [LIGHT PARTY MUSIC PLAYING]  Honey, hi, quick question.  Is it illegal if you cut blow with aspirin?  - It's still cocaine, ma'am. - Mm, all right.  Well, hope nobody asks to borrow an aspirin from me.  [LAUGHS] You feel me?  - Will you excuse me, ma'am? - Oh, yeah.  Suck it, Ivanka!  Did you just steal a badge from a cop?  Did you just eat an entire tray of sliders?  I'll keep your secret if you keep mine.  Will, I need to talk to you. I'm freaking out.  [EXHALES DEEPLY]  Tell me I'm not making a mistake with Ryan.  It's what you do, Will.  You always tell me when I do something wrong.  - You didn't make a mistake. - Yeah, but are you sure?  I mean, I thought he was  the "Godfather II" to my "Godfather I,"  but what if we're actually "Godfather III"?  You think you're gonna see Bobby Duvall,  and boom, they hit you with George Hamilton.  Vince, you're spinning. That's what you do.  If you of all people can make a commitment after nine months,  Ryan must be pretty special.  He is. And I know that.  I think I just needed to hear you say it, so thanks.  Of course.  - Congratulations. - Thanks.  - You know, what we had was good. - Yeah, it was.  And I know I didn't have the guts  to make this marriage thing work with you,  but for what it's worth  I'll always think of you as my ex-husband.  Me too.  - Shh, shh. Quiet, quiet, quiet. - Wait, are we alone?  Police!     
                




                    			1 "Will & Grace" is shot before a live studio audience.  Will, said with love,  I really do hope I look like you  when I go through man-opause.  You're gonna have to go through puberty first.  You seem oddly happy.  Have you been watching videos  of girls burning off their bangs with flat irons?  [LAUGHING] They're so devastated!  I am happy, Will.  Things are great with my boo, Drew.  Are you still seeing that married cop from Staten Island,  or as Grace and I like to call him when you're not around,  your Staten Island Fairy?  I'm using that and not crediting you.  I really like him.  In fact, today is our one month-iversary.  Congratulations.  Isn't one month traditionally the time  when a gay husband comes out to his wife?  I believe the, uh the gift for that  is a suitcase.  He better not come out. It would ruin everything.  There's nothing better than being with  a closeted married man.  Spoken like a true Scientologist.  How are you pulling this off?  His wife thinks I'm straight and married to Karen.  Ah.  It's the perfect situation.  No strings attached.  No "Where is this going?"  "What is your middle name?"  "What is your last name?"  "What is your name?"  Okay, I'm gonna say something that you may not want to hear.  No, you're the one who's gained weight!  I mean, it's like  Not what I was gonna say.  Isn't this just an ancient gay clichÃ©  where you go from unavailable guy  to unavailable guy  because you're afraid of commitment and intimacy?  How dare you?  I have asked plenty of men to put a ring on it.  Just not on my finger.  Will, I just got amazing news!  Grace got an STD!  I did not say "STD."  I said "QVC."  Well, they're both ways to get something cheap  that looks awful.  Will, we got the gig!  We are selling  Grace by Grace Adler Designs bed linens  on QVC!  I knew it was gonna happen.  I know I kept saying, "It's not gonna happen,  it's not gonna happen,"  but that's what I said about election night,  and look what happened there.  This is huge. Karen, we're gonna have to  do a lot of work to get ready for this.  I'm sorry, honey, were you saying something?  Let's get out of here.  Did you hear Will put on a few pounds?  Well, Grace has an STD.  Okay.  We got a lot of decisions to make.  First things first:  Who's gonna be our spokesperson?  - I have someone perfect in mind. - So do I.  Someone who already knows the product.  Someone who's easy on the eyes.  I think it's pretty obvious.  BOTH: It should be me. What, you?  No! Stop doing that!  You stop doing that!  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   QVC wants to sell  Grace by Grace Adler Design bed linen.  Who better to sell that than Grace Adler?  Well, how about Grace Adler's business partner  who spent four days doing the market research  that got us this gig,  while Grace Adler sat in her pajamas,  watching videos of cats and elephants  clean their babies?  That is my brain chocolate, Will.  I need that to create.  And I don't need market research.  I have been selling my designs to clients my entire career.  This is QVC. It's a different demographic.  They their customers want aspirational and polish.  You're more perspirational and Polish.  Will, they want someone they can relate to,  not just a bunch of focus group jargon.  Look, this is live TV, Grace.  You got to be quick on your feet.  You were kicked out of your college improv troupe.  Excuse me!  The She-nanigans and I  had a mutual parting of the ways.  Yes, you both mutually agreed that you were terrible.  You didn't even know how to obey the first rule of improv,  which is to follow every suggestion with a "yes, and"  Well, being quick on your feet doesn't matter  if the audience finds you smirky and smug.  I'm not smirky and smug!  Oh, I didn't say you were,  but the fact that you thought  that I was talking about you is pretty telling.  Grace, our company is only gonna get one shot at this.  Now, I have done the research.  I know what has to be said.  It's all in this binder.  Okay, binder boy.  I will take a look at this tonight,  but it is my design, my name, and I am doing it.  Are you seriously pulling rank on me?  Yes, and!  Yes, and  This is exactly how they tripped me up  in the She-nanigans.  [LIGHT JAZZ MUSIC]  [UPBEAT JAZZ PIANO MUSIC]  [LAUGHS] Staten Island Fairy?  You are hilarious!  I know. I just thought of it.  I'm letting Will use it. He needs it more than I do.  She's not a clever girl, that one.  Ah, I-I love when gay guys call men "she."  Do you ever call your skinny gay friends fat?  From time to time.  You are so cute.  And I love that you still have that new gay smell.  Okay, Google, take a selfie.  Oh, my first picture as a gay guy.  I look so straight.  Do you know where I could get some ass-less chaps?  All chaps are ass-less.  That's why they're awesome.  And you, mister, just blew your Christmas present.  [IMITATING SIREN]  Woman on premises!  Put away the "Playboys."  What are you bozos up to?  Oh, just two heterosexual bros  watching the big game.  That is "Real Housewives."  Uh, well, we changed it  because the Jets game was a blowout, so  Ugh, classic Jets. Who were they playing?  - The Sharks. - Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it's Jets versus the Sharks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, hockey, not football.  Yeah. I don't know if you know,  but the Jets and the Sharks are old rivals.  It started out as harmless pranks and dancing,  until Riff and Bernardo pulled out their blades.  I do not understand hockey.  Have fun, you two.  Thanks, Angie.  Wouldn't say no to some pizza rolls.  [SNAPS FINGERS]  She's great.  I just wish we didn't have to keep you and I a secret.  I know.  Mm, it's the worst.  I mean, wouldn't it be great  if we could see each other whenever we wanted?  [FLATLY] Oh, I'm so mad that we can't.  Society! Oh    Okay, people, 30 minutes  to Grace Adler Design on stage B.  Stage A, stand by.  We got Lisa Rinna flying in  with malachite pendants and adult diapers.  Excuse me, miss, have you seen Grace Adler?  - She's late. - Yes, let me drop  everything I'm doing 'cause a man asked me to.  What what I'm hearing is  is that you wouldn't be open to getting me a Diet Coke.  [LAUGHS]  This is fun. This is gonna be our thing.  Oh! Sorry.  You were supposed to be here an hour ago.  There was a little mix-up on the subway.  Okay, you're on in 30 minutes.  Let's just let's review the material in the binder.  - Where's the binder? - On the subway.  That was the mix-up.  You lost the binder?  Please tell me you memorized it first.  Well, I could tell you  that I memorized it, but  - You're Grace Adler, right? - Mm-hmm.  Okay, we've got a little change of plans here.  Lisa Rinna canceled.  She just booked a Hallmark movie.  - You're on next. - What?  What what are you talking about?  I think she plays a witch  trying to raise her daughter in a small town.  When is this happening?  They're shooting now, so I I guess Christmas.  No, no, what  When is this happening?  Uh, in 40 seconds. On a bell!  - 40 seconds? - That's not good.  Is there is there any way I can give her live feedback?  I mean, you could probably tweet at Hallmark  while the movie's airing, but it's not gonna be live.  Not Lisa.  Can you give me an earpiece so that I can  I can talk to Grace, tell her what she needs to say?  Oh, sure thing,  'cause a woman can't think for herself?  Cheryl, my penis has done nothing to hurt you.  I need an IFB earpiece  and a comm mic.  We're going live in 30 seconds.  An earpiece, really?  Okay, okay, fine,  but I am freaking out,  so just keep it simple.  Of course I'll keep it simple.  You just need to emphasize  our affordability, practicality,  and versatility to the best of your ability.  - What? - 15 seconds.  Uh, and remember to smile.  Not like the clown from "It."  Yeah, better, and be relatable,  but but don't try to be funny.  But have fun.  But but don't laugh.  You snort when you laugh.  What else? Oh, oh, um, um  Favor your left side, okay?  It's easy to remember, because your right side,  for you, is your wrong side.  So, um  Oh and and don't say "moist."  People hate the word "moist."  Why would that come up selling linens?  I'm just telling you what the research says.  You're on in ten. Come on.  - Oh! - Don't worry.  This does not have to be a disaster.  Disaster? Who said disaster?  Doesn't matter who said it. It's been said.  Oh, the most important thing  this is the thing not to forget.  - Yeah? - In three  Forget it.  Hi, I'm Grace Adler.  Hi, I'm Grace Adler.  Do you love your linens?  Because moist people don't.  [MOUTHING WORDS]  I I didn't  I didn't mean to say "most."  Moist people don't.  I  Can we cut to a commercial?  This is QVC, dude. We are the commercial.    [UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC]  Trust me, Drew,  no good has ever come  from a man coming out to his wife.  Don't you want to be vice president one day?  But if I'm gay,  isn't coming out of the closet a good thing?  It was once,  but you know how people used to think  eggs were good for you,  but then we discovered they weren't?  But eggs are good for you.  Tell that to the chicken who just lost a child.  My point is, nobody knows anything about anything.  Whoop! Whoop!  Wives entering premises!  Hello, husband.  Hello, wife. [LAUGHS]  BOTH: Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  So romantic.  Why don't we kiss like that?  It's a cop thing, Ang, okay?  If I get the flu,  people die.  Wait a minute.  This place reminds me of something.  That cat clock  When I was little, I was in a room just like this  with my mother  And I was saying  Mommy, why were you wrestling  with that man who wasn't Daddy?  And she said,  Oh, honey,  I know that looked like wrestling,  but actually,  we were having sex.  The important thing is,  you can't tell Daddy.  But I hate secrets.  You know what helps me?  A little comfort  from the South.  This is alcohol!  I'm not supposed to drink.  Now we both have secrets.  [ETHEREAL CHIME]  Why did we have to know that?  Because secrets ruin lives,  and here's the truth.  He's gay. He's gayer.  They're gay together.  And, honey, you don't want to be married  to a big 'mo,  or in this case,  a little 'mo.  Karen.  [TIMER DINGS]  There's never a good time to say this, but  I think the pizza rolls are ready.  [JAZZ MUSIC]    Thanks for staying with us  on the Grace by Grace Adler Design linen showcase.  We just have How many minutes left?  Uh, 28. You've only been talking for two minutes.  Oy vey.  Less Jewish.  Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.  Remember to smile.  Easy, Pennywise.  Okay.  Right now,  I would like to talk to you about, um  Talk about value.  I would like to talk about value.  And then mention mention price point.  I would like to talk to you about value  And then pivot into the phrase  "affordable luxury."  I would like to talk about value  and a second thing  and something affordable something.  What are you doing? You're bombing.  Okay, I am done with you, Will.  I'm doing me.  [SOUTHERN ACCENT] I had to get this man out of my hair.  Did she just take out her earpiece?  Not so fun when the puppet cuts her strings, is it?  Yeah, look, this isn't working.  What other set can we get ready in a hurry?  No, no, no, no, no, I can I can save this.  I could bore you  with a lot of facts from a missing binder,  but let's talk about creating a personal aesthetic.  That sounds great, Grace,  but what about price point?  What are you doing?  I just want to remind our viewers  that they could spend up to three times as much  on a comparable luxury linen.  - What is happening? - How nice.  My partner, Will Truman, has joined us,  because apparently,  he knows everything about everything.  [LAUGHS]  I I just hate to waste an opportunity  to talk about a great, affordable sheet,  especially when it might be  the only opportunity we ever have.  So you want to talk about this sheet?  'Cause I would love  to talk sheet to you right now.  Yeah? [CHUCKLES]  Well, let the sheet-talking begin.  [BELL RINGS]  Stand by for Ruben Studdard's  Big & Bold Collection on stage C.  Did you just kill our segment?  I euthanized your segment.  Good going!  You just blew this for us!  Oh, I blew this for us? You weren't selling any  Why the hell did you cut away from them?  The callers loved the drama.  Turn the cameras back on!  Fine, uh, but know as your employee,  I feel demeaned by your tone.  I hear you and I respect what you are saying,  and I am not asking as your boss.  I am asking  as your husband.  God, you turn me on.  Oh, you want to get into this now?  'Cause I will so get into this with you now.  - Let's get into it! - Okay, buckle up!  Click!  Okay, I admit it. This is good TV.    [UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC]  I'm still not talking to you.  Do you realize  how many lives you've ruined  with your truth bomb?  After we left, Angela  poor, sweet, unsuspecting Angela  confessed she suspected all along!  She told Drew, and I quote,  "Live your truth and be happy."  Drew, in turn, wished her the best,  and offered to set her up on OkCupid.  His mother and co-workers  are throwing him a coming out party!  We're both invited! This is on you, lady!  Poodle, I'm so sorry.  Sorry's not good enough, Karen.  I hate it when you use my Christian name.  It's too real.  It is real. I'm really mad at you.  I don't know what came over me.  I don't even believe in love.  I set up the Steve Mnuchins!  Would it help if you slapped me across the face  as hard as you can?  That is completely ridiculous  and absolutely worth a shot.  All right, one shot.  As hard as you can. I deserve it.  [CELL PHONE CHIMES]  Oh, it's Drew. He says he wants to  Ow! What'd you do that for?  I don't know! I don't know!  All right, all right. All right, try it again.  Your best shot.  [CELL PHONE CHIMES]  Oh, crap, he's on his way up,  and he says he's  Stop hitting me!  Oops.  [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]  - He's here. - Don't worry, honey.  I'll take care of it.  Hey, guys.  I'm here, I'm queer, and I'm getting used to it.  [ALL LAUGHING]  Oh, my God, that's so funny!  [ALL LAUGHING]  Drew, there's something very important  I'd like to say to you.  Karen.  Listen, piglet, we need to talk.  Oh, before I forget,  Angela wanted me to give you this.  She thought you seemed into it.  Oh, no.  It's happening again.  I'm with my mother,  and she's saying  Baby, we're leaving.  Your stepdad had a shaving accident.  I thought you loved Daddy number five!  Nope. You want to be happy, kid?  Don't fall in love.  I never did. [HICCUPS]  And look how happy I am!  What are you looking at?  [SOMBER JAZZ MUSIC]  But she wasn't happy.  She lied to herself and everyone else.  She went from man to man and ended up dying alone  at a craps table.  She died in a casino?  [QUIETLY] No.  But the point is, you like this guy.  If you don't take a chance on love,  you could end up just like my mom,  sad and alone.  I can't. I  I have HOMO FOMO.  Fear of missing out on another 'mo.  It's a never-ending buffet of men out there.  What if I pick the stale cookie  right as they bring out the cheesecake?  But can't I be the cheesecake?  Drew, it's not about you.  Honey, if I were you, I wouldn't be as worried  about HOMO FOMO.  I'd be more worried about SLO-LO-MO  slowly turning into a lonely 'mo.  I'm gonna leave you two to kiss it out  or punch it out or  rub your butts together  or whatever it is you two do.  So, what do you say, Jack?  This is such a predicament.  - On the one hand - You want to be with me.  This is a monologue, dear.  On the one hand, I want to be with him.  On the other hand, I want to be with other hands.  It's just such a risk.  A risk?  I left my wife.  Yeah, that  that is pretty big.  Look, I'm not asking for forever.  Can we just start with one night?  - Fine, one night. - Yes.  I can't promise any more.  Unless you want to do brunch.  I'm really into brunch, so we'd be doing that.  Oh, my God, first gay brunch.  Turkey bacon with a side of fruit.  I've been wanting to order that since puberty.  But then that's it!  36 hours, and then you'll go.  Unless we decide to binge-watch "Riverdale."  - Deal? - Deal.  Ugh, I have so much to teach you.  [SNAPS FINGERS]    Sweetie, I'm sorry.  No, I'm sorry.  No  You created everything here, and it's amazing,  and I should've just let you do it your way  and left you alone.  I didn't listen to you,  and the collection is affordable and versatile  and practical and all the things  that you wanted me to say.  I just hate that our nonsense  got in the way of us selling something  I'm so proud of.  I hate that it got in the way of us.  Yeah, me too.  You know I love you.  I love you too.  [BELL RINGS]  And that's a wrap  on the Grace Adler Design linen showcase.  BOTH: What?  We were on camera this whole time?  Yeah. I don't usually go for  all that heteronormative stuff,  but there is something strangely compelling  about the two of you.  What are you talking about?  The viewers loved you. Look at these tweets.  [SCOFFS]  Tweets are up here, Charlie.  "Love seeing a real married couple,  warts and all."  "They're just like me and my husband.  "He kept trying to talk about his thing  and the wife was a hot mess."  Oh, she thinks I'm hot.  Wait, does this mean we sold some sheets?  Oh, you sold everything.  Will!  We did it!  Oh! [LAUGHING]  Okay, okay, camera's off.  I am so proud of us!  Let's get a drink and celebrate!  BOTH: You're buying. Me?  I bought last time. Fine, I'll buy.  Stop doing that!  Okay, this is crazy. Pick a number.  - 36. - 19.  BOTH: Oh, thank God. How?     
                




                    			1 "Will & Grace" is recorded in front of  a live studio audience.  - Mmm. - [LAUGHS]  - Is this weird? - No, I think it's so sweet  that you go "Mm" every time we kiss.  It's like I'm on a tasting menu.  [LAUGHS] No, I I  I meant that we live in the same building.  I mean, that's not a problem, right?  That part's great.  - Good night. - Okay.  [SIGHS]  - Where have you been, missy? - Oh, God!  Your mother and I have been worried sick.  Grace Louise, if you're in a family way,  we'll raise it as your little sister  - even if it's a boy. - Mm.  So how was the date?  Uhh! So good!  Tell me everything!  What's his name? What's his favorite "Real Housewife"?  Where did you meet him?  James. He's straight.  The laundry room, last week.  Big whoop. I fooled around with two guys at a laundry mat.  First I fluffed them and then I folded them.  Of course, this was before I was in  a monogamous relationship with my boyfriend Drew.  You are really getting good at saying that.  You don't make that pinched anus face anymore.  - I've been practicing. - Mm.  So how's your mom doing with it?  Oh, sadly, Mother's not on board.  It gets in way of her dream of us retiring together.  So how's this gonna work  you dating a guy in the building?  'Cause I've seen you get the mail  in nothing but a mud mask and that big t-shirt  that says, "It was me. I let the dogs out."  James and I are adults.  There's no reason why this has to be weird or complicated.  - All right. - [CELL PHONE RINGING]  [GASPS] Ooh! Mmm.  Hi, James.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Okay. Mm-hmm.  Okay.  It's over. James thinks it's too weird and complicated.  What? He broke up with you?  Okay. [SIGHS] You know the drill.  We'll open wine, I'll find sugar.  There's frozen pie crust.  Do you want me to thaw it or do you just wanna  go at it as it is, it's your call.  Now, I'm gonna show you how to get over a guy  - the gay way. - Does it involve cardio?  - Kind of. - Ugh.  Mother always said the best way to get over one guy  is to get under, behind and sideways with another one.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   All right.  I am off to the tennis club.  I know what you're thinking, didn't I  already work out this morning?  Yes, but if I burn off a few more calories  after work, I can hit the Pressed Juicery.  I know, those things are pure sugar.  But what can I say? I love 'em.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, my God. I didn't know  this was gonna be a story about juice.  You know what? Back it up, start from the beginning  and really drag it out this time.  Okay?  You know what's great about us working together  and being around each other all day now?  'Cause I don't.  All the hens in the accounting department  think you're a drip.  I am the accounting department.  Then you know.  Good-bye.  [MEN ARGUING IN SPANISH]  - What are you watching? - M'story.  It's called "M'Servants,"  filmed live from m'kitchen.  - You spy on your staff? - More than that.  I control everything that happens in the manse  from this phone.  Alarms, temperature, music,  when it's time for the INS duck and cover.  It's like an interactive telenovela.  Check it. Margot's greatest fear  is having to tell the missus that she broke  yet another tray of glasses.  - [ALARM BLARING] - [GLASS SHATTERS]  They're Waterford. It'll take her years to pay me back.  This is this is the most invasive,  morally bankrupt thing I  jeez Louise, those guys are hot.  Yeah, well, they wouldn't be on TV if they weren't.  It's not the BBC.  [ARGUING IN SPANISH] That's Cook  and that's Pastry Chef.  My theory is they're fighting over a girl.  But it's hard to be sure because they speak  in their secret code.  You mean Spanish?  Whoa, did you see that smoldering look?  I think they're in love.  That's sexual tension.  It's the same look Lindsey Graham gives John McCain.  - They're gay? - Mm-hmm.  They don't look alike.  Karen, we shouldn't be watching them like this.  Come to my desk. I have a bigger screen.  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  What about him? He looks straight.  You're into that now, right?  Hooking up with a stranger it's not me.  Because you're a prude.  I'm not a prude.  I've had sex in an elevator.  In the words of the horse-loving beauty  Shania Twain  that don't impress me much.  [CELL PHONE RINGS]  Oh, it's my mother.  She can't stand it when I don't pick up.  And decline.  Oh, my God. Hello.  So she wants to drive a Silverado.  - Grace Adler. - [LAUGHS]  Well, what a surprise.  Oh, Jack, Jack, um  this is Jerry Wise,  - my college lit professor. - Hello.  Professor Wise is a legend.  I mean, so inspirational.  He used to say, I would rather be a success as a fish  than a failure as a fish  trying to be a bird.  I don't get that.  Well, I hope that you're still being a fish.  Oh, please. Me a bird?  None of this means anything, right?  Grace, it's very nice seeing you again.  BOTH: Bye.  - I slept with him in college. - Impressed?  Please, I fooled around with so many professors  in college and they all magna came loudly.  Karen, I love this show, but the will-they-won't-they  - is killing me. - Honey, I've turned  the heat up as high as it'll go,  but there's still no gay porn.  [LAUGHS]  That's 'cause a good gay porno  needs the right kinda music.  Or so I've read in academic journals.  [BOTH SPEAKING IN SPANISH]  [SIGHS, MUTTERS]  - Ohh. - It's happening.  It's happening!  [FUNKY MUSIC PLAYS]  [SPEAKING SPANISH]  - So close! - Devil!  [SIGHS] Okay, we blew it  with the music, that's on me.  That's it. I'm switching over to my limo.  When we last left Driver, he was upside down in a ditch.  No, no, no, no, no. I'm  I'm too invested in the love story.  Well, so am I.  Gosh, I haven't rooted this hard for a gay couple  to get together on TV since Frasier and Niles.  They were brothers.  I know.  What do you think they're saying?  What's keeping these two guys apart?  If only we could break their secret code!  Yeah. Again, Spanish.  [COMPUTER RINGING]  - Hi, sexy. - Ah!  It's the Verizon Guy!  Hi, Neil. Can I can I mute you a sec?  Ugh, rescheduling a second date with this guy for years.  Every time I think I'm rid of him, he pops back up  like Geraldo Rivera.  Hey, Neil.  Tonight's on the books, stud.  "Friday night, Will gets Neiled.  Eggplant, eggplant, smiley face."  The smiley face will be yours.  Uh, I I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cancel again.  No! No, Mama.  [SPEAKING SPANISH]  - Moms, right? - He knows the servants'  secret code!  That's right, his mom's from Argentina.  It's the one interesting thing about him.  So lover, about tonight?  - I think tonight will work. - Mm-hmm.  Can you pop by the office?  So you wanna play secretary, huh?  Take a little dick-tation  - from Mr - Okay, bye.  - Go flirt with someone! - No, Jack.  Let's just go home.  Women are different.

I wasn't doing anything.  Huh.  Well, I know you weren't looking at porn because  the fish ain't jumping and the cotton ain't high.  I clicked on a link that said  "Ten Pictures of Gay Men Laughing with Salads"  and somehow ended up on my ex-boyfriend's Instagram page.  Well, she just came over to take some money,  but now her interest is piqued.  - Her zipper's down. - She knows.  [ZIPPER ZIPS]  - So, who is it? - No.  Come on. We all stalk our exes.  Just this morning I was checking out  that big hairy one of mine who thought he was spiritual.  Oh, you mean Yogi Bear?  It was impossible to keep that bear from  poking around in my trashcan, if you catch my drift.  Spill it, lady. Who is it?  I was checking out Michael.  Michael? So how's he look?  Better than he has a right to.  He does not look good.  That's him in my first apartment.  I was 26 when he moved in.  Tap it twice.  Hm. There's a little heart.  What why is there a little heart?  You just liked it.  I don't want to like it!  I don't want him to know I was here!  - Undo it! - Relax!  Just tap it again, Insta-grandma.  Kill me now.  Okay, I'll get the shovel, you start the car.  Ellen's niece invited me to her baby shower.  Another afternoon tea, which is code for "not enough food"  and a group of mommies all giving me that  "I'm sorry you don't have children" hi.  Hi.  Oh, the mean girl head tilt.  The reason I had a stiff neck in high school.  Not the only reason.  I hate baby showers.  They always feel like a test I failed.  Eh, it's two hours of your life.  Besides, those women can't make you feel bad,  because you are doing great.  Your business is successful.  You look fantastic. Who am I kidding?  [LAUGHING] It's gonna be awful.  I RSVP'd for the both of us.  [LAUGHING]  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   One pound of prosciutto,  one pound of mortadella,  five types of cheese, from mild to stinky,  big vat of coleslaw almost done.  You ordering a deli platter?  Having phone sex with Stan.  Two rashers of bacon.  Oh.

How's work?"  Let's say for a second that  you don't want to ruin the party,  uh, you may want to try what my family does.  Your family doesn't say anything.  Exactly.  See, when a Truman is seething with rage,  we simply jot down the worst possible thing we could say.  - Then read it out loud? - No.  - Mail it? - No.  Oh, hide it somewhere so they find it in, like, spring?  No. No.  We we take those terrible thoughts,  crumple them up, stuff them in our pockets.  - So WASP-y. - Mm-hmm.  - That works? - It does.  I can't imagine hugging my mom at Christmas  and not hearing the crackling of a crumpled paper in her pocket.  So weird  and so cold.  I'm gonna try it.  - Oh, thank you. - Mm-hmm.  [PAPER CRACKLES]  [PAPER CRACKLES]  Sweetie, you're not easy.  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]    - Excuse me? - Hm.  [FLICKS WRIST]  [PILL WHOOSHING]  Ah.  Hey-ho!  What?  How long do we have to stay in that office?  It's really hot and stuffy.  Oh, honey, I feel for you, but  you're doing scenes from "Diary of Anne Frank,"  where everyone hides quietly in the attic.  We're doing "Annie."  Well, they're both adopted by bald millionaires  and had scrappy little dogs!  Well, Mr. McFarland said that we were gonna  Well, Mr. McFarland is not here, is he?  - [ELEVATOR DINGS] - Uh-oh, better hurry back.  The Nazis could be here any minute.  - [STOMPING FEET] - Oh, no, here they come.  So shut-enzee mouth and close-enzee door.  I got your 80 feet of red velvet curtains  and six boxes of tassels.  Wait a minute, they were supposed to be  cut to size with the tassels attached.  Look at the form.  "Do you want the tassels attached?"  Checked no.  "Do you want the fabric cut?" Checked no.  And this one.  "For the last time, do you want  the tassels attached or the fabric cut?"  Also checked no.  Signed "Karen Walker."  Okay, let's agree that  mistakes were made on both sides.  But these need to be delivered to the hotel bar today!  I don't have time to ship these to a sweatshop in Malaysia.  Where am I supposed to find  tiny, nimble hands to cut and sew?    Look at this place.  It's like prom, but the pregnancy's out in the open.  Is it clear enough Rose Mary's having a girl?  Why don't they just hang vaginas from this  Hi, Ellen!  - Hi! - How are you?  - Hey. - Hi.  - [KISSES] You look great. - Oh, thanks.  It's all duct tape and scaffolding.  I am so jealous of women without kids  who have time to exercise.  Excuse me, I hardly ever exercise.  That's a weird brag.  Grace, how's work?  Just one second. [SOFT CHUCKLE]  [PEN CLICKS]  Work's great.  Um, what are you writing?  Oh, just something for work.  If I don't write it down, I'll forget it.  Oh, I'd say you have "Mom brain" but  But I'm not a mom! [LAUGHING]  Look what I wrote.  Wow, I didn't think you were allowed to say that anymore.  Women can still say it.  [CLEARS THROAT]  Hello.  Yeah, I deserved that.  "Hello" was a big ask.  No. No-no-no-no, oh!  [EXHALES]  What?  Nothing.  Probably fantasy sports.  Fantasy sports are literally so dumb.  Fantasy sports make me want to actually die.  It's not fantasy sports.  I missed a call from an ex I haven't spoken to in 15 years.  Oh. Did she leave a message?  "He." And no, no message.  BOTH: Oh!  He's totally breadcrumbing you.  "Breadcrumbing"?  Yeah, like when you want to flirt  but you want to keep the power.  So you put a little bread crumb out  to get them to come to you like a little bunny.  Like Braedon does to you all the time, Ilana.  He does not, Brianna!  Well, that is not what this is.  And I am definitely not a little bunny.  [SOFT SCOFF]  But but if  if some guy was breadcrumbing you,  what what would you do?  I for sure don't call him back.  Or text. And I won't Snap him.  At most, you can like one of his pics on Insta.  What if you already did? By accident.  And and the post was from three years ago?  Shut up.  You deep-liked him?  - I don't know, maybe. - What what's "deep-like" mean?  When you like something from deep in your crush's feed.  I deep-liked him so hard.  This is bad.  But but I unliked the photo immediately,  so, you know, unless he was he was looking at  his account the moment it happened.  I mean, it's just coincidence he called today, right?  Brianna?  Ilana?  If his notifications are on,  he knew the second you deep-liked him.  That's why he breadcrumbed you.  Oh, God, I'm a little bunny.    No matter how many times I do this, it never gets easier.  Are you ready?  We found his body under the Williamsburg Bridge  Do you remember me?  Who is this? Why is this corpse talking?  - You don't remember me. - That it's okay.  It's a little hurtful, but  You meet a lot of people. So do I.  I remembered you, but whatever.  Let's just go again. Let's just go again.  Whoever you are, you're supposed to be a corpse  so you shouldn't be talking.  Of course. That's a good note. Thank you.  [CLAPPERBOARD CLACKS]  Are you ready?  [SOFT CRYING]  Backup dancer?  Cut it!  Summer of ought-four? Waiting for tonight   Is this Liotta's nephew?  [CLAPPERBOARD CLACKS]  [SOFT CRYING]  I'm sorry, just, quick question.  Her son just died.  Would Mom have this much time  for a wash and set?  [CLAPPERBOARD CLACKS]  We are going to find whoever did this to your son.  [CRACKS UP LAUGHING]  - What - [LAUGHING]  I'm so sorry.  Good one for the gag reel, though.  [LAUGHING]  I'm sorry, back to one.

She knows my name.  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]    I mean, am I wrong? There's no boyfriends in any  of Michael's pictures recently.  So who took this one at his birthday?  - It's a selfie. - Look at his shoulder.  That's why it's cropped all weird.  [SCOFFS] He was alone on his birthday.  Shut up.  Will, these women are so much more hateful  and judgmental and passive-aggressive  than I ever could have dreamed possible.  And I am loving it! Look.  Wow, you're like the world's most obvious shoplifter.  Being a WASP is awesome.  [CLEARS THROAT]  Poor Michael.  It's so sad when old people are single and alone.  He's not that old.  And there's nothing sad about being single  unless being single makes you sad.  Um, literally, what?  I'm just saying, I'm not in a relationship  and I'm fine.  Besides, even if I met someone now,  how long till we move in together  and then get married  and then start a family?  The math isn't great.  Maybe that's why  you're lurking this Michael guy so hard.  Because you have history, so you can skip all that.  Huh.  Instant serious relationship.  [EXHALES] It's just like me and Braedon.  Shut up about Braedon, Ilana.  You guys kissed once in a play in seventh grade!  There were four performances, Brianna!  So, what happens if you don't pick up the bread crumbs?  The possibility goes away.  Then you have to start all over with somebody new.  [SIGHS] Dating is so stupid.  It's the actual worst.  I literally hate it so much.    [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  This one's your best.  Hey, Kar'.  [GASPS] Poodle, how'd it go?  I left due to creative differences.  I, uh  I wanted to stay and they wanted me to leave, so.  But at least I learned a  I, Tonya Harding! what's going on here?  I'm bringing jobs back to America.  You turned your office into a sweatshop?  Karen, their parents are gonna be here at 4:30  expecting to see a scene from "Annie."  I gotta rehearse these kids!  You're not rehearsing those kids.  Those curtains need to be sewn by 5:00!  Well, then we have a problem,  because there is literally no way  we can do both at the same time.  Or is there?  ALL:  It's the hard-knock life for us   It's the hard-knock life for us   Very believable.  The orphans really seem mistreated.  ALL:  It's a hard-knock life!     I tell you, with three teenage boys and a husband,  there's not a moment in the day  where someone's not masturbating.  [LAUGHTER]  Tell me about it.  - What do you mean? - You don't have kids.  Yeah, but I know about masturbating teenagers.  I have nothing to add to this.  Your name's Morgan, right?  Thank you.  Oh oh, no. No.  Do I call Michael back just in case  future me might possibly want to keep that door open?  And I'm asking Brianna, 'cause  I totally know what Ilana's gonna say.  If you call him back, you're boyfriends again.  Huh.  My feelings are gone.  - My feelings are gone! - Mazel tov!  Put a gin and tonic in your hands,  start raising show beagles, and you're my mother.  No, no.  No, the awful things that I have been writing are gone.  They must have fallen out of my sweater.  - My God, this is all your fault. - How is it my fault?  Because you made me write my feelings like a WASP  instead of eating them like a Jew!  Relax, I'm sure somebody threw them out.  Hey, everybody. Gather round.  It's time to read the wishes for the baby.  Rose Mary, get up here.  - Oh, God. - There's no reason to think  that your notes are in there.  Just don't panic.  I found a bunch under that sweater.  Okay, you can start panicking now.  So the way the game works is  that we all have to guess who wrote what.  So I'm just gonna pick one and read it out loud.  Oh, no-no-no, but but if you say a wish out loud,  it won't come true, right?  [SOFT LAUGH] That's just for birthdays, Grace.  Did I tell you or what?  "Health, happiness, and a long life."  ALL: Aww.  I I'm guessing that's not one of yours.  I think I know who wrote that one.  Grandma?  Oh! [LAUGHTER]  Grandma. Okay, next one.  Oh why go on?  I mean, how do you top health and happiness?  The answer is you can't.  Game over. Grandma won.  Go, Grandma!  Okay, okay, hang on, Grace.  We have a whole bowl full of beautiful wishes for the baby,  like  "Rot in Hell, you smug little puke."  Who would write that to a baby,  Grandma?  I think we can all agree  that she has ruined this game for everyone.  "If I have to hear another story about an episiotomy,  I'm gonna rip someone a new ass "okay.  I'm no longer on your side.  If they offer a deal, I'm taking it.  At least they don't know it's me.  "Two drunk teens can make a kid in five minutes.  It took me years to make Grace Adler Designs."  Grandma!  Okay, it was me. It was me. I wrote them.  Yeah, we know, Grace.  But you weren't supposed to read them.  I I am so, so sorry.  It's just that baby showers are hard for me, you know?  Because I know that you're all thinking,  "How could she be fulfilled without children?"  Well, how about travel?  Travel is fulfilling.  Even though I hate to travel.  With all the schlepping  and how it screws with your digestion.  Hand to God, two weeks in Italy, not once.  I guess I guess just what I'm trying to say is  I am feeling really judged.  You feel judged? [SOFT SCOFF]  I feel like you judge me, Grace.  Every time you see me, you're always,  "How are the kids?" Like that's all I am.  I don't think that.  Try telling people you've got a master's in chemistry  and spend the day making homemade slime.  Oh, my God!  Why do we keep doing this to ourselves?  I mean, look, if I wanted kids, I would've had kids.  I mean, there a million ways to do it, you know?  Adoption, surrogacy, whatever Ellen did.  I mean, back me up, you were like 100  when you had your last kid.  You know, Rob's always like,  "We don't see Will and Grace enough,"  and I'm always, "We see them the right amount."  I think what I'm trying to say is  I'm happy.  Which means that I made the right choices.  And if you're happy, that means you did too.  And we should be applauding each other.  I have an actual, actual wish for this baby.  I hope that whatever she chooses to do with her life,  that she never has one second  of worrying about what other people think.  To Rosemary's baby.  It's Rose Mary.  Babe, no one's taking that pause.  To being happy with our choices  and having everything we need.  - Lehayim. - [GLASSES CLINK]  BOTH: Aww.  - [KISSES] Oh, I love you. - Love you.  All right, let's go eat cake.  [SOFT LAUGHTER]  [INDISTINCT CHATTER]  Oh, my God, you look so bummed right now.  And you didn't toast.  I'm not sure I have everything I need.  - He's gonna call Michael. - Obvi.  - Can I have your wine? - No.  Uh, do you have any weed?  No.  How awesome was I just now?  You know what, I'm happy I came to this baby shower.  It clarified some stuff.  Yeah. For me, too.  Let's get out of here before everyone sees that  I bought the kid a 12-pack of irregular onesies  from Canal Street.  Hey, um, uh, I'll I'll catch up.  Okay.  [CLEARS THROAT]  Hey, uh, Michael, it's, uh  it's Will.  You're totally texting Braedon.  I am not, Brianna!       
                




                    			1 "Will & Grace" is recorded in front of  a live studio audience.  - [SCREAMS] - [SCREAMS]  Oh, my God, you scared me!  I thought someone was robbing the place!  I'm not robbing the place.  I'm just rifling through drawers, looking for money!  [SCOFFS]  Where is William and his wallet, anyway?  With Michael.  They either went to brunch  or antiquing.  I was still half-asleep,  but I know it was something super-gay.  Grace,  balls on the table,  how do we feel about Will and Michael?  Hey, Will's happy, I'm happy.  You know, I know that Michael  can be a little annoying.  A little? A little?  Did Midge and Moose have a little problem  with jingle-jangle on "Riverdale"?  Anyway, don't you remember  what we hated about Michael the first time?  Yeah, lots.  He enabled Will's George Michael phase.  Ugh, wake me up before I gag-gag.  He overused the expression "vis-Ã -vis."  And now, Will says it all the time.  I only borrow his AmEx  for fear that if I ask for his Visa,  he'll say "vis-Ã -vis."  Wait, what does "vis-Ã -vis" mean again?  "As it pertains to"  [CONDESCENDINGLY] This conversation.  You have to focus, Grace.  My god.  I worry Michael uses Will.  I think he's after something.  Well, then, speak up! You know the saying.  "See something, say something."  Your hair's looking a little over-processed.  Oh, you mean as it pertains to Will. [LAUGHS]  Why isn't there a shorter way of saying that?  [SIGHS]  Hey!  More great news vis-Ã -vis Michael.  I am taking him on a cruise  to the Caribbean!  We're gonna visit Rihanna's middle school!  Isn't that exciting?  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   Coming through.  Hey, pick a number!  Oh, okay.  One.  Hi, I'm Amy. How can I make your day sweet?  I need a cake.  Well, you're in luck.  I'm a cake maker.  For now, if they don't raise my rent.  - This whole neighborhood is - Okay, honey, honey.  People like me don't care about  the problems of the white working class.  That was just to win the election.  Speaking of which,  I need a big cake  for a very important person's birthday.  Ooh, important!  - Mm-hm. I want it chocolate - Uh-huh.  With white frosting and a lot of stars.  - Uh-huh. - Red lettering.  Uh-huh.  And I need it to say,  "M-A-G-A.  Make America Great Again!"  You're making a cake for your president!  Oh.  He's coming to my house for a thing.  We're serving white Russians.  But you don't need to know the guest list.  Well, that sounds nice, but no.  [SPUTTERS INCOHERENTLY]  I'm sorry. I hate to disappoint people,  and I'm very bad at standing up for myself,  which is why Jocelyn said  I should never work in the front,  but she's dead now,  and I won't make a cake for that person.  Let me get this straight, Smiley Cyrus:  You're refusing to make me a cake  because you don't like what it says?  That's correct.  Am I crying now? I'm probably crying.  [JAZZ MUSIC]  [UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC]  And I know I already have one,  but how can you take a trip  without buying a new dopp kit  and call yourself a man?  See, look.  With a kicky polka dot pattern inside?  That's nice. If Katy Perry were a kangaroo,  I'm sure that's what it would look like  inside her pouch.  Well, I got a, uh, matching one for Michael.  Um, about Michael  can we talk about that?  Why, what is there to say about Michael?  Nothing. I didn't say anything about Michael.  Who said anything about Michael?  - You did. - Oh, that's right.  Somebody's got a good memory.  Is there something wrong?  You seem more meerkat-y than usual.  I'm actually a little dry, so I'm just gonna  Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.  It just  if you have a problem with me and Michael,  just say it.  Okay, okay.  Um  I worry you and Michael are rushing into things  and I think you should take a look at that.  No, no, not the face!  I'm not gonna hit you!  I was reaching for a thread. I'm not mad.  Oh. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]  I get it. It has been fast.  I'll I'll think about it. Thanks.  That's good.  I'm glad we had this talk.  - Tap, tap. - [LAUGHS]  [UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC]  [PHONE RINGS]  Grace Adler Design.  Oh. Hey, Mrs. Walker.  Really?  Wow, okay.  Yeah, I'll let Grace know.  Come on, you know I don't like doing this.  Black and white dress.  It's the muumuu with the GPS on the top.  What was that about?  Oh, it was Mrs. Walker.  She said she's going to be late.  She got into a thing  at the bakery on West 4th.  They wouldn't make her a cake because it  went against their beliefs.  Seriously?  It's just like that thing in Colorado  with that baker who wouldn't make the gay wedding cake.  - Well, yes and no - That is unacceptable!  I mean, we live in New York City!  - The thing is - Oh, my gosh!  No, no, no!  No! You know what?  They got Grace Adler  on the wrong day.  First, I am going down there  and I am going to rip someone a new donut hole,  and then, I am coming back  with a gay wedding cake.  She wanted them to put  "Make America Great Again" on the cake.  She's on her own.  What?  Uh, I don't know.  Eh, it's cool for a bakery  to refuse to make a MAGA cake,  but not a gay cake?  It's a totally different situation.  People on "Jezebel" have explained why  at length,  which is why I didn't read it.  It was too long.  I don't know. Look, how can you complain  about your free speech  if you're not gonna defend someone else's?  Tony, what if someone wanted to make a cake  that said "I hate Puerto Ricans"?  Well, if it says "Make America Great Again,"  the "I hate Puerto Ricans" is implied.  But if Mrs. Walker could get turned away,  anyone can get turned away.  Tony, don't paint this like I'm a hypocrite  if I don't go down there and  It's the bakery that gives out  cookie pizza samples.  Then again, it is very important  to follow your moral compass.  [UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC]  This is crazy.  When we broke up, you were a trainer,  and now you've got your own gym.  You always wanted this.  I remember my dad built me a treehouse  and I turned it into a Curves.  Well, that's just for women. How did you get in?  Yeah, he didn't like that either.  Uh, one question.  Is it about how crazy it is  that we're back together after 20 years?  That, and I can't believe we're liking green these days.  I know.  My 30s were all about  forgiving my parents  and becoming more tolerant of spring tones.  - [LAUGHS] - Will, these last two weeks  I know. It's like we never broke up.  I mean, maybe it's crazy,  but I feel like we're ready to talk about something  vis-Ã -vis us.  Sounds like a big vis-Ã -vis.  It is.  You know what?  This is this is totally the wrong place to bring it up.  We can talk about it later.  Hey, you okay?  Yeah. Oh, it's  something Jack said about us  moving too fast.  Ah.  [LAUGHS]  I feel for Jack. I really do.  How do you mean?  He doesn't want us together for the same reason  he didn't want us together the first time.  He was jealous I had a hot boyfriend  and he was living with a parrot?  No, Will,  because he's in love with you.  Don't you know that?  Jack has always been in love with you.  [JAZZ MUSIC]  There she is.  That's the woman  who violated my civil rights.  This is exciting.  I feel just like Rosie Parker.  You mean Rosa Parks.  No, Rosie Parker, my squash partner.  She's always raising a stink.  Oh, God, it's you.  We're closed. Have a sweet day!  Um, hi.  Um,  So you refused to serve my friend  because you don't believe with her beliefs,  and it's understandable,  because her beliefs are horrible,  but even people with hateful beliefs  have rights.  First they came for the filthy rich  and I said nothing.  Then they came for the moderately wealthy,  and I said nothing.  No.  Okay, please just make her awful cake.  Be strong, Amy.  Think of what Jocelyn would say  if she'd made it out of that ravine alive.  I still refuse.  Okay, look, I I totally understand,  but refusing her  is the same  as refusing marginalized people,  like an interracial couple or a gay couple.  Or a man married to a dog,  or a lamp.  Or a lamp married to a dog.  Karen?  - Karen? - Hm?  You are much more persuasive when you don't talk.  I would never turn away a marginalized person.  She's asking me to make a cake  for my second-least favorite  powerful man on Earth.  Least favorite. I keep forgetting  my dad is dead. [LAUGHS]  Excuse me. What's the holdup?  They want me to make a MAGA cake  for the president, and I said no.  Good for you.  And shame on you both.  That man has insulted and degraded Latinos.  Okay, honey, we're gonna need  a little less Cesar Chavez  and a little more Ted Cruz.  No, no, no, no, no. Not "we."  I'm on your side. I'm you.  How can you celebrate that man?  He mocks the disabled.  Okay, thanks for the wide bathrooms,  but that's enough out of you.  [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]  You're terrible people.  And we terrible people  have been shamed  for too long.  But Grace is taking a stand,  and I'm with her.  No.  Nope, she's not with me. I am not with her.  I'm with the other her.  I-I mean, I even wore a pantsuit to vote.  I cried when he won.  Me too.  My dealer moved to D.C.  Actions speak louder than words,  and your actions say that you're on his side.  Okay, I I get it from these two,  but I am not taking it from a white guy.  I'm transgender.  Did not know that.  But anyway, you're still white,  so stop coasting.  Okay,  can you please just do the right thing  [WHISPERS] which so feels like the wrong thing  [REGULAR VOLUME] and make the cake  [WHISPERS] that we both hate?  No.  Okay, come on!  And excuse my language,  but get the heck out of here!  Okay, you know that I can call the ACLU on you, right?  I mean, they'll represent anyone.  Westborough Baptists, Illinois Nazis  Fine people on both sides.  You'd actually do that?  I really don't want to  but yeah.  Fine, but you're even more of a monster than she is.  I'm not, I swear!  Honey, honey, I've told you a hundred times,  learn how to take a compliment!  [ENERGETIC JAZZ MUSIC]    So I-I talked to Michael today.  Mm-hm.  He thinks we're we're ready  to make a major commitment to each other.  What about what I said about  not rushing into things?  I know. Well, but Michael thinks  that maybe the reason you said that  is because  because you're in love with me.  I'm in love with you?  Will, I  I have a boyfriend.  Drew and I are in a loving, mature, adult relationship.  [CELL PHONE RINGS]  Drew, why are you calling me?  I said I'd call you when I get there!  Bananas, Q-tips, Go-Gurt!  The list doesn't change!  Kiss, kiss, bye!  Well, I hope you told him that was crazy.  Well  Wait a minute, you agree with  You think I'm in love with you?  It would explain a lot.  Wow.  I'm speechless. There are no words.  - Jack - Of course you believe it.  Of course you do!  Because the entire basis of our friendship is that  you think I'm just your silly, ridiculous, loser friend  who you'll always feel superior to,  and me being in love with you makes me just  the perfect combination of sad and pathetic  to keep you above me forever.  So there are some words.  You know what you know what's actually pathetic?  That you are feeling so old and alone and desperate  that you would ignore the advice from your good friend,  which, by the way, I've always been  and only want to be,  to make it work with some guy  who you just started dating again,  who I guarantee you  is using you for your money.  My my what? My money?  What? Michael doesn't want my money.  He's got his own business.  He's a user, Will!  He's always been a user.  What are you talking about?  Has he ever picked up the check at dinner?  Have you?  We are not talking about me.  Has he ever once offered to pay for  a cab, a movie, anything?  - Have you? - Again, not talking about me.  Mark my words, he is gonna ask you for money,  and when he does, I am going to be there,  and I will laugh in your face,  like this: [LAUGHS AFFECTEDLY]  No, that's not right. [LAUGHS]  No, that was terrible. [LAUGHS]  I will find it.  [ELEVATOR DINGS]  Hey.  - Hi. - You okay?  Uh, yeah. What do you  I wanted to ask you this at the gym,  but I lost my nerve.  Okay.  I know this is fast,  but we're not getting any younger,  and and sometimes life just  hands you a gift,  and and you just know that it's right.  Do you know what I mean?  I do. I really do.  You are everything I could want in a partner,  and it would make me so happy  if you would throw caution to the wind and  invest in my gym.  What do you think?  Wow.  Uh, Michael, it's that's, uh  It wouldn't have to be much at first.  Just enough to finish construction,  buy the equipment, hire a staff, you know.  Practically nothing.  Uh Can I think about it?  Of course. Of course.  - Just not too long. - [LAUGHS]  All right, I gotta go. I'm meeting the contractor.  So exciting!  Love you.  I know you heard all of that.  So come on out. Laugh in my face.  [SEDATE JAZZ MUSIC WITH MARACAS]    [JAZZ MUSIC]  Okay, here you go.  Hope this makes your day sweet.  Ha-ha! We won.  When they go low, we get high!  Honey, I want to see my MAGA cake!  Open the box!  Uh, maybe do that at home.  Can you lift up your hand, please?  Okay.  Uh, your hand is still there.  How could it be?  I cut it off for making  this horrible cake.  Here it is. One MAGA cake.  That says "I'm a gay."  How dare you come out on my cake?  Okay,  so you added an I and a Y. Very clever.  But this isn't for the vice president.  So can you please take the extra letters off?  I can't. I really can't.  I understand, so I'll do it myself.  Okay, put it down.  This bag squirts frosting, not hate.  Look, if you are not gonna do it, then I have to.  - Do not touch my art. - It's a cake.  - No, you won't! - Yes, I will!  No, you won't!  Although it may not look like it,  I have won.  [JAZZ MUSIC]  I'm sorry I said that  that you're in love with me. I know that's not true.  Thank you.  I mean, if anything,  you've always been in love with me.  Definitely not true.  You know why?  Let me get out my umbrella.  Sounds like the forecast calls for hurtful comments.  Because I knew  that you could either be  a guy I dated for a while,  or a friend for life,  but not both.  Although,  there was a moment when I thought about it.  Shut up!  You remember when we were out on the terrace  and you were about to come out to your mom?  [EXCITEDLY] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You were so vulnerable,  and and I felt so close to you,  and the look on your face  I thought,  "That's a face I could love."  Wow.  I'm glad you chose friendship.  'Cause that would've been a disaster.  Right?  What about you? There must've been  - a moment when - Nope.  - Not even - Never occurred to me.  - But in college, you - Because I felt sorry for you.  But,  let's make a pact.  If we're not with anybody  when we're old,  let's agree to meet  in the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge,  you and me,  and have somebody push us off.  - I do, Will Truman. - [LAUGHS]  Don't ask.  She acts like this is the first time  we've seen her covered in cake.  [LIGHT JAZZ MUSIC]  Thank you so much for making a new cake.  I truly, truly hate it.  Thank you. So do I.  But you were right.  It's about the principle.  On the bright side, once word got out,  business really picked up.  Hi.  Hi.  I am so sorry.  I hate to be that guy, but, uh,  can you take a look at this cake again?  The, uh, swastika's a little off-center.  Sure. I'm sorry.  It's just, sometimes, when I'm crying,  my arm isn't as steady. [LAUGHS]  Oh, is this for the birthday party?  I'll see you there.  Why are the hot ones always gay or Nazis?  [JAZZ PIANO MUSIC]  [LIGHT JAZZ MUSIC]     
                




                    			Are you gonna pour peanuts down your throat the whole way?  I think we both know the answer to that question.  I'm so excited we're doing this.  We always say that we wanna be the kind of people  that just jump in a car and go to Vermont for the weekend.  Well, now we're those people.  Yup.  Who knows where this could lead?  Ooh, we could become spring ski people.  We're gonna be fun.  Grace, that's the ex you missed the exit.  Grace, that was the exit. What are Grace?  Here's the thing. There's no Vermont.  There's no skiing. We're going to Schenectady.  Schenectady?  But that's where your family lives.  We are going there to celebrate my mom's birthday.  It was her dying wish.  I thought her dying wish was for you to get breast implants.  She had a lot of dying wishes.  So, we are going to sing happy birthday  with my emotionally distant dad and my horrible sisters  and it's gonna be awful and I need you there  to have my back and agree with everything I say.  It's your one job.  All right.  That's the way it has to be.  You're not going anywhere, Lady Bird.   - Hi, Daddy. - Shh, shh, shh.  Jordan Spieth is putting.  You can't talk while they're putting.  They can't hear us.  You see, he missed! You see what you did?  Hi, Grace. Hi, Will.  - Hey, Martin. - Hi.  Joyce and Janet here?  Yeah, they're already mad at you.  - Why? - Who knows with those two?  Come on, Will.  Will doesn't wanna deal with those yentas. Will.  Come here, watch golf with me.  It's the Phoenix Waste Management Open.  So many good choices.  It's okay, Will.  Uh-uh, that's Bobbi's chair.  Um  My dad always wanted me to watch golf with him.  Took me out a few times.  Yeah? What's your handicap?  That I hate golf.  You're funny, you know? I forgot that, you're funny.  Wanna hear a funny story?  We were on the first tee  That doesn't mean I want a monologue.  Come on, keep it moving, keep it moving.  Keep it there's nothing to see here, all right?  Just a piano pushed from a rooftop  onto a man dressed like a robot.  That is all.  Come on, keep it moving.  - Hi, lover! - Hi.  I hate to bother you while you're working but  ooh, a piano.  - Oh, Jack, no, uh - Oh, my God.  Did someone kill a robot?  It was a street performer.  Painted himself silver. When you gave him money,  he did, like, a little robot dance.  Oh, you mean like this?  Yes, yes!  He just did that.  - Hey, show some respect! - This is a crime scene!  Show some respect!  Please, this is a crime scene.  Sometimes.  Drew  I wanna talk to you about something.  God, I'm so nervous.  You know Karen, and you know how I feel about her.  - Mm-hmm. - Well,  she's having a big romantic weekend  at a hotel with her husband, Stan.  All of a sudden, it hit me.  My favorite gal in the whole world  has been with the same man for 100 years,  and it's still so exciting and romantic,  and occasionally degrading.  And I thought, that's what I want too.  I don't need to be afraid of monogamy anymore.  If she could be happy with one giant walrus  for the rest of her life,  I can be happy with my little piggy.  Drew, I love you.  Would you move in with me?  Uh  Listen, uh, Jack.  I care about you a lot.  You know that, but,  I just I'm not ready.  In fact, I was thinking that, um,  maybe we should see other people.  Other people?  What do you mean?  I just came out, you know?  You were my first.  And it was amazing, but I just, I don't know,  I think I need to get out there and experience life  as a gay guy before I settle down.  No, you don't.  If you add how many guys you've been with  and how many guys I've been with,  and divide it by two, we have both been with way,  way, way more than enough guys  to know that this is what we want.  I don't think it's what I want.  I can't believe this.  Nobody has been as crushed as I am right now.  No offense.  Well  I'm not gonna cry.  I'm not gonna  Give you the satisfaction of seeing me, uh  Why?  Anything else for you or Mr. Walker?  No, thank you, Smitty.  He'll be in the bathroom for a while.  He's using what he calls the bidet,  and we call the bathtub.  Smitty, have you always had that limp?  I didn't realize that you were handica  Oh. Ho-ho.  Uh-uh, no, no, no, no.  Almost said it.  Differently gimpy.  When I was a boy, I danced on the street for money,  and people would cheer.  So loud,  I didn't hear the street car coming.  Sheared the leg clean off.  Oh, Smitty.  How you haven't had your own Netflix special yet  is beyond me.  Okay, darling, you can come out now.  It's funny  I know your face so well and yet,  I feel as if I'm about to see it for the very first time.  I thought he'd never leave.  All right, fold your arms in.  Now, bend over.  Shouldn't you buy me dinner first?  I don't do those kind of jokes.  Okay.  He is still so hot.  And still so gay.  Well, maybe he just needs to spend time  with a desirable woman, Smudge.  Don't call me Smudge.  Why? It's better than Skidmark.  I sat on a Hershey bar.  Yeah,  right after you crapped yourself.  I did not!  Okay, look, look, can we please just  all get along tonight for one night?  Like, we're here to celebrate Mom's birthday.  That's not the only reason you're here.  We're gonna get Daddy to sell the house.  What? No, I love this house.  That's because you're not the one taking care of it,  or him. Do you know why I drink?  'Cause you're an alcoholic.  And look, I need the listing.  I've had my real estate license for a year,  and it's just, like, not going so great.  She hasn't sold one house.  She screams at the buyers.  Oh, so it's my fault that  everyone in Schenectady is an a-hole?  No, no.  Look, I don't want other people living here.  I mean, remember that time we came back from vacation  and found that drifter staying here?  That drifter was kinda hot.  Selling this house is like selling our childhood.  It is not gonna happen. I am putting my foot down.  Who cares about you and your big feet?  It's two against one,  and you're telling him tonight at dinner.  Me? Why?  Because you're the favorite.  He never says anything nice to me.  Uh, he actively says un-nice stuff to us.  He calls me Pancake,  'cause "The first one is always a mistake."  If you don't do it, remember,  we've got secrets on you.  I've got secrets on you too.  Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.  My God, I've never had a woman  - make me feel that way before. - Hmm.  And I was once the filling in a  Katarina Witt-Angela Merkel strudel.  Ah, German,  the language of love.  Ready for round zwei?  Get over here, Frau Beaverhausen.  Karen!  Karen! Let me in!  Honey, it's Jack. Quick, hide in the bathroom.  Not to worry, I always match my pajamas  to the hotel drapes for situations like this.  It's a little trick I picked up from my homey, Comey.  Malcolm,  do you really think you can camouflage yourself with  Malcolm?  - I'm right here. - Oh.  Uncanny.  Ah, you really do blend into the  Malcolm?  Karen!  Uh, coming, Jackie.  Hi, Poodle, what is it? Not a great time.  I asked Drew to move in with me,  and then he broke up with me.  Oh no, that's terrible, bye.  - No, no, no. - Ooh.  - Okay. - I can't be alone right now.  I don't know what to do.  I hid a key inside my body and he broke my heart  right as I was about to poop the question.  I'm falling apart, Karen.  There's more air outside. Why don't you go there?  No, I wanna open a window.  No!  I got a city view instead of a park view.  I'm so ashamed.  I don't care about the view.  Oh, gross, that is a city view.  Wait a minute.  Was that Yoko Ono?  Oh, it's just a beret stuck in a tree.  Hang on  What's that smell?  It's a combination of Irish whiskey, man sweat,  and American Crew high shine, high hold grooming cream.  And I'm allergic to American Crew high shine,  high hold grooming cream.  Gesundheit.  Malcolm!  I'm too polite.  Damn those nuns at Loyola.  You know, about the house  Your dad's got a lot of life left to live.  Are you sure it wouldn't be better if he just moved on?  Not only am I sure of it, but you're sure of it too,  because that's why you're here, to take my side no matter what.  I'm Khaleesi and you're one of those soldiers with no balls.  That is disturbingly accurate.  Hello, Will.  Oh, hi, Joyce.  Wow, you're tan.  Like Moana.  But thin, like Pocahontas.  I wish I could fly away like Aladdin.  Well, you've never had a friend like me.  I wonder, is this corn beef or pastrami?  Oh  What are we doing?  I'm not doing anything.  Let's start this thing, all right?  Everyone put on your party hats.  Your mother asked me to  Your mother asked me to read this on her birthday.  "Hi, everybody, I'm Bobbi Adler.  "Why is my voice coming out of an old man  "wearing that sweater I don't like?  "Because I'm dead and couldn't tell him  "to change before dinner.  "But I joke. That's what I do  "Or did.  "Thank you for coming to what would've been  my 55th birthday."  Fifty-five.  "Grace, no cracks about my age.  "Janet, stop slouching.  And Joyce, would it kill you to put on a bra?"  Oy.  "I am proud that we have always had  such a warm and loving house."  Speaking of the house,  Smudge has something to say.  Yeah, get up, Smudge, and say it.  I do have something to say.  Daddy, this is a wonderful way to celebrate Mom.  And I am looking forward to doing this every year  in this house. End of discussion.  - Back to the letter. - Okay, we warned you.  Grace slept with Vice Principal Gordon.  - Ew. - I was 22.  I played poker with that man.  He's eaten in this house.  Not just in the kitchen.  Oh, my God.  Grace smoked pot at my bat mitzvah.  Janet sold it to me.  Grace doesn't fast on Yom Kippur.  - Neither does Janet. - Neither does Joyce.  Will and I are having an affair!  No, we're not.  Janet kissed the drifter.  That drifter had a name!  And it was Jebediah.  All right, we're not gonna enough already, all right?  Everyone sit down here.  Let's go on with your dead mother's birthday.  - Sorry, Daddy. - Yes, Daddy.  - Grace started it. - Oh, my God.  Now I got floaters. I can't  Will, get up and read this.  Uh  "I am proud that we have always had  "such a warm and loving house.  "Even Vice Principal Gordon would say  "how much he loved coming here.  "Martin, you know how I feel about you,  "and, girls, I love you more than I can ever express  "in my own words.  "So instead, I'll use those of the song I sang  "at all of your birthday parties.  "You won't do it as well as me,  but, darlings, who could?"  I miss her so much.  Me too.  I'm so sorry.  Sorry? What are you talking about?  Daddy, we got into a fight.  Um  Joyce and Janet want you to sell the house,  but I don't want you to,  and and Will agrees with me.  Right, Will?  Um  Well, on, you know, on one hand,  there's Grace, and and, uh,  on the other hand, there's you.  And on the other hand, there's them.  That's three hands.  You can't have three hands.  Will, just say you agree with me.  Martin, you hate it here. You told me so.  And I don't think it would be such a bad idea  for you to get on with your life.  Get on with my life?  I have no life.  She was my life, and now you've ruined her birthday.  You had one job.  Hey, Will.  Looks like somebody could use a hug.  Come on.  Sure.  I could give you one job.  First Drew dumps me,  and now I find out you're cheating on Stan?  I'm so disillusioned.  Poodle, it's complicated.  Jack, have you ever seen the movie, "Same Time, Next Year"?  I have a VHS copy of "Same Time, Next Rear."  Well, I'm guessing they're very similar.  Every day a man wakes up and relives the exact same  sexual escapade over and over again?  No, that sounds like the plot of "Groundhog Day."  I have a copy of "Poundhog Day."  But that's about a couple who meets  on the same weekend every year for sex.  Oh wait, is that what this is?  - Jack, I can expla - Karen,  you and Stan have always been the example of true love to me.  Jackie, I do love Stan.  But marriage is complicated,  and long marriages are even more complicated.  Does Stan know about this?  No, honey, but believe me,  he reaps the benefits when I come back to him.  You don't have to explain, Karen, I  I was naive to think that  there was such a thing as happily ever after.  I think it's time I stop being so childish  and grow up.  The blue is lava, so you can't touch it.  When you get to the door,  you're safe.  We've gotta grow up too, Karen.  What we're doing is wrong.  You've got to leave Stan and be with me.  Darling, you know I can't do that.  If you love me as much as I love you, you could.  You've gotta decide me or Stan.  Take all the time you need.  Just pretend I'm not here.  Malcolm, that's ridiculous.  How can I pretend you're not here  when you're standing right ne  Malcolm?  I can't talk to you yet.  - Okay. - Get back here.  I could still yell at you.  How could you?  You totally betrayed me.  Do you know how many memories are in this house?  I mean, look where you're standing.  You're standing on the exact spot  where you told me you were gay and broke my heart.  Well, there were clues, Grace.  I mean, freshman year, I hosted  "Wednesday like Dynasty" parties.  But I'll I'll move to a less triggering spot.  Oh, and now you are right where my mom held my hair  when I threw up after the prom.  And then she got grossed out and threw up,  and I had to hold her wig.  Uh, here?  That's where she told me that I could get VD  if I let a boy go up my sweater.  How about over here?  Oh.  My gosh, I mean, that's  that's where my mother told my dad  that she was pregnant with Joyce.  And they were both so happy.  My poor dad.  Have you not I'm just thinking of him.  Are you, Grace? Or are you thinking about you?  'Cause as long as your dad is here,  you can imagine that your mom's with him  and nothing's changed.  You're so annoying.  Am I wrong?  No, that's what's annoying.  This is my one job.  He's right, Gracie.  What are we holding onto?  It's a house. It's not her.  I miss her.  We have to let her go.  Where will you live?  I'll figure it out.  So, Will, you gonna keep up with the golf?  I no, I think I I think I might.  Martin, look, today with you was  Was great and I I just, I kept thinking,  you know, my dad always wanted to watch golf with me,  and and why couldn't I just give him that?  You know? Why didn't I just say,  "Hey, come into the city and stay with me," you know?  "We'll play golf, we'll hang out."  I'll do it.  What? What?  Will's idea'll settle all our problems.  I'll move out,  I'll stay with you until I find my own place.  Oh, that wasn't my idea.  That, that  This kid is so modest.  You okay with this, Grace?  Why wouldn't I be?  My father moving in with me  it's like I'm dreaming.  Wake me up.  This is great. I'm gonna go pack.  What's the weather like there?  Eh, I'll bring a sweater.  Um, I-I didn't, I mean, I certainly wouldn't have  You know what?  One day, we are gonna look back on this  and laugh.

That's a funny word.  [CHUCKLES] It's not so funny at 2:00 in the morning  or 4:00 or 6:00 or 6:30.  Oh, Martin, I don't think I "pish" enough.  It is amazing  how your mother doesn't listen to a word you say.  I'm surprised your father hasn't gone on "Shark Tank"  to patent his signature burp-and-blow.  [BELCHES, EXHALES]  He has esophageal hysteria, you monster.  And they're not even gonna give us grandchildren.  Did we do something wrong?  - Ha! Possibly. - Yeah.  You know, I miss having someone  to complain about my children with.  - Oh, I miss it too. - [CHUCKLES]  I talk to the beagles, but they don't know.  They don't have children.  [LAUGHS] That's funny, Marilyn.  Really?

I'm musical. - Play something else!  Grace, it's not feminine to talk that loud  Or to use your arms to stand up.  You know, I don't remember you whispering at dinner,  when you were going on about Roger's butthole.  You know what, I didn't take the train into the city  with my hip and my wrist to be insulted.  Roger, Paprika,  - Dr. Silly, come. - [DOG BARKING]  If you'll excuse us  You know what?  That was not nice.  That was rude.  I'm gonna go check on your mother.  I'd like to thank you again for inviting my dad.  My pleasure.

And connection made.  - [CHUCKLES] - [PHONE DINGS]  Oh, our cookies are ready.  This guy has a sweet teeth, but we must wait to eating,  as they will be hot to the touch.  Sorry, none for you.  First class only.  [MOUTH SPUTTERS]  Well, that'll be entertaining.  He thought I was a man.  Can we talk about that?  It's late. Let's drive past it.  All right, I'll get the blankets and pillows.  I'll take the TV room, you take the couch?  Yep.  Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  Wh what did you  - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God!  Oh, my your father is having sex with my mother!  You can't get on top if you're not on board.  Oh!  And, Will, there was something else,  something that looked  wrong.  - There's a beagle on the bed. - Oh, thank God.  That's what was wagging.    Pour me another one, Smitty.  I've got the toughest decision I've ever had to make.  Have you made your choice?  Oh, darling  you make me feel so wonderful,  and I cherish every moment that we spend together.  - It's Stan, isn't it? - [SIGHS] It is.  I adore you, Malcolm.  You're the perfect vacation,  but Stan is my home  and the surrounding properties.  I can't say that I'm not hurt,  but may I kiss you good-bye?  I don't think that would be a good idea.  How about I kiss Smitty  and then you kiss Smitty,  and by the transitive property,  you and I would've shared one last kiss?  Why, what a fabulous idea.  You know, I hear that's how Mike Pence and his wife  have sex through his trainer.  What do you say, Smitty?  Well, um um  I I guess.  I'm really going to miss those  gorgeous lips of yours.  [MOANING SOFTLY]  You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  - Oh. - Thank you.  And you're the sexiest man I've ever known.  - [MUFFLED] - [MOANS]  [LIGHT PAT]  #MeToo.  Sorry, Smitty, but, uh,  buns of steel.  Titanium.  I sat on a rusty nail,  and I lost my buttocks to tetanus.  [BOTH LAUGH]  Smitty, you're divine.  [GIGGLES, SIGHS]  Karen I'm gonna miss you.  Me too.  I guess no more "same time, next year."  How 'bout same time, next lifetime?  I'd like that.    [DOOR CLOSES]  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]    - I haven't slept at all. - Me neither.  That's the worst thing I've ever seen,  and I've watched you eat lobster.  Have have you ever walked in on that before?  Oh, yeah.  My dad is so cheap that every vacation,  we would all stay in one room,  and he would say, "Are the kids asleep, Bobbi?"  We weren't asleep, Will.  - We were never asleep. - Oh  [SOBBING]  Okay, okay, here's what we have going for us:  my mother is the most repressed woman in the world;  your your father is almost clinically deaf.  So they may not even know that we saw them?  Yeah, and even if they did,  they'll they'll never bring it up.  - [BEDROOM DOOR OPENS] - Okay.  - Good morning, everybody. - Hi.  I have a big announcement to make.  My sister called,  and Aunt Honey will not lose her foot.  - Great news. - And we made love last night.  - Oh, God. - [GROANS]  First time with a Jewish man.  He was surprisingly Gentile.  - But that was his joke. - That was my joke.  Can we please not talk about this?  What? It's about time someone had  heterosexual sex in this apartment.  I've had sex with a man in this apartment.  Uh, Grace, please, I don't wanna hear that.  - [DOOR OPENS] - So  Jack, you know, we're going through  something kinda personal at the moment.  Who are these old people?  That's Will and Grace. You met them yesterday.  No, the older ones, who look like they just had sex.  Oh good for you.  No! Not good for them.  Why? It's about time somebody besides me  had sex in this apartment.  I've had sex in this apartment.  No one wants to hear that.  But let's talk about something more pleasant.  I have decided to move into the city  to be closer to Martin.  What? No, no, no, no, you love Connecticut.  It's it's where 90% of the 1% live.  We wanna see where this goes.  And and we feel we wanna be more involved in your lives,  be because, you know, clearly,  pfft, they've gone off the rails.  You know what, Marilyn, they have, they really have.  Oh, by the way, this is my boyfriend, Estefan.  - Oh! - The pleasure is mine.  It's so nice to meet a woman in this apartment  who actually looks like a woman.  - Ah, tell me about it. - Daddy!  Well, it was a compliment for my wonderful girlfriend.  - Girlfriend? This is crazy. - Love is crazy!  Love? You think you're in love  after spending one night in bed together?  We fell in love after one afternoon  of standing up together, but it's not a contest.  - But did we win? - Yes, dear.  Oh, you see, honey?  You're using them as an example?  That just proves how crazy this is.  You're rushing into things, like teenagers.  Okay, I get it. It's scary to be alone.  I mean, I lost my relationship with Leo;  he lost his relationship with Vince.  You didn't lose them. They ran away.  The point is  that if we've learned anything from moving back in together,  it's that the fear of never finding "the one"  - can lead to bad decisions. - Yeah, ex exactly.  Look, I I know you think we're a little incestuous,  with the living together and the working together,  but it works for us.  And whether or not we ever find true love,  whatever the hell that is,  I I know I will always have my best friend,  and and and and if that's all I ever have,  I'd still be a happy man.  Me too  but I'll be a happy woman.  I am a woman.  - [MOUTHS WORDS] - [MUFFLED MUMBLING]  - Does that make sense? - It does.  Marilyn, I don't wanna end up like Will and Grace.  What?  Will, I wanna ask permission to marry your mother.  [LAUGHS] You are not getting it.  Eh! I don't need it!  Marilyn, life is short, love is precious  - Mm. - So what are we waiting for?  - Sweetheart, will you marry me? - She absolutely won't.  - Yes, I will! - This is a nightmare.  No, no, you wake up from nightmares.  I don't wanna be like Will and Grace, either.  I just met them and I don't want to be like them.  Martin's right.  Love is precious, and life is short.  Jack, what are you saying?  Estefan, I love you.  I knew it the moment I met you  - Oh [GIGGLES] - Yesterday.  Oh, will you make me the happiest man in the world  and propose to me?  Oh, no, no, no.  Of course, mi amor.  "Yack"will you marry me?  What? Really? [CHUCKLES]  Oh, my God, sÃ­, sÃ­, A thousand times sÃ­!  - [LAUGHS] - Oh, my  Oh, God, it's a contagion.  Congratulations to the two of you.  Oh, and congratulations to the two of you.  Should we do a double wedding?  No.  This calls for a celebration. Where's your champagne?  Um, Will and I will go get some.  - Where? - France.  Do you realize what's going on in there right now?  All the people who know us the best  are making life choices based on the fact  that they do not want to be like us.  - [ELEVATOR DINGS] - Well, not all of them.  [GROANS] You two.  Oh, the day I've had.  Had to make a decision between my lover and my husband,  and I chose my husband  because I didn't wanna end up like the two of you.  See?  Grace, there is nothing wrong with us.  We are good.  We're not enmeshed, and we're not too close,  and our relationship is is is certainly not incestuous.  You know what I just realized?  When your parents get married,  the two of you will be brother and sister.  [CHUCKLES]  We gotta make some changes.

Don't walk away!  I'm teaching you manners, you frickin' Neanderthal!  - Will, Will, Will. - Hmm?  Twitter celebrity sighting.  The West Side Curmudgeon is here.  I love him!  He hates the things we hate and Tweets about it!  [LAUGHS] Should I go over and fan-girl out on him?  - Oh, I wouldn't. - Okay, well, we're different.  I know who you are.  Okay.  You're the West Side Curmudgeon.  It's not a secret, so you can stop talking  like a drug dealer on a kids' show.  [LAUGHS] Genius!  You're delivering!  Oh, I I read your feed every day.  I mean, we hate all the same things.  - TV and taxis and - Chatty redheads?  Yeah, the worst.  - [SIGHS] I'm Grace. - Noah.  - So, uh, what is this? - Oh, oh.  Well, I, um over here.  I am running for President  of the New York Society of Interior Designers.  And you have a ton of followers,  and I would love a shout-out.  What? No, I'm not here for the  I saw a crowd and thought there'd be appetizers.  I so get that.  I was technically a Scientologist  for, like, a minute because their welcome center  had great chicken salad.  I I was in AA for the donuts  but left because of the camaraderie.  Are we the same person?  I don't know, did you ex-wife pound on your door this morning  - looking for money? - [LAUGHS]  That's who that was! [LAUGHING]  [WEAK LAUGHTER]  Just kidding. Um, my ex is a man.  I like men. Oh, not plural.  One at a time.  And and with a reasonable amount of time  between them.  But what is reasonable, really?  Oh, chatty redhead.  Just got that.  Well, uh, see you around the neighborhood.  Do you mind if I keep a pamphlet?  Of course. Um, spoiler alert, there are a lot of pictures inside  of me making this face.  Can't wait.  - Bye, Grace. - Bye, Noah.  Hey, can you hold it hold the door!  - [LAUGHING] - How'd it go?  Oh, so good.  You know when someone has a dog who hates everyone  but it just comes right up and licks you?  It's like that, but human.  And he asked if he could keep  my pamphlet.  Maybe he wanted to keep your pamphlet  to mock you on Twitter.  He is the West Side Curmudgeon.  No, Will. We hit it off.  He took the pamphlet because my contact information  is on there and he probably wants to ask me out or  he's already mocked me on Twitter, hasn't he?  It's a picture of your pamphlet that says,  "Hi, I'm Grace Adler, and I'm running for President  of the Dumbest Thing in New York."  What?  No! Let me see!  [CHIPPER PIANO MUSIC]    Grace, is Will here?  I'll get him.  [SIGHS]  Hey, what's up?  You are not going to believe this.  I just saw my boobs  walking down Madison Avenue.  [CLEARS THROAT] That's why the little label  on the pill bottle says, "Do not mix with alcohol."  Hey, I'm serious! I was on my way to Bergdorf  and I saw a woman coming up  out of a hole in the ground.  The subway. Continue.  And I looked right at her chest and I said,  "Hey.  Haven't I seen you somewhere before?"  And she said, "I don't think so."  And I said, "I'm not talking to you.  I'm talking to yous."  And she said, "Oh, yeah.  "I just got 'em done.  They're called 'Karen Walkers.'"  Wow.  I I got a million questions and I  I don't want to ask any of them.  And then  and then she said, "Oh, oh,  "you look like you got a pair of Walkers yourself.  "Have you been to see  Doctor DiLorenzo too?"  And I said,  "How dare you insinuate  "that I would go  to an Italian doctor."  I don't know what you want from me.  You're my lawyer! Stop this guy!  I don't practice law anymore.  Potato, potata.  Start focusing on my tomatoes.  You told me that you would have my back,  and I just assumed that that would include my front, too.  Okay, okay. I'll call his office  and see if I can get him to knock off  knocking off your knockers. [CHUCKLES]  [FAKE LAUGHTER]  That is such clever wordplay, she said out of pity  as she tried to get out of the room.  Will!  I need to go with you and Karen  to that plastic surgeon's office.  - How do you even know? - I bumped into her  in the hallway and she told me the whole story,  including your attempt at clever wordplay.  Bless your heart.  And while we were waiting for a tray of brownies to cool,  I told her I'm meeting Estefan's family from Spain  in a video conference tomorrow night.  And then we found a box full of pictures  of Estefan's ex-boyfriends and they're all gorgeous!  And Karen was like, "Honey, you got a problem."  Seriously, she left one minute ago.  Will, focus! I'm in a crisis!  I can't FaceTime with this face.  Jack, you don't need plastic surgery  to have a video conference with your fiancÃ©'s family.  I am not talking new cheeks and chin!  Just shave off a couple layers.  Get a little closer to my skull.  I thought "knock off knocking off your knockers"  deserved more love. [SNIFFS]  Now I'm the guy who talks to himself.  Eh, it's okay.    Ha!  I found you, Noah Broader.  That's right. I know your last name.  And I also know that you wrote one big novel  15 years ago that I pretended to read  because the print was much smaller  than the cover suggested.  Congrats on your five second Google search.  Betty, can I get a rice pudding?  This crazy woman is paying.  Not crazy, totally sane,  light stalking, not paying.  If you're sitting here, you're paying.  And a coffee. Do you want a coffee?  It's on you.  I'm not drinking coffee with you.  That Tweet was very mean,  especially after the way you flirted with me.  Flirted? You mean when you talked  and I didn't stop you?  And you happened to mention your angry ex?  Okay, I get it. You're single.  - That's flirting. - You don't date much, do you?  - And I made you smile. - No way.  I only smile when old people and nuns fall.  I made a joke about my pose  in the pamphlet, remember?  Yeah, and my face looked like this.  Just  take down the Tweet, okay?  - Yeah, I'm not gonna do that. - Seriously?  Seriously.  Great.  Have a miserable life.  - I'm done with you. - You're going  I said I'm done!  - Front door is this way. - That's what I was trying to  Done!  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  Where have you been?  We gotta meet Karen at that doctor's office  Keep your girdle on, Doreen.  I had to pick up my numbing cream.  I'm supposed to put this on an hour before  they laser-blast my face back to 1990-sexy.  Jack, don't become one of those gay guys  that start getting everything done  - as soon as he turns 40. - "One of those guys"?  We are the only gay guys over 40  who haven't at least gotten our eyes done.  We're about to lose our membership to the gym  in William-Sonoma.  Larry hasn't gotten his eyes done.  He still looks great.  Larry absolutely did his eyes.  Joe did his eyes and neck.  Rory's done eyes, neck, ears,  nose, head, shoulders, knees and toes,  knees and toes.  You're using way too much of that.  [SCOFFS] Ooh, it tingles.  God, will you please  be careful, you're getting it on your lips.  Don't lick it off.  Would you relax?  It's fine.  [GUFFAWING LAUGHTER]  [SLURRING] That's so that's so weird!  It's like [GOOFY EXCLAMATION]  "Overuse may cause extreme facial numbness."  [SLURRING] How long does it last?  - What? - How long does it last?  Oh, "how long does it last."  Uh, four hours. Why?  [BARELY INTELLIGIBLE] I have to call Estefan  at 7:00 tonight.  What?  I have to call Estefan at 7:00 tonight.  What?  - I have to call - Oh, you have to call Estefan  at 7:00 tonight.  Well, that's 1:00 AM in Spain.  You're sure he didn't mean 7:00 his time?  'Cause that's right now.  Oh, thi.  Ah! My fingers don't work!  My fingers don't work!  "Contact with fingers and other sensitive areas  may cause an unwanted reaction."  That's good advice for your love life, too.  Will, help me! I gotta make the call!  Wait, it goes on.  "In case of contact with tongue,  eating a banana may reverse the effects."  Really?  Holy crap! I'll just eat a banana!  [SIGHS]  You thon of a bith.    [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  Seriously, it's just one Tweet.  Oh, good, you're back. You forgot to pay.  Seriously, it could really hurt my campaign.  Then you'd never get to be President  of the made-up thing.  It is not a made-up thing.  It is a society dedicated to the advancement  of design and beautification of New York.  Don't take it personally, okay?  I just think people like you are ruining the city.  Did you know there are now more cupcake shops  than porno theaters in my neighborhood?  Who wants to live in that world?  I do!  Porn is gross, and we are living  in the golden age of cupcakes.  New York doesn't need "beautification," okay?  It needs uglification.  Bring back Lincoln Plaza Cinemas and  and Little Mike's.  I found a mouse in my soda at Little Mike's once.  It hadn't finished drowning yet.  So you drink around it! It's New York!  You know what I think?  I think you are a miserable, cynical person  who finds fault with everything  because you're alone in your sad apartment on Amsterdam,  and your life didn't turn out the way you wanted it to.  It's almost as if I'm a curmudgeon  who lives on the West Side.  And you follow me because you're also angry  that life didn't turn out the way you wanted.  - My life is terrific. - Oh, really?  You wanted to be divorced and alone in your late 40s?  Hey! I am in my late-mid 40s.  And I am not alone.  I live with my gay best friend.  So you have realized your dream.  You know what? You don't know  anything about me,  and if I was better at thinking  of devastating things in the moment,  I would so destroy you right now.  But they always come to me ten minutes too late,  so I am done with you.  I know!  There really should be an exit right there.    [PHONE KEYPAD BEEPING]  [LINE RINGING]  - Hello! - [SLURRING]  Why are you wearing so much sun block inside?  No, no, wait, wait, wait! [SLURRING]  You are nervous, but they will love you  because I love you.  Oh, one tiny thing.  My father has very recently  suffered a stroke.  So, please, do not call attention to it.  Papa, Jack.  [SLURRING]  Jack, what are you doing?  [SLURRED] I can't feel my face!  - I can't feel my face. - Oh, yes,  keep mocking my poor papa, mister funny man.  You think you are some kind of a John Mulaney,  but your humor is cruel like Daniel Tosh.  No, no!  [BARELY INTELLIGIBLE] My face is numb  because I used too much prescription medicine  because I was gonna get a cosmetic procedure  so I can be as gorgeous as your other boyfriend.  Oh!  You can't feel your face because you used too much  prescription medicine because you were going to have  a cosmetic procedure so you can be as gorgeous  as my other boyfriends?  [SLURRED] I'm so sorry, Estefan.  Don't you know?  You are beautiful.  An eternal boy.  You're like Peter Pan,  but you look even better in tights.  - [SLURRING] I love you. - I love you, too.  [KISSES]  That was Dr. DiLorenzo's office.  They will no longer be using your name  for his implants.  They'll now be called "Ah-oogahs."  Mm.  - So I guess we won. - Huh.  Normally, ruining an Italian's business  would make my day.  But there are still younger women out there  wearing my best asset.  Oh, come on, Karen.  You're a gorgeous woman and as as long  as that contract you signed in blood holds up  you'll be gorgeous for eternity.  If you can't trust Satan, who can you trust?  Eh, getting older sucks.  - And we're only getting older. - Mm.  Every second, closer to death.  - [SNIFFS] - And now we're closer.  And now we're closer.  - And now - Okay, another another way  to look at it is  is right now, we're the youngest  we'll ever be, so we might as well enjoy it.  Oh, that's true, honey.  Plus, who cares if we're getting older?  We're both filthy ri  I mean, age is only a number.  You're an awful human being,  and I'll always be here for you.  I know that about you.    Okay, I thought of exactly what I want to say to you.  Is it nice? I bet it's nice.  You're a coward.  You're afraid of failure,  so you never wrote another book again.  You flirt with me but then you deny it  so you don't have to be exposed.  You lob little insults at the world  and it's all so safe.  Look, I know you think what I do is lame,  but at least I try.  I take something bad  and I try to make it better.  Without that without the possibility  for a little joy or beauty in your life  what's the point?  Nice monologue.  You must have majored in theater  when you were at NYU.  Just because I memorized it  and wrote it down on this napkin  That's toilet paper. Where did you write this?  Where I find inspiration is none of your business.  Wait, how did you know I went to NYU?  What? You told me.  No, I didn't.  - You Googled me. - [SCOFFS]  - I did not. - Oh, but you did.  Let me see your search history.  You do not want to see my search history.  Fine. Fine.  I Googled you, all right?  But that that doesn't mean it's not because that  listen.  - I had no this - [MOCKING CHATTER]  - [STAMMERING] - [MOCKING CHATTER]  Wow.  Do you need to storm out  and gather your thoughts?  The exit's that way.  Huh.  "Huh" what?  Just "huh."  I'll take down the Tweet.  Thank you.  You want a rice pudding?  Sure.  Might be a while. The service is terrible.  I'm not in a hurry.

I'm traumatized.  Couldn't they wait for one of us to die?  Anything else, Mrs. Walker?  Just the check, Smitty.  And I'll take this in a doggy bag.  Mm-hmm.  Oh! Uh, Smitty  I was right to break it off  with Malcolm, wasn't I?  I mean, I should be with my husband, right?  Either way, you're lucky to have someone.  You know my wife Luanne?  I bought her a ticket on the "Hindenburg."  She and 35 others  went up in a ball of fire.  Oh, the hilarity!  Oh, Smitty! How do you always manage  to keep it fresh and edgy?  [CHUCKLING]  Oh, but you know what? You're right, Smitty.  As long as I am Mrs. Stanley Evelyn Walker,  there is no other man for me.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   And that is where the idea to run came from.  You know, there are so many issues we,  as a nation, are facing right now  healthcare, immigration  Bees.  The bees are dying.  No one knows why.  Well, pesticides and climate change.  No one knows.  I just felt that it was time to stop complaining  and get involved!  So I decided to run for mayor.  But you're not running for mayor.  Well, I realized I was not qualified.  So, I'm running for president.  Of the New York Society of Interior Designers.  Which is as important as it sounds.  [PHONE RINGING]  Grace Adler Design.  Oh, of course.

I don't care.  [PHONE RINGING]  Okay! Next time I see you people,  we're gonna be jumping right into  corporate compliance and forensic accounting.  - [CLASS GROANING] - I know, I'm excited too.  Hello, this is Will Truman, teacher.  Yes, detective, sure.  I'll be right there.  Hey! I just got a call.  - The detective? - Yeah.  - She called me too! - You know what it's about?  No. But remember that time  we stopped in Rite Aid to get dental floss sticks  and there was that big bowl of Lindt chocolates  and I took one and you said, "Those aren't free,"  and I said, "Of course they are"?  Will, I think you were right. They weren't free.  You know what the most unbelievable part  of that story is? You buying dental floss.  A police detective called me.  [WHISPERS] On my phone.  We know, she called us too, Jack.  Do you think she's investigating your beard?  Because it's suspiciously dark.  - Yeah, what's with that? - Good genes!  - It's good genes. - [KNOCKING AT DOOR]  Detective?

Where could she be?  As we round the corner, we come into Courtyard Square.  This set has been used in multiple films and TV shows,  the most famous being "Back to the Future,"  starring Michael J.

Friday? - Yeah.  You know what? She came to my class.  - [POUNDING ON DOOR] - Wilma, you in there?  Nothing!  Honey, I need to talk to you.  The secret is out.  Everybody knows I'm dyeing my beard?  What are you talking about?  Nobody thinks that Grace is a natural red-head.  I'm talking about Stan.  What about Stan?  I think someone tipped him off  about my affair with Malcolm.  I'm scared.  What? Stan would never hurt you.  He's a big softy literally, he's like memory foam.  I couldn't hug that man without leaving a boob print.  Well, if you talk to him, let me know.  Oh! Honey, do you mind?  There's a scratch on my purse  that's been driving me crazy.  Thank you.  She was in the office with me that morning.  Did you notice anything strange?  She was in the office with me that morning.  [WHISPERS] Grace!  Someone's following me.  I wish someone would follow me.  My campaign hasn't gotten a single Twitter follower yet.  Grace, you're not listening.  Stan found out about the affair,  - and he sent someone after me. - [ELECTRONIC CHIME]  Oh, my God! Mitchell Michael Mitchell,  of Mitchell Michael Mitchell Designs is following me!  And he's tweeting his full support for president!  I could actually win this thing.  Grace, I'm scared.  You're scared?  I'm about to be the voice of leadership  for a 160 mostly gay interior designers.  I wear one winter coat in the fall, and I'm dead.  And then I ran into her that afternoon.  BOTH:  She'll be coming around the mountain   -  When she comes  - Switch!  She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes   Switch!  She'll be coming around   The mountain, she'll be coming around the mountain   She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes   [CHORTLES]  Turn.  This is so nice  showering together.  You know, we can do this every day now,  for the rest of our lives.  Just you and me. No one else.  Forever  and ever.  Water I need some water!  What happened? What's wrong, mÃ­ corazon?  Nothing, nothing, nothing!  Okay, it's just that every time we talk  about being together forever,  you seem to get very thirsty.  First of all, I do not.  And I have no problem with the concept  of forever, okay?  Jackie, I need to talk!  Karen, I'm in a relationship.  You can't just walk in when I'm showering.  [LAUGHTER]  This is [MURMURS]  How funny would it be if I was that person?  Karen, would you like to join us?  - I can scowch over. - Come on in!  I'd love to, homos, but no time.  Poodle, I have to disappear.  You may never see me again, so  would you feed my hamsters  To my snake?  Sure Karen, yeah, but where are you going?  What's going on?  No time. Gotta run.  Good-bye.  [THUD]  I hope you two are happy together.  Just the two of you, nobody else.  Marriage. [CHUCKLES]  Forever.  She was asking us for help.  When said she was gonna disappear, I thought  she meant she was going to Brazil to get her 2019 face.  [GASPS] Oh, my God.  I fed her snake to her hamster.  But what if it was Malcolm?  I mean, he was in love with her, he's CIA.  He could be motor-boating her right now.  You mean waterboarding?  Do I?  I'ma text him and ask him.  Jack, if he did something to her,  he's not gonna just tell you.  Hey, Malcolm, can we talk?  What's on your mind, Jack?  I didn't even send the text yet.  I get your texts even before you send them.  A little gift from my friends at Cambridge Analytica.  And Will that guy at the gym is not into you.  Karen is missing.  Do you know where she is?  No, but if I had to guess, she's either at  Sherwin-Williams or on the run  because Stan found out we're having an affair.  We don't know that for sure.  - We do. - How?  - Because I told him. - It was you!  You know that I've worked for Stan  off and on for many years.  He suspected that someone was  sleeping with his wife, so he offered me  a good deal of money to find out who.  But it was you.  Easiest 5 large I've ever made,  except of course, for betting on the last election.  You don't think he's gonna hurt her, do you?  - No. - Oh, thank God.  But you don't understand.  Because you framed the question in the negative,  I was forced to use a negative  to assert the affirmative.  I don't don't think he's going to hurt her.  What?  I think she's in big trouble.  Malcolm! Your affair with Karen was over.  You should have stayed away! Why did you come back?  Why? That's like asking "Why is the sky blue?  Why is the grass green?, Why is your beard so dark?"  Good genes!  I came back because I'm in love with her.  I knew I'd have no shot while she was  still with Stan ruining her marriage  was the only card I had left to play.  Now I fear I'll never hear that sweet voice again.  You son of a bitch!  Darling!  Was that anger or foreplay?  How could you tell my husband  we were having an affair?  How did you find out? Who ratted?  No one. I figured it out myself.  Well me and Linda.  I honestly thought Stan wouldn't find out about it.  I guess I was just fooling myself,  thinking I was somehow immune.  Pretty stupid, huh, Linda?  Oh, we've all had our share of humdingers.  Me included. One time, I took a drink  that said, "Lisa" on it from my coffee place.  I know my name's not Lisa.  You are a bad girl.  But I just wish I knew how Stan found out.  I mean, who would have told him?  Well, I watch a lot of TV, and usually  the one who did it is the ex-lover.  The ex-lover.  Well, that would mean  Stop the tram!  [BRAKES SCREECH]  Thanks, Linda! You're a lifesaver.  I'm also slowly poisoning my father-in-law.  Respect.  I want you out of my life.  I see.  Well, what can I say?  I gambled on love and wound up passed out  on a video poker game with a roll of nickels  and two unused tickets to Jeff Dunham.  C'est I'amour. Au revoir, Karen.  - Some froyo some - No!  I have to get out of town before Stan's goon finds me.  Good-bye, dear friends.  I'll really miss two of you.  And not the two you would think.  Ha.  - Hello, Mrs. Walker. - You!  You're the one who has been following me!  - The cop? - Oh, I'm no cop!  Why did you stop talking?  I thought there might be gasps.  Because I'm not a cop. I'm a process server.  And Mrs. Walker, these are your divorce papers.  [ALL GASP]  Oh! There's the gasp.  Divorce papers.  Come on, Karen.  We're gonna get you through this.  Yeah, now that Estefan and I are taking a break,  I can be completely focused on helping you.  You two split up?  Yeah, there were issues  with the whole "forever" thing.  I'm more of a "Jack-of- all-gays", so  You can't go into a marriage thinking about forever.  Who put that stupid idea into your head?  Marriage is a series of moments.  Waking up in the morning,  smiling at each other across the kitchen table.  Hiding jewelry together and blaming the maid.  Then firing her and watching her cry  as she loads her one tattered suitcase  into the back of a cab.  You know, couple stuff.  Do you love Estefan?  Well, yeah, of course I do.  Well then, you go get him.  Even sitting here with this,  I wouldn't trade one moment with Stan.  Well, we're gonna hook up later tonight,  so I'll tell him after, but  what are you gonna do, Kar?  Whatever it is, we are your friends,  and we'll be here for you.  It's scary not knowing what's coming next,  for all of us, but, uh, you've got  the world's best safety net.  - Come here, you guys. - Aw!  I'll shave it! I'll shave it!     
                




                    			1 "Will & Grace" is recorded  in front of a live studio audience.  Oh, thank God! I'm starving.  Starving? I thought you  and the Curmudgeon were out to dinner.  I thought we were going to finally have sex,  so I didn't want to come at him all bloated and gross.  Of course not. Save it for me.  I can't believe you guys still haven't had sex.  It's been weeks. Aren't you worried  the window's going to close?  Of course I am. I like him so much.  But you know I only sleep with guys  right away who I don't like.  That'll show them.  Oh, look, it's a double feature.  "Rio Homo" and "High by Noon."  Hey, we're going to Texas!  Karen's flying us down to see my grandson Skip.  He's singing in a church concert tomorrow,  and Elliot's out of town, so I'm going to go support him.  And I was already flying down there  to see the section of the wall that I sponsored.  That border wall is un-American.  Only on one side. Our side is un-Mexican.  [MOUTHING WORDS]  Oh, Will, come with me. Skip would love to see you,  and Texas would be so fun.  All the colorful sheriffs and the busty madams.  That's "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas."  Well, we'll find out, won't we?  You should go, Will. You know, to be there for Skip,  and to do something nice for your friend.  You just want the apartment to yourself  so you can finally sleep with Noah.  - Yeah, I'm the friend. - I guess I could go.  I did buy those new suede cowboy boots  to see "A Star is Born" opening night.  I I think I got all the tear stains out.  You haven't had sex with him yet?  What, are you having it renovated?  Rip up the carpet, paint the walls,  and let him move in.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   [KNOCKING AT DOOR]  It's Noah!  Uh  - Noah, it's not a great time. - Grace, open up.  It's an emergency.  What's the matter? Are you okay?  We need to have sex. I think the window is closing.  I know, right?  I meant to bring it up at dinner,  but I got distracted by that stupid waitress.  "Hi, my name's Paisley."  Who names their child after an old lady's scarf?  Yesterday, I had an Uber driver named Jonald.  Two stars for your dumb name.  You may be the perfect woman.  I think so too.  Okay, that's enough foreplay. Let's do this.  So uh, what are we thinking? Here or the bedroom?  Is the balcony crazy?  Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.  - What, what's wrong? - Look at me.  Oh, okay.  Is this better? You like this?  Um, no, no. No I mean, yes.  But, no, I just I just ate too much.  I feel I feel gross.  I don't think you're gross. So, problem solved.  You've never felt too gross for sex?  Never, not once.  Not even the day I got hit by a cab.  If the woman's on board, the train leaves the station.  Well, women just aren't wired like that.  - It's biology. - No, you're just being neurotic.  I'm not  You know what? Fine.  No, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?  - We're having sex. - No, no, we're not.  Not not if you don't feel like it.  No, but you talked me into it.  No, no, no, no, no. No.  No, nobody's talking anybody into sex.  Not in 2018.  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]    Wow.  You know, being in Texas reminds me  of watching "Dallas" as a kid,  and wanting shoulder pads like Victoria Principal.  And using Maxi-Pads to do it.  You know, like like most boys my age.  Keep your voice down, Mary Ellen.  What is wrong with you?  You've been acting strange since we landed.  I didn't know the real Texas would be so  Texas-y, you know?  I feel a suffocating cloud of homophobia following us.  That may be the Midnight Fantasy by Britney Spears  that you're wearing.  Does this place seem homo-friendly to you?  A guy outside looked at me and spit on the ground.  He's chewing tobacco.  You're not supposed to swallow it.  See? Homophobic!  Grandpa Jack! Will!  - Hey! - Oh, my God, Skip!  Good to see you, buddy. Come here.  Oh, my God. Hey, come sit.  My mom's outside. I just wanted to say hi.  I'm so glad you're going to see me sing for the first time.  I wouldn't miss it for the world.  I'm so proud of you.  You know, a lot of people are scared  to share their talents with the world.  And some people aren't scared enough to share theirs.  - Good one. - Not really.  You're young. Your sense of humor is still developing.  Hey, let's take a selfie!  My new Pixel has a wide-angle lens  so we can get most of Will in it.  [LAUGHS] See, that's funny and smart.  [SHUTTER SNAPS]  - There. - So, uh, Skip.  What church song are you going to sing?  It's not that kind of concert.  It's a talent show, and the song I'm doing is a secret.  But you're going to love it.  Who am I kidding? I have to tell you.  I'm doing "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"!  - That's great. - That's so great.  [WHISPERING] Oh, my God!  - That's a great song. - To sing in Texas!  [WHISPERING] No, it's not.  It's so exciting. Say, tell me.  Is there an exit from the backstage area  to the street in case of an emergency?  - I don't know, why? - No reason.  So exciting! [LAUGHS]  [MOUTHING WORDS]  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  [BIRD CAWS]  I've got an incoming civilian.  Looks like a rich white lady. Will engage and report back.  Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  Howdy, officer. Sorry I'm late,  but I decided to go over  the bumpiest parts of the road twice.  Let's just say this cowgirl  was coming 'round the mountain when she came.  - Can I help you, ma'am? - I'm Karen Walker.  This is my portion of the wall. Pretty, isn't it?  I love how it lets them see what they can't have.  I'm afraid this isn't your section of the wall.  - Someone else sponsored it. - That's impossible.  I specifically requested this section  because this is where the most illegal drugs get seized.  I appreciate you trying to help  keep drugs out of America  Who says I'm trying to keep them out?  This is an outrage.  Who would have the giant cojones  to steal my sponsorship of the wall?  Well, well, well.  Hello, Karen.  I thought "Walker, Texas Ranger"  got canceled years ago because of old age.  Oh, and I nearly forgot  to congratulate you on "Toy Story 4."  I heard Stan kicked you out of the manse  like a dried-up old tumbleweed.  I never thought you would have blown all the way down here.  Or are you just visiting my section of the wall?  It's my section, Wyatt Twerp.  Now get these Hot Wheels out of here  before I move them out for you.  - I'd like to see you try. - Hold on tight, Beverley.  Because you're about to try reverse cowboy.  [BOTH GRUNT]  Take that, you Mexican jumping queen!  [CRASHING]    [KNOCK AT DOOR]  - Hello. - Well, hello.  - You look great. - And I feel like I look great.  Then nothing's stopping the train  from leaving the station.  All aboard who's coming aboard.  I'm going to need to see you papers.  Wait, I just took it to a weird Nazi place.  All right, let's do this.  [BOTH LAUGH]  - Oh, oh, by the way. - Uh-huh.  - A little something for later. - Okay.  Oh, my God! You went to City Sandwich!  - Yeah, I did good, huh? - Oh, so good.  - Oh, God, I miss that place. - What do you mean?  - It didn't go anywhere. - Oh, well, it's kind of funny.  I slept with a guy who works there,  and he got kind of kind of clingy.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You slept with a guy who works there?  Yeah, he made such good sandwiches,  I thought I was into him,  but it was definitely just the sandwich.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. The  The guy who makes the sandwiches?  With the beard? You mean Brian?  You know Brian?  Yeah.  Of course I know Brian!  Brian's my guy!  Well, I guess he was kind of my guy too.  That's not funny.  I can't believe you're this jealous.  No, no, no. I'm not jealous, okay?  It's just that you slept with someone I know  who just touched my meat.  What are we even talking about?  I don't know.  So we're not we're not  What do you think?  [SIGHS]  [SNIFFS]  Delicious. Brian wins again.  Skip can't sing a song that gay in a Texas church.  He'll be scarred for life. Figuratively, and maybe even  What's the other one? I can't remember.  - You mean "literally"? - Yes, well, I literally  can't remember the opposite of "figuratively."  - What am I going to do? - What are you talking about?  You're the one who rescued him from that conversion camp  and gave him the courage to be who he is.  In New York. Not in Texas.  They beat up gay kids for sport here.  Haven't you ever seen "Friday Night Lights"?  Yes, but I'm pretty sure you haven't.  Learning how not to be a target  is just as much a part of being gay as learning how to do this.  See what you made me do?  You know I always high kick when I'm emotional.  Jack, have you ever wondered  why I'm not a world-famous rock star?  Can't sing, can't dance, cankles?  It was the fall of 1980, and a young Will Truman  was crying into his Perry Ellis sheets  because his mother wouldn't let him do the talent contest  dressed as Freddie Mercury from Queen.  She said it was my own fault if I got beat up.  And when I signed up anyway,  she hid my moustache and fake teeth.  Wow.  I see why you never told me that story.  Yeah, painful.  It's long.  Learn to edit, Will.  Jack, this is my origin story.  Me, alone, singing "Bohemian Rhapsody"  to my GI Joes, who met while on leave and fell in love.  Do you know how that felt?  Trying to be a queen,  and not being supported by someone I love?  It left a mark that I've never completely gotten over.  - He'll get bullied. - Maybe.  And that would be horrible.  But he needs to live his truth, and you need to support him.  That all makes sense in America.  But this is Texas!    [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  This is preposterous!  What am I even being charged with?  Fleeing the scene of a child's birthday cake.  And stealing my wall.  Mr. Leslie, can you come with me?  I will.  There's no need for excessive force.  Unless that's what you're into.  This place is pretty miserable.  Unless  I'm sorry, is this your house?  - No, I'm locked up, like you. - Ah, what are you in for?  I tried to climb your precious wall.  Oh, well, maybe you should do what other immigrants do  to try to get in legally, like,  I don't know, be white, or look white, or  marry the president.  Besides, is Mexico so bad?  I snuck across the southern border  fleeing the brutal gangs of my home.  I have travelled 2,000 miles and spent my life savings  paying off the cops and hiding from the cartels.  For me, Mexico has been hell.  Well.  The beaches are nice,  but it sounds like you've been mostly inland.  Why am I even talking to you?  I bet you couldn't even find El Salvador on a map.  El Salvador?  I knew someone from El Salvador.  Her name was Rosario. Did you know her?  We had a burro named Rosario.  Loud, and stubborn, and kicked you when you got too close.  That's her!    [KNOCKING AT DOOR]  All right, I walked around the block,  and I saw a millennial protesting straws  get crapped on by a pigeon,  and I didn't even crack a smile.  - Why are you telling me this? - Because that sort of thing  usually cheers me up.  Are we too crazy for each other?  - Well, you are a lot of work. - You're no picnic, either.  What? Eh, who am I kidding?  [SIGHS]  You know what, maybe it's good that the window closed.  Yeah.  Maybe we dodged a bullet.  - It's a shame, really. - How so?  I bet the sex with us would have been amazing.  Definitely, I mean,  crazy on crazy can get pretty crazy.  In my '20s, I'd just phone it in.  Now I got something to prove.  My constant fear of death has infused my lovemaking  with a sense of panic that's really upped my game.  At this point,  there's basically nothing I won't do.  Mm.  - It's too bad. - Yeah, too bad.  Hey, when you say there's basically nothing  you won't do, you you mean  Everything.  I'm tired. I'm going to bed.  You can let yourself out.  Oh, my God. What is taking you so long?  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  You know, up until this point,  I hadn't heard one bad thing about the wall,  and I watch Fox News all the time.  I've heard a lot about the War on Christmas, but  Well, they've never trashed the wall.  Gosh.  What if it had kept my Rosario out?  She came to America, just like you want to.  And all her dreams came true.  What did she do?  She cleaned my toilets,  and made sure I didn't choke on my own sick while I slept.  My dreams are a little different.  Really? How so?  My husband came here four years ago with my daughter.  I just want to be with them again.  Hmm.  Here, honey. Take this.  I bought it for myself when Rosario died.  It's worth a stupid amount of money.  Sell it, and maybe you can get yourself out of here  and find your family.  [DOOR BUZZES]  Mrs. Walker, you're free to go.  Thank you.  You seem like a person with many horrible qualities.  Who can occasionally be redeemed  through unexpected kindness.  Good read.  Oh, Karen,  the things he made me do to him to let us go.  He may look like Mr. Clean, but he's Mr. Dirty.  Anyway, he said that all we had to do  was split the cost of repairing  the gap that we made in the wall.  Well, you're on your own.  I'm not sponsoring that thing anymore.  What? Do I look like the kind of man  that would pay an exorbitant amount of money  just to have a hole filled?  Oh, Beverley Leslie.  Sometimes, you make it too easy.    Hi, is this where the talent show is?  You are in the right place. The last boy is singing now.  The "sensitive" one with the fancy haircut.  - Will, start the car. - Yeah, we we took a Lyft.  - And I cannot let you - Start the Lyft!  Diamonds!   But diamonds     Are a girl's best     Best friend   [APPLAUSE]  Oh, my God! They're all slapping him!  You don't recognize that sound  because it's applause.  Jack? Open your eyes.  - They love him. - They do?  - They do. - They do!  That's my grandson! He's related to me!  I dreamed of being in a talent show once.  I fantasized about playing my idol, Freddie Mercury,  but my mother had other ideas.  This sounds like a long story.  Yeah, but I I made some edits.  Great job, Skip.  I want to thank my Grandpa Jack  for teaching me to always be true to myself, no matter what.  Sounds like he's a great role model.  No, I'm not, I  but now's not the time to make some dramatic confession.  I am the worst role model in the world!  May I?  - Oh, I'd really rather - Thank you so much.  Skip, I've been a terrible grandpa.  I came here to actually stop you from performing.  Well, why would you want to stop me?  Because I I thought they wouldn't accept you as you are.  I just assumed they'd be homophobic,  but it turns out I was Texa-phobic.  Intolerance comes in many forms.  I'm having a private conversation  with my grandson here.  Thank you.  Then why are you still on the mic?  Because it's a teachable moment, pastor!  Thank you, go in peace.  Skip, it's it's important to see people for who they are,  not for who you expect them to be.  A powerful notion everyone heard  because I'm on the mic!  Please, don't let anyone ever talk you out of being you.  - Even if it's you? - Even if it's me.  Although, Marilyn did have cleaner lines  and a stronger turnout.  But we got time for that.  And I just want to say to my friend, Will,  that I should have listened to him,  and that I wish he had the chance  to let out his inner "Queen."  Ay-oh!   Ay-oh   Ay-oh!   Grandpa Jack?  Can something be too gay?  Yes, it can, Skip.     
                




                    			1 Will & Grace is recorded  in front of a live studio audience.  - Morning. - Morning.  Do you like the new Grace Adler?  I'm putting her in the lobby of the design union  to remind people to vote.  Isn't that just an invitation  for someone to draw a penis on it?  Why do you diminish my efforts?  Why do you diminish your thighs?  Whose did you use? RuPaul?  Grace, did you eat all of the almond butter?  I just bought it.  This really throws me off; I had already calculated it  into my good fats for the day.  What, am I supposed to eat a coconut like a castaway?  I don't know what to say.  How about, "I'm sorry."  Okay, okay.  - Well? - What?  Aren't you going to say, I'm sorry?  Oh, my God. How many times do I have to apologize?  How about once?  Will, can we just agree that almond butter is stupid?  Because no matter what you tell yourself,  it's not peanut butter and it never will be.  Sorry I brought it up.  Apology accepted.  Hey, so, you know how I've always been kind of psychic?  Like a little queer-voyant?  - [TOGETHER] No. - See?  I knew you were going to say that.  So, after taking a short online course  and proving that I'm not a robot,  the good folks at The United Community of Psychic People,  or UCPP, have welcomed  [LAUGHING]  Oh, my God.  UCPP!  I just got that.  Do you guys get it?  - Mhm. - Yeah.  Anyway, those guys have welcomed me  into their community of a certified psychic.  There's no name written on there.  Yeah, it costs $500 for them to put that on there.  So, can I borrow  ALL: No.  Now, I'm scaring myself.  And, if you need a further demonstration,  Karen is gonna walk through that door in 5  Now, honey?  [QUICKLY] 4,3,2,1.  Grace, I need a favor.  Over here.  Oh, right. The campaign.  But the resemblance is uncanny.  But aren't you worried  someone's gonna draw a penis on it?  No! Why does everybody Jack!  Honey  Is it okay if I store  a few things from my place at the office?  Um  I've decided to sell the manse.  - Really? - I saw it in a vision.  Now that Rosario is gone and with the divorce  there's just too many memories.  One of my favorite memories is the time you and Stan were  being robbed and you wouldn't let Rosario in the panic room  because it wasn't, in your words, a "His-panic room."  I like to make life nice for the working classes.  Right, middle class grace?  I'm sorry. Right, middle class Grace?  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   [GASPS] Would you look at that?  It's the bracelet Stan gave me  for eating one of my mini Prada bags.  He thought it was a taco.  Karen, I'm getting so many vibrations from being around  all your old stuff.  Like this. Wow.  Hey, now that I'm a psychic, could I rock a turban?  Honey, I'm really looking forward to watching you  con poor people out of their money.  "Should I buy food or should I listen  to what this dum-dum in a turban has to say?"  Karen, I have a real gift.  The only gift you have is the one  where you clean yourself like a dog.  It's the gift that keeps on giving,  And receiving.  But Karen, I am telling you, I am truly psychically connected.  Honey, I come from con man stock.  My mother was a grifter.  My father was a flim-flam man,  when he wasn't governor of Oklahoma.  The only thing a fake psychic needs  is to find out what their mark wants to hear  and then give it to them.  Okay, okay, I'm sensing skepticism.  Karen inspired me to finally clean out the closet.  Plus, it's raining so I couldn't go running.  You never go running.  I wasn't going to start in the rain.  You are not going to believe what I found.  Oh, Grace, you broke Garfield off his base.  Now it just says, "I love lasagna," with no context.  Because it makes a lot more sense when a cat says it.  Can't you just say, "I'm sorry?"  Okay, fine.  You actually have to say it.  Oh, my God, you're relentless.  I found all the letters that we wrote to each other in college.  Oh, yeah. You know, I actually  I meant to organize those for the archives.  For when I was going to write my memoir.  Oh, right, right, and it had that weird title.  Weird tit  "Homo with a Pie" is a great title,  and when I get around to writing it  it's really gonna delve into the complexities  of the gay experience in America,  and at the end there'll be recipes.  - You know, for for pie. - [LAUGHS]  Okay, check this out. Spring break freshman year.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God I was so in love with you.  Remember I was desperately trying to get you  to have sex with me?  Yeah, I was desperately trying to avoid it.  - Read the letter. - Okay.  "Hey, lover, I hate that our schedules keep conflicting.  "Will, there's something I don't want anymore  "and I want you to take from me.  "Wink wink. Read the back.  I'm talking about my virginity."  Oh, no.  Oh, I just want to reach back in time  and slap the dumb out of me.  Hey, you think you're bummed, I'm a guy.  "While I was giving possibly my best performance of  "'Trouble in River City, ' the whole time I was thinking  "'I wish I was in bed making love to Grace, '  "with a capital G that rhymes with C  "and that stands for 'coitus.'  [LAUGHS]  [PIANO MUSIC]  Your Fur- Oooh, perfume. Your Style, Yo- Oh.y.  This seems very special indeed.  I'm gonna have to do a spray and step.  Spray, delay, and walk away.  You know, Rosario gave me that perfume  because she thought that it would bring  true love into my life.  Her exact words were, "This will cover up the stink  "of the alcohol and then maybe  you can trick a man into tolerating you."  Ah.  She was such a romantic.  And then, sure enough,  the very first time I wore it,  I met Stan.  You can toss it.  I'm never falling in love again.  What? Why would you say that?  Because I'm through with love.  I mean, sure, I'll have my needs met.  The occasional rub and tug.  The all night bang fest.  A back alley bean twiddle.  But as far as my heart goes  it is closed.  Well, I hate hearing that Karen.  You have so much love to give.  - All you need to do is just - Ba-ba-ba-ba-boo.  Go back to your fake magic tricks.  It's not fake, Karen!  I can see your future.  I see romance, I see travel  I see London.  I see France  I see Karen's underpants.

I see happiness.  Oh, save it for your next mark.  Wait, wait.  [THUNDER RUMBLES]  I'm fee  I'm feeling something strange, Karen.  What?  Oh, it's coming from in here.  [GASPING]  It's Rosario's jacket.  Ooh.  Check the pocket for scratchers.  [THUNDER RUMBLES]  [GASPS]  [AS ROSARIO] Hello, lady.  [GASPS]  [BOTH BREATHING ERRATICALLY]  Oh  - Ah. - Choo.  What just happened?  I don't know.  But honey, I think you might have another gift  besides squeaky clean balls.  Uh oh.  November 29th, 1985.  The day after Thanksgiving.  When I came out to you.  Ugh, you ripped my heart out.  It was like everything I believed in was a lie.  Even holding this in my hand I feel like I wanna throw up.  Should we read it?  [THUNDERING]  That's a good sign, right?  I can't totally explain it, Karen, but it's like  Rosario's all around me.  She's in me  and then she's out of me.  She's in me and then she's out of me.  It's like our wedding night all over again.  Is she happy? Does she like cleaning heaven?  She says it's bigger than she thought  Oh.  But they do let her take home  leftover chicken and the recyclables.  Does she have a message for me?  - She does. - [QUIETLY] She does.  Oh, this is interesting.  Rosario says you're going to find love again.  That's crap.  What did she break into god's liquor cabinet?  Um, this is coming from a disembodied ghost  so, kinda think it's real. [LAUGHS WRYLY]  She doesn't know what she's talking about.  [GASPS] Uh-oh.  She did not like that.  Why, what'd she say?  Rosario, I'm not going to tell her that.  Well just tell me.  She says you're gonna get mad.  I'm not gonna get mad.  - She says you're a quitter - Mm-hmm.  She says you should put on that perfume  and get your rich, pampered ass back out there.  She is not allowed to talk to me that way!  Even though she is dead, she's fired.  [GRUNTS]  [YELPS] What are you doing?  - She's coming through! - [YELPS]  - She's taking over. - Oh!  [GRUNTS] I'm losing myself!  [STRAINS]  [GASPS]  [AS ROSARIO] Well, there are a few things  I'd like to say to you, too.  If you quit on love, you're a fool.  - What the hell do you know - Listen, lady  [TALKING OVER EACH OTHER]  Sapphire earrings of mine that you stole  and then swallowed and passed through your digestive track  and you thought I wouldn't notice.  Why do you think I have butler stand outside the door  with a pair of rubber gloves on bathroom day.  Lid for every pot and that means there's someone for you.  Rosie.  Do you really think so?  I do.  Then I won't give up on love.  I love you, Mami.  I love you too, Mami.  I miss those lips.  - She's going. - Oh, no.  - She's going. - [GASPS]  [BOTH BREATHING ERRATICALLY]  She's gone.  Oh, no. Rosie, wait.  Rosie!  [PIANO MUSIC]  Okay, let's set the scene.  It's the day after I came out to you.  I'm back at school wearing a Clinique peel-off mask  because of a stress pimple,  and listening to our song over and over.  How could I not see it?  - Our song was Dancing Queen. - Mm.  [EXHALES SHARPLY]  This is a short one.  "Grace, I'm so sorry.  I'm just so sorry."  - So sad. - I know.  And then I wrote you that big long one.  Oof, huh?  Yeah, I couldn't even open it.  You di  You didn't read it?  - No, I couldn't. - Really?  'Cause if I had gotten a letter this thick  scented in white diamonds, I'd have been a little curious.  Will, I was devastated.  I mean, I even considered being a lesbian  but women are a lot of work. [GRUNTS]  I can't believe you're joking.  I cried when I wrote this letter.  You cried? I think we know who was crying.  But come on, we're good. We got through it.  You apologized.  Yeah.  Over and over again.  What does that mean?  We never talk about this  but that's kind of our dynamic, isn't it?  That I always say I'm sorry. You never say it.  It's like I'm constantly apologizing  for the original sin of hurting you.  - Okay, I - No, that's true. That's true.  And you never have to apologize because you're the victim.  Oh, my God.  Is this about your almond thing?  I said I'm sorry.  No, you didn't.  You never do.  Why are you getting so mad  about something that happened a million years ago?  'Cause you didn't read my letter.  You didn't even think that maybe  I was going through something, too.  Maybe I needed my best friend.  Okay, fine. I'll read it.  Give it to me.  No.  What do you mean, "no."  You had your chance.  No, no, no, no. You're not going out there.  - Aren't I? - Nope.  It is pouring rain and you are wearing  your suede driving moccasins.  I don't care.  Okay, yes, I care. I care.  You did not just do that.  Oh, didn't I?  The one time he doesn't throw like a girl.  Mrs. Timmer?  Oh, there you are.  I like your hat.  It's a Duane Reade bag.  Just take the compliment.  Anyway, this envelope landed on my terrace.  Oh, God, I've been running up and down the block  looking for this.  You opened it?  How else could I have read it?  Listen, doll, you should read it too.  Without giving too much away,  it explains why you and your husband  don't have any children.  Are you going to take Rosario's advice  and spray on some of this love potion Numero Nueve  and get back out there?  Yeah, maybe.  I don't know.  What do you mean you don't know?  Didn't you hear Rosie?  I did, but did I?  I mean how do I know that I wasn't just your mark  and you weren't just telling me what I wanted to hear.  How can you say that?  Are you telling me when you kissed me  you didn't taste 409, Virginia Slims,  and a little whiff of venison jerky?  Well, the mind plays tricks.  The lightning, the thunder,  decades of hard drinking.  It was a perfect storm.  But I'm telling you, she was here.  Sure, honey.  Well, I am saddened by your attitude.  Ye of big boobs and little faith.  [THUNDER RUMBLING]  [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES]  Okay, okay.  Message received.  I'll keep trying.  Old black magic has me in its spell   Old black magic that you weave so well   Those icy fingers up and down my spine   The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine   The same old tingle that I feel inside   And then that elevator starts it's ride   -  Down -  Down and down I go  Around and around I go  Like a leaf caught in the tide   [PIANO MUSIC]  [SOBBING]  Grace?  I'm the worst person in the world.  I read your letter.  Come on inside.  I can't go inside.  I don't deserve to go inside. I'm horrible.  Grace, if we never let horrible people  in our apartment, we'd never see Karen.  - That's true. - Mm.  How did I not read this letter?  I mean, you went through so much after you came out  and I wasn't there for you.  We don't have to talk about it.  No, we do. I have to.  You were tortured.  And I never even thought about that.  When I got to the part where you write,  "Grace. I don't want to be gay.  I just wish I was normal."  Oh my god will.  That broke my heart.  And then the part where you said  that you were thinking about hurting yourself?  I mean, is that true?  Sweetie?  It was a long time ago.  Okay, look.  This might be 30 years too late.  But I just got smart in the last hour.  You're right. I didn't think about your pain.  I only thought about mine,  because that's the way the story of the gay guy  and the straight girl is always told.  Isn't it?  He broke her heart.  Poor her.  But you were just being who you are,  and you were scared to death  that the world was gonna find out  and hate you for it.  Wow.  You did get smart.  And you were right.  It is why I never say I'm sorry.  And I have been playing the victim.  So  I am going to say it now.  Doesn't it feel good?  Still haven't said it.  I didn't?  Oh! I am sorry.  I am sorry  for not being there with you.  I am sorry, Will.  I am sorry for not being there when you needed me most.  And I am so, so sorry  that I never said this to you before now.  The fact that you are a gay man  did not ruin my life.  It made it so much better.  Mine too.  Did you really go to a prostitute on Christmas?  I couldn't go in.  I just went to the House of Pies and ate my feelings.  Really, that was the inspiration  for "Homo with a Pie."  And you're gonna write that book one day.  If I dedicate it to you will you read it?  If by read it you mean skip to the parts that are about me  - I will absolutely read it. - [LAUGHS SOFTLY]  [PIANO MUSIC]     
                




                    			"Will & Grace" is recorded  in front of a live studio audience.  You got to help me.  My dad's on the way up, and he wants me  to drive to Schenectady with him.  Aww, that's nice.  You know that's not nice.  Don't be that guy.  Oh, that's awful.  Awful? He's my father.  Why don't you text me what you want me to say,  and I'll read it back?  Wow, if I could do that to myself,  I could delete my Grindr account.  Okay, okay.  Here is where you redeem yourself.  Let's do that thing where we pretend to have a thing.  - Hi, Daddy. - Hi, darling.  You ready to go?  Hey, Martin. How's my mom?  I mean, your wife?  I mean, my mom. I mean, your wife.  I'll get used to that.  No, I won't.  Dad, uh, about Schenectady,  I would love to go, but I forgot we  we have a thing.  Will? Thing?  Actually, the thing got cancelled.  No, it didn't. It's still a thing.  Damn that thing!  No, no. No longer a thing.  But the thing is too big a thing to no longer be a thing.  I don't know what you two are doing,  but I got to get some floss.  I got something stuck in my tooth.  I had an everything bagel.  It could be anything.  What the hell was that?  A long drive with your father  Grace, that's a gift.  I I'd give anything to have that kind of time  to talk to my dad again.  It is different with girls.  Your relationship with your dad changes  the second you get boobs.  So there's still time for you.  Come on. You know my dad.  We don't talk.  The minute anything gets real,  he gets uncomfortable.  I mean, my whole life, I've never seen him cry.  So push through the discomfort.  Talk about stuff that matters.  Ask him, "Are you afraid of death?  "Do you have any regrets?  Have you ever had a gay experience?"  My dad.  Would you ask your mom  if she's ever had a lesbian experience?  Sure, if I wanted her  to leave the room quickly in tears.  Surprise!  It was a sesame seed.  Come on, we'll stop by the cemetery,  visit your mother, and while we're there,  we'll say hi to Harry.  I'll visit Mom's grave, not Harry's.  Ugh, this Harry thing again. Oof.  Look at you two, having fun already.  I have a three-hour car drive to think of my revenge.  Wait, wait, wait.  I got it. Come with us.  - Please, please, please. - No, no. I can't.  I got I got Jack's engagement brunch.  That's today?  So I actually had a thing?  Ooh, I I would have to  remove two ribs to do that.   If you'd told me 20 years ago  I'd be celebrating my engagement,  I would've had so many questions.  Are gays allowed to get married?  Can they be in the military?  Mm-hmm.  And why would we want either of those things?  Ladies, are we enjoying?  Everything's marvelous, Ms. Coco, but FYI,  you shouldn't put celery in your Bloody Marys.  Too many vegetables hard on the liver.  Karen's kind of a health nut.  - Oh. - Yeah.  Anything I can do for you?  I mean, get for you  I mean, eat off you.  Coco, I'll say what I said to you  ten minutes ago at the urinal:  I'm fine, and my eyes are up here.  So who gets it?  - I'll take it. - I'll take it.  Oh, Wilma, no.  I'm paying.  My best friend is getting married.  My best friend is getting married.  Your best friend is in the basement of the White House,  trying to tunnel her way out  with the heel of her Jimmy Choo.  Children, make a decision.  I've got six more tables,  and I'm getting less tucked by the minute.  I think I can settle this.  The best man should pay.  And that's me.  Ooh, conflict.  We hate that here.  So, um, Daddy  I thought maybe we could talk.  What do you think we've been doing for the last two hours?  No, I mean I mean talk about  real stuff, you know?  Like, do you have any regrets?  Are you afraid of death?  Yes. No.  Okay, that covers it.  Uh  What the hell.  Have you ever had a gay experience?  Does breakfast with Will count?  Jack asked me to be his best man.  Wrong, Mary.  Jack asked me to be his best man.  Okay, okay, okay.  I asked you both.  I just didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.  I didn't want Will to think I preferred you  I do.  Over him.  I don't.  This is crazy! It should be me.  I've known Jack since he was 20  and for 20 years of his 30s.  Did you go on the Dark Web to buy him a real severed hand  for his Morticia Addams costume?  Wait.  That was a real severed hand?  Of course not.  What do I do? What do I do?  All right, let's not break a press-on.  When we have a dispute here, we settle it like men:  with a lip-sync monologue throw down!  What you do is, you spin this wheel  and then lip-sync whichever  legendary monologue it lands on.  Then the audience decides, with applause, who wins.  So we're going to determine something as important  as your best man by lip-syncing campy monologues  in a room full of drunken gay men?  Yeah.  - Yay! - Makes sense.  Girls, we've got ourselves a bitch royale.  What can I tell you?  I love laminated menus.  You know, the story of the restaurant in the back  interesting reading.  I'll wait for the movie.  Always with the smart answers, like your mother.  Hi! Hey, Patty.  It's my favorite waitress.  Hi, Mr. Adler.  Is this the new Mrs. Adler?  No, I'm his daughter, Grace.  Clearly the age of a daughter, not a wife.  Okay.  How is it you get prettier every year, eh?  Well, I'm pretty religious about using sunscreen.  May I tell you about today's specials?  We have broasted chicken,  whole breaded catfish plate,  shrimp salad  - I'll have that. - You stopped me.  I memorize the specials in order,  so if you stop me, I've got to go back to the top.  Sorry.  No, it's okay.  It's okay. I'll just start again.  Um, we have broasted chicken,  whole breaded catfish plate,  shrimp salad,  salmon croquettes with Creole sauce  Hmm.  Did that count as interrupting?  It did.  Oh, oh!  I've seen this one a million times.  It it used to be my  my go-to move to do it on a first date.  That's not sad.  Ooh, the "leave Britney alone" speech that fan gave  after Britney Spears screwed up at the VMAs.  It was sad-larious.  You are going down, Karen.  Hit it!  Leave Britney alone!  Please!  Perez Hilton talked about professionalism  and said if Britney was a professional,  she would've pulled it off, no matter what.  Speaking of professionalism, when is it professional  to publicly bash someone  who's going through a hard time?  Leave Britney alone!  Please!  Boo!  Boo! Boo!  Take off your pants!  Who said that?  Well, that wasn't half bad,  Britney Queers.  Now  Watch and learn.  Ah, the Wicked Witch monologue.  Straight out of the bible.  Broasted chicken,  whole breaded catfish plate,  shrimp salad  She'll have the salad. I'll have the Reuben.  Unless you're on the menu, sweetheart.  I am not,  although, my name is Patty,  and there are hamburger patties,  so I almost made it.  Why do you do that?  Flirting, calling women "sweetheart"?  - Ah, they love it. - They don't love it.  I mean, everybody's so sensitive nowadays.  Sometimes I feel like men can't be men anymore,  not with this, uh, #NotMe stuff.  - "Me Too." - Well, we agree on something.  And why are you being such a nudge?  Because it  You know what? It doesn't matter.  Let's just eat and then visit Mom.  - And then Harry. - No.  I told you. No Harry.  He was my best friend.  Well, he wasn't mine.  You know, it always bothered me,  this thing you have about Harry.  I got you a good job working for my best friend,  and you stole money.  You know how embarrassing that was for me?  - Dad - And you didn't apologize.  If you had apologized, things would be different.  - But you didn't apologize. - That's not what happened.  Well, you tell me what happened.  I don't want to talk about it.  Now you don't want to talk.  The whole summer that I worked for Harry,  I kept telling you he was creepy.  What did you think that meant?  Uh, I don't know. He was a flirty guy.  Oh, and and you thought that was okay?  Him flirting with your daughter?  - That was a different time. - No, no.  That's not an excuse.  What just because it was a different time,  it wasn't bad?  No, all that meant  was that people got away with it.  - Hey, calm down. - No, don't  Do not tell me to calm down.  - I can't do this. - Where you going?  I mean, what did he do? Pat you on the tushy?  No, he did more than that.  That doesn't sound like Harry.  He had his faults, but he was a good guy.  - He was not a good guy. - It was a long time ago.  - Maybe you're misremembering. - No, no! I remember!  I remember every single thing that happened that day.  I-I wait, I don't want to talk about it.  No, we're talking.  It was hot,  so I had to have my hair up,  and it showed off the earrings that I borrowed from Mom  that made me feel really grown up.  And then, at the end of the day,  Harry called me into his office.  - What are you talking about? - I walked in.  He shut the door, he closed the blinds,  and then he pushed me up against the wall.  Gracie, no.  I tried to scream,  but he told me "Quiet."  Then he started kissing me  and touching me,  and then he pulled down my pants,  put his fingers up  Stop!  I was 15.  I hate to interrupt the party,  but we ran out of shrimp salad.  I know.  I'm disappointed too.  Afterwards, I just wanted  to get away from him.  I just wanted to be home,  so I took money out of the drawer,  and I called a cab.  That's why I stole the money.  Why didn't you tell me?  How could I?  What if you didn't believe me?  What if nobody believed me?  Why didn't you see?  You're my father. You're supposed to protect me.  - I didn't know! - You should have.  You're right!  I'm so sorry, Grace.  I'm so sorry.  I didn't protect my little girl.  It's okay, Daddy.  No, it's not okay.  How can it be okay?  How did you get through it?  Well, you just kind of split yourself into two people.  The person it happened to  and the one who gets through the day.  And then you grow up,  and your life gets bigger  and that stuff gets smaller.  - Here are your waters. - Thank you.  I know the glasses look dirty,  but it's just the water.  Did you tell anyone else?  I told one person.  Good.  I'm glad you have a best friend.  Can you ever forgive me?  I can.  I'm not gonna visit that bastard in the cemetery.  I never want to hear his name again.  He's dead to me.  Well, he's dead to everybody, Daddy.  Just try!  I'll get you, my pretty,  and your little dog too!  Broom drop.  Who likes the drag queen?  And who likes my second husband,  should my first husband die a timely death?  We have a new dilemma.  We've never had a tied bitch royale.  Are you saying I've got to decide?  Or we could have a contest  to see which one knows you better.  Or you suggesting a public Jack-off?  Okay, Will, this question is to you.  In the fall of aught eight,  I had a brief, but torrid, affair  with a certain redhead.  Tell me his name, where we met,  and what food he threw at me  when I told him I met someone else.  Dick, dock, duck.  That is correct.  In your face, Walker!  Nicely done, Will.  Gorgeous and smart.  Oscar, I'm leaving you.  Oh, forget it.  - Okay, Karen. - Okay.  This one's for you.  It is a question about my "peh-nis."  I know it better than my own.  Ha-ha-ha!  - When fully aroused - Oh, yeah.  Like when Conor McGregor  is on the cover of "Men's Health"  or there is a light breeze  Yes.

I know I'm better.  I should be best man.  - Why would you - Stop, stop it, stop!  Stop! Stop, stop!  Why are we fighting over who's best man?  Isn't marriage just some weird thing  straight guys came up with as a way to own a woman?  And sure, it'd be great to own a woman.  You know, to open jars  or to hold your purse  while you and your boyfriend go on the Ferris wheel.  But we are gay men!  We make our own rules!  I say, let's reinvent marriage.  Yeah, rip it apart.  Take off the sleeves, fringe the bottom,  and crop the top!  So here's my new rule.  I'm gonna have two best men.  Because, yeah, we got gay marriage,  but let's make marriage gay!  Yeah, I can live with two best men.  Yeah, me too.  Grace, when did you get here?  And sure, it'd be great to own a woman.  You know, to open jars  or to hold your purse  while you and your boyfriend go on the Ferris wheel.  I can't believe you made it on the wheel at Ms. Coco's.  I know!  Everybody at the gay bar is doing me.  You haven't said that for years.  Honey, I've divided up  our responsibilities for the wedding.  Well, yours just says, "Show up if avail."  It's a big ask, but I love the guy.  - Hey. - Hey, Grace.  How did it go? Was it torture?  Uh, it was a lot of things.  But it was good. Really good.  Thanks for making me go.  So how was brunch?  Will and Karen did a Jack-off  to decide who would be my best man,  and you're never gonna guess who won.  Oh, oh they both did!  Will, tell her the story. Actually, don't.  You'll be boring. Karen, tell her.

Writes itself.  You know, you hear that,  but it's not true.  Right now the whole second act  is just a drawing of a horse.  Seriously, that's all I got.  Anyway, in the 11:00 number,  Gaybraham receives a letter from his lover.  [INDISTINCT MURMURING]  [AS LINCOLN] Why, it's from Joshua.  What a fine hand he has.  And oh, how that hand could relieve  the tensions of my southern uprising.  Is that too much? Not enough?  Oh, mwah. Just right.  Okay.  [AS LINCOLN] Let's see what my bosom companion  has to say.  [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC]    "Dear Mr. Lincoln   "Of you, sir, I've been thinking   "And am setting quill to parchment so you'll know   "That my head is in a fog   "Thinking of your Lincoln log   And how you put the 'man' in emancipation"   [VOCALIZING]  [KNOCKING ON DOOR]  It's not I  BOTH: What are you doing here?  Grace said you'd be gone  and to bring a bottle of  Skinnygirl Chardonnay.  She told me to meet her here  and make her a BLT, double mayo, double chips.  That's my favorite sandwich.  And that's my fav I've heard of that wine.  You know what happened here.  She "Parent Trapped" us.  I've never seen that movie,  but if it's about a guy going  to his girlfriend's place  and realizing he's not gonna get laid,  then yeah, we've been "Parent Trapped!"  [BRIGHT PIANO MUSIC]  I got a surprise for you! Our show poster is here.  [GASPS] What?  "Karen Walker presents"?  You mean my name is gonna be on this piece of show?  Duh! Everybody's talking about it.  All your friends are coming.  So far I've got RSVP'ed from Ivanka, Marlo,  all the Huckabee Sanderses  Oh, my gosh, and they are so supportive.  Okay. Whole new plan.  This play is gonna be good.  - But wasn't that always - Less Jack-ting, more acting.  From the top!  Okay. Okay.  And again, if you don't like anything,  - just yell, "Stop." - Okay.  Okay?  Ah-one, two  [SCREAMING] Stop!    So, uh,  Grace tells me you think I'm a bit of a dick.  - I never said that. - I know, I'm just being a dick.  Maybe we should find some common ground.  Okay. You like sports?  - I like ice skating. - Not a sport.  I'm guessing you prefer theater?  That is such a tired stereotype.  And yeah, I adore it.  Yeah, some plays are okay.  You know? But I I can't stand musicals.  Even worse, when they turn them into movies.  Don't get me started on "West Side Story."  You don't like "West Side Story?"  It's absurd.  It pretends to be a serious exploration  of immigrant plight, but it's just a bunch  of pirouetting theater majors  in windbreakers and Keds.  Windbreakers are the toughest of jackets.  The FBI wears 'em.  Come on, the guy playing Tony  is distractingly gay.  He is exactly the right level of gay.  The score is breathtaking,  the dancing is superb  Natalie Wood is completely miscast.  You stop right there.  Ooh, what are you gonna do, snap at me?  It's not up here.  It's a tight snap.  No.  No. Tight.  Ooh, we're both snapping. It's a rumble.  It's stylized choreography.  It's manly in its own way.  Yeah, no, I feel like a Navy SEAL.  Obviously you haven't seen it  in a while, so I'm gonna go get the DVD.  We're gonna watch it right now.  You'll see how great it is.  [RINGTONE CHIMING]  Hey, Katie.  Hey. Uh, no, I'm, uh,  I'm still working, but I can't wait to see you later.  Okay. All right.  I love you too. Bye.  You bastard.  No, it's not what you think.  I think you were telling another woman  that you love her.  She's not a woman, Will. She's 12.  Oh, my God!  It's my daughter what is wrong with you?  You have a daughter?  Why didn't you tell Grace?  Oh, man. I didn't bring it up the first date  because I didn't think it was going anywhere.  And then I didn't bring it up the second date  because I was pretty sure we were gonna have sex  and sometimes having a kid is a boner-killer for women.  And then I didn't bring it up on the third date  because by then it was weird  that I hadn't brought it up on the first two dates.  Look, if I could go back in time,  I'd tell her on the first date.  Of course, if I could actually go back in time,  I'd kill Hitler, invest in Apple,  then tell Grace.  You know, Grace doesn't really like to be lied to.  It wasn't a lie, okay? It was an omission.  Come on, you're a guy.  You've never hidden anything  from someone you were dating?  Nothing this big.  Really? When you were dating Grace,  you didn't withhold certain information,  like  oh, I don't know, the fact that you're gay?  Oh, that was completely different.  - How? - Mine was much worse.  Look. Please don't tell her.  I have to, Noah.  We tell each other everything.  - Is that healthy? - Not in the slightest.  But now we're dealing with you.  I screwed up, okay?  I need to fix it. And I will.  I care about Grace.  Well, there's our common ground.  You got 24 hours to tell her.  Okay, I'll, I'll tell her at dinner tomorrow night.  Good, but not during dessert.  You ruin Grace's dessert,  God help you.  [BRIGHT PIANO]    Jackie.  I'm gonna take off my producer hat  and put on my friend hat.  As a friend,  I love that you're pursuing your passion.  Aw, Karen.  Okay. Gonna put my producer hat back on.  Your play sucks harder than a girl with daddy issues.  But you just said  That was as a friend.  But as a producer, I can tell you  [GRUFF VOICE] Your friends are lying to you.  Well.  Putting on my actor hat,  my writer scarf,  my singer lozenge,  and my dancer character shoes,  I will quote the opening number of Act Four  when Old Abe says to Dream Ballet Abe,  "What the hell have you been drinkin', Lincoln?"  Okay.  Let me spell this out for you, Shakes-queer  If you put a broom on a circus floor  after the elephant parade  and swept it all into one big pile  it would still be a smaller turd than this thing.  Putting on my friend hat for a moment.  That was hilarious.  But I toss that hat across the room  and get into my serious artist jumpsuit,  and I say to you as long as  I am the lead in this play,  we are gonna do things my way!  As long as you are the lead  of this play,  we are going to do things your way.  [MOCK LAUGHING]  Understood.  As long as I am the lead of this play,  we're gonna do things my way  I mean, that's bulletproof, right?  [BRIGHT PIANO]  I'm so mad.  Wait till I tell you what happened at dinner.  Sweetie, I'm so sorry.  Right? It's my favorite skirt  and the waiter spilled a bowl of soup  all over it.  But you didn't know that.  What are you sorry about?  I'm a gay man.  I can always sense when  something bad has happened  to s-suede.  Wait a minute, what's wrong?  Wine, tissues, charcoal facial masks.  All we need is a box of doughnuts  and it's the Grace Adler comfort kit.  What is that?  - Give it give give it - Don't wait!  [GASPS]  You know something.  What is going on?  Noah was weird at dinner, now you're being weird.  It's not my secret to tell.  Now it's a secret?  Is he Is he dating someone else?  Oh, my God, if I turned another guy gay,  I'm jumping out of the window.  Grace.  I know, you can't turn people gay,  you can only make them wish they were.  He has a daughter.  What?  And he didn't tell me?  What else didn't he tell me?  And why wouldn't he tell me?  These are questions you'd have to ask him.  But you can't ask him.  - Why not? - Because if you ask him,  he'll know I told you  and I promised him I wouldn't.  Well, why would you do that?  We tell each other everything.  Yeah, but is that healthy?  Oh, we are so far past that.  Where are the doughnuts?  As soon as he is done explaining to the Uber driver  why he's only getting one star,  I'm getting answers.  No, no, you, you, you  Look, you want Noah and I to get along.  I-If he finds out that I told you,  that's out the window. He'll hate me.  We'll start snapping at each other.  It'll get ugly.  You can't say anything.  I get it.  You're right.  Okay, fine. I won't say anything.  Hey.  You have a kid?  [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC]  - You made me love you   You really got your licks in   Below my Mason-Dixon   Can we can we stop a second?  A-Are you sure this works?  Jon Cryer, anything that doesn't work  is going to change.  Okay, good, because  I-I was a little worried about that part  where you changed the lyric  in the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" to,  "Glory, glory, hole-lelujah?"  Okay, people, let's take it from  John Wilkes Booth, what is the meaning of all this?  I've been asking that question since I got here.  Hush, you, whoever you are.  You replaced me with Jon Cryer?  The producers decided to go another way.  You're the only producer.  Yes, and I fought for you, honey,  but I was outvoted.  This is unbelievable.  It's bad enough you recast me in my own play  but did it have to be with my arch-rival?  We're rivals?  Don't pretend like you don't know who I am.  I don't have to.  Okay, kittens, let's not ruin our manicures.  Back to rehearsal.  I don't know if it'll help, but okay.  I don't believe this.  You said you loved this play.  You said you believed in me.  I never said that.  [RECORDED KAREN]: I love this play!  I believe in you.  Yeah. Well, you said I could replace you  if I wanted to.  I never said that.  [KAREN AS JACK]: You can replace me whenever you like.  This is Jack talking.  That's not my voice.  Oh, no one ever thinks they sound like themselves.  Uh, should I leave?  No, no, Jon Cryer.  I wanna hear the closing speech.  If that's all right with you.  Why ask me?  It would appear this partnership is over.  Oh. Then we have nothing left to say to each other.  This is how our friendship ends.  Stabbed in the back by my best friend  in a theater, just like Lincoln!  [BRIGHT PIANO]  You gave me 24 hours!  You gave him 24 hours?  What, are you a Bond villain?  You said you were gonna tell her at dinner.  I was going to, but she spilled soup on her skirt.  You said the waiter spilled soup on your skirt.  Okay, so I lied, but I'm not the liar here.  And yes, I heard what I just said.  And then I was distracted  because your shirt's been open all night.  It's a look! Read a magazine!  I cannot believe that you didn't tell me  that you have a kid!  - You never asked. - You should have told me  without me having to ask!  You can't get mad at me for something I didn't tell you  - that you didn't ask. - You can't get mad at her  for not asking something that you should have told her  without having to ask!  Wait, wait. Where were we?  The bottom line, you should  have told Grace from the start.  Yeah, you don't think I know that?  Do you have any idea how hard this has been?  I wanted to tell you.  Well, then why didn't you?  Because I didn't think we'd be here.  Where?  In a living room? New York?  Here. Us.  What do you mean, Noah?  Oh, come on. What are you doing to me, huh?  You know I have feelings for you.  Did you hear that, Grace?  I did.  But I need to hear more.  Well, I feel good about this.  I-I-I, you know, I think  you guys have have y-your differences,  but I think if you can get together  I meant I need to hear more from him.  Right. Right. I'm gonna go.  I'll be in my I'm just going to, uh,  take my Skinnygirl  or whatever it's called, I don't know!  So, we good?  No.  You said you have feelings.  I need to know what that means.  Yeah, why? Why? Why do I have to explain?  Because I have spent too much of my life  chasing after emotionally wishy-washy guys  and I don't have time for it anymore.  I know who I am. I know what I need.  I'm not ready for this conversation. Okay?  You just said that you have feelings for me  and now you can't tell me what they are?  Yeah, I need time, all right? I need time to just  Okay, all right, you need time?  You have 24 seconds to tell me  how you feel about me.  24 sec Will gave me 24 hours.  - 19. - No, oh, come on.  You know how I feel.  - Why do I have to even - Ten.  No, oh, okay.

You do anything you want.  So you don't think it's a big turd?  I can honestly say  it's as good as anything you've ever done.  [BRIGHT PIANO]    Tell me about your daughter.  Well, her name's Katie.  She's 12.  And every time she calls me Dad  I feel like I won something I don't deserve.  That's so nice.  I bet you're a great dad.  Well, I want to be.  And that's why, that's why  I didn't bring her up at first.  You know? I'm protective.  She means the world to me.  - Well, I won't tell anyone. - [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]  But you are a lot sweeter than you pretend to be.  Don't screw with my brand, Adler.  Bye.  So when can I meet her?  Oh, yeah, that's that's not happening.  [BRIGHT PIANO]     
                




                    			1 "Will and Grace" is shot before a live studio audience.  What do you mean, I can't meet your daughter?  I didn't mean you couldn't ever meet her.  Obviously you will when the time is right.  - And when will that be? - When the time is right.  Hi. Hello. Good evening to you both.  I'm in the middle of memorizing my lines  for my one-man show "Gaybraham Twinkin',"  so if you could keep it down that would be  [KISSES] chef's kiss.  Noah, always a pleasure.  Grace, we talked about a side pony after 40.  [DOOR CLOSES]  "When the time is right."  - You just said you loved me. - I did say that.  And by the way, I feel like we're forgetting,  that's the headline here.  Today's the day I said I love you.  Yes, but today's also the day I found out you have  a daughter I can't meet. That's the other headline.  Yeah, you can't have two headlines.  It's just bad journalism. Look, I'm sorry.  I love you, and I'm not ready for you to meet Katie.  Both those things are true.  - I gotta look out for her. - "Look out for her"?  What do you think I'm gonna do?  [SIGHS] - Hi.  Good evening.  Maybe I wasn't clear  but this 21st century hetero argument  is kind of killing the 1860s homo-realism  I'm trying to create here.  Noah.  Always a pleasure.  Look, Grace, you will meet Katie, okay?  When I feel the time is right.  Okay, Noah.  Um, when you're in a relationship,  you share your life.  That's how you grow, and you are not ready for that,  so call me when you are.  Wait, wait, wait. Why am I giving you the power?  I'll call you when I'm ready for you to be ready.  What part of ah, very good.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   Listen, I don't know much about this guy  but it sounds like you found another one  who's not batting for our team.  Karen, I've been dating Noah for two months.  You split a calzone with him three days ago in the office.  That doesn't sound like me.  I like a full calzone.  I'm so sorry, sweetie.  I know it was a tough call to make.  But you feel like you did the right thing?  100%, mm-hmm.  - What? - Nothing.  No, I just he was only asking for a little more time  - for his daughter's sake, and - What?  Do you really want to date someone  who doesn't put their kid first?  Fine, I'll tell him I'll meet Katie on his terms.  [YELLS] Happy?  - Why are you mad at me? - Because I don't want to be mad at me.  See you at the office.  That's an expression, right?  - Oh, Marilyn. - Mom, what are you doing  - in the city? - I needed to see you.  Oh, uh, Marilyn?  Um, I I have to run,  but it is so nice seeing you.  Mom.  Grace, neither of us enjoy that.  What's going on? Everything okay?  Well, I have some devastating news,  and I don't know how I can tell you.  Hey, Marilyn. Ooh. I love what you're wearing.  Oh, thank you, Karen.  - They just opened - Mom!  - What's the devastating news? - Well  Your brother died.  - What? - He was doing his business  in the neighbor's yard, starting shaking,  and then he "pff" just fell over.  - My God. - Oh  Poor Dr. Silly.  Wait, your dog?  I thought you meant Sam or Paul!  And you made me picture them pooping in the neighbor's yard!  Pooping and then dying!  That's my that's my worst fear!  Dr. Silly was much more than a dog, William.  He was a member of the family.  - He was your brother! - Mom.  Oh, oh, was he the one who dated Grace  and Will got all mad?  Yeah, and Will's like, "You can't date  my mother's dog!"  In any case, I'm collecting video testimonials  to show at the service, and I was hoping  - that you would make one. - Oh, sure, sure.  Maybe I'll talk about how much he loved  chasing marbles or humping the ottoman.  Though I I kind of wanted to save that for Jack's eulogy.  Jokes, William?  I thought you of all people would understand.  - What Mom. - I'm going to lie down.  I  You know  I never really got the pet thing.  I mean, if you want something with four legs  and a chip in its neck I'd just hire two more maids.  What did that mean, "me of all people"?  She never shows her emotions and I never know how  to deal with it when they suddenly pop out.  Honey, the woman is grieving.  It is time for you to dig down deep  and pull out one of your sad,  low-limit credit cards you have  and buy her something.  Well, she does like presents. Thanks.  You'll-you'll stay here with her?  Oh, no, honey. Not really my thing.  - We don't have much in common. - She's scared of foreigners  - and loves to drink. - Well, maybe I could stay  for a little while.    Morning, boss.  Um, as you know I'm in rehearsal  for my original one-man show based on Abraham Lincoln's  secret gay romance, "Gaybraham Twinkin'."  Let me guess. You're trying you skip out of here  early again today.  I find your use of the word  "skip" slightly homophobic.  But yes, I will need to prance my gay ass out of here by 2:00.  Hold on!  This is your job, Jack. I need you here.  Not out doing some ridiculous play, okay?  "Ridic"  Need I remind you  what Abraham Lincoln represents to this country?  I don't think you need to remind me.  Abe represents this nation's struggle  for gay men to celebrate their love freely, in the open,  where people of all creeds and colors can watch,  and based on appearance perhaps join in.  Lincoln freed the slaves, dude.  He wasn't gay.  He was one of three gay presidents:  Lincoln, Harrison,  and that confirmed old bachelor:  James "Power Bottom" Buchanan.  Is no one editing Wikipedia anymore, like?    Noah?  It's me.  Hello?  Hi. My dad's not home.  You're Katie.  The Katie. I'm meeting Katie.  You must be my new math tutor, right?  - Kimiko? - Um  Yes, I am Kimiko.  Come on in.    Wait, there's a second train leaving the station  at the same time?  And this one's going ten miles an hour?  What is this, the 1800s?  You're not my math tutor, are you?  Good question.  - I am not. - So, who are you?  I'm Grace  and I'm kind of seeing your dad.  Oh.  - Hi. - Hi.  I mean, he does seem happy lately.  He hasn't said "fascists" in like a week.  Oh! [CHUCKLES] I did that!  But he didn't feel like you were ready to meet me yet,  so I should I should leave.  - And we never met. - Right.  But it's the only lie we will ever tell your dad.  Katie, I'm home!  We will tell him one more lie.  - Hey, kiddo. - Hi, Dad.  Hey, put these on the counter.  - Hi! What are you doing home? - Your math tutor called  to cancel and I didn't want you hanging out alone.  Hey, you know what, this is the problem  with the gig economy.  People cobble together an income  out of all these jobs and they don't  Don't commit to any of them.  - Love you. - [CHUCKLES]  Wait!  I need to tell you something.  Something really important.  What? You're vaping?  You know, it may taste like banana pudding,  but it's just banana-flavored cancer.  Wait, Dad!  You must be Katie.    I don't know why Will is being so insensitive.  - It's it's very - Un-gay-like?  Yes.  - Oh, is that wrong to say? - No.  You made him gay, so naturally, it's upsetting  when he doesn't act that way.  Well, you understand.  You must have had a furry companion  at some point.  I've never had a pet, and Stan wasn't that furry.  Well, you're missing out, Karen.  - Hm. - You know how impossible it is  to show love to people?  Go on.  Well, it's so easy with dogs.  [DOOR OPENS] - Did somebody order  four pounds of cuteness?  What is this?  It's your new dog! Isn't she adorable?  She could have been Dr. Silly's more attractive partner  in the practice, you know?  Who, uh who writes a health column  in "The Daily Growl." [LAUGHS]  You can't swap out one dog for another.  I mean, when you and Vince broke up did I swap him out  for another gay man to cheer you up?  Yes.  You fixed me up with Tim O'Dell  - who was straight, by the way. - Oh.  You told me that you made out with him.  And it took a long time to get him there.  [DOG BARKING]  Karen, would you take her for a walk?  - Here. - [SIGHS]  [DOG GROWLING]  Okay, Marilyn, let's go.  Come on.  Come on, come on.  Come. Come, Marilyn, come on.  [KISSING] - The dog.  What, you thought I meant my mother?  Well, I don't know.  She's had a lot to drink.  Ugh.  Another dog.  Oh, God, I can't believe  that that's what you think I needed.  I don't understand.  I I don't know how to help you.  It's it's just like when Dad died.  Oh, was it?  And how would you know that?  Because I was there?  For a week after the funeral,  and then you went right back to your life.  And I had no one.  That's when I got Dr. Silly.  Mom, I'm sorry, I didn't  I wish you had told me that you needed me.  Well, you should have known.    Jack, are you out of your mind?  The Underground Railroad was a secret network  to get slaves to the north,  not a gay club with a subway theme.  Oh, really? Then where did I ride my first caboose?  You do recognize as a black man  I know, I know. [SIGHS]  You can't hide the color of your skin,  but I can hide my gayness.  [INSECT BUZZING] [SHRIEKS] Oh, my God!  Oh!  It was just a fly. I thought it was a bee.  I'm tragically allergic.  One sting and my face blows up  bigger than Liza on Prednisone.  Anyway, what were we saying?  - You can hide your gayness. - Right, right.  I'll give you that.  Hi, I'm looking for Theodore?  - I'm here to fix the AC. - Oh, yeah, man,  it's right over there.  Excuse me, sir. Uh, I was hoping  you could settle an argument for us.  Who's more oppressed: A black person or a gay person?  - That's a ridiculous question. - I know, right?  Nobody has it worse than Latinos.  They're putting our kids in cages.  How about all the African-American men  - that are locked up in cages? - Due to a lack of funds  I've sometimes been forced to dance in cages.  Who's zoomin' who, fellas?  [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Delivery.  So the order is: Latinos have it worse, then black men,  - then gay guys. - Oh, no, no, no.  You've got to move Muslims on the top of that list.  Try being me getting on a plane.  Or try being me getting a taxi.  Try being me and getting back in the country.  Try being me and having to claim Kevin Spacey  as one of your own.  Well, he was good in "The Usual Suspects."  Would you want him to be black?  Okay, I see your point.  Jack! I just got your check by mistake.  How do you make more money than me?  Because you're a man?  [GOOFY VOICE] No, Dana.  Because I work harder than you.  - [SCOFFS] - And I am also a gay man  who we just all agreed  is the most oppressed group there is.  [ALL SHOUTING]    I didn't think that Katie would be here,  and then she answered the door, and so I had to pretend  that I was her math tutor.  Wait a minute, you pretended to be Kimiko?  That's that's ridiculous.  I know. I am clearly not Japanese.  No, I meant the part about you tutoring math.  I mean, you use the tip calculator on the phone.  Hey, 20% is hard.  No, it's ten plus ten.  Okay, 13% is hard.  [SIGHS] Okay, look, I screwed up.  I know that. I know that, and I am so sorry.  But the good news here  is that Katie and I hit it off.  No, that only makes things worse.  See, this is why I didn't want you to meet her yet.  Because now you guys have, like, a thing,  so when we break up she gets hurt.  Wait, "when we break up"?  No, that's not what I meant to say.  I mean, it's not like I'm I'm planning.  But you assume this is gonna end.  Grace, come on.  We've both been divorced, okay?  I'm just being a realist.  I mean, name one relationship that lasts and is any good.  There's so many!  But right now, for some reason, I can only think  of "Lady and the Tramp."  Oh, please. This fantasy that they can  just overcome their class differences  because they both like pasta.  So, what? All relationships are doomed?  There's no point loving anyone and life sucks?  No, I'm just saying there's zero probability  that you throw two people together  - and it's going to last forever. - "Zero"?  - Then what are we doing? - "What are we doing"?  What do you mean? I I said I love you, okay?  That keeps getting bumped off the front page.  I don't know what you want me to say.  I want you to say that there's a chance  that you and me won't break up.  I mean, I can't do this if there's no hope.  - Grace, come on. - I mean, can't you say that  to me, Noah? I mean, can't you say  that there's a chance?  Wow.  Okay, then.  Goodbye, Noah.  [DOOR OPENS]  And Lady and the Tramp did end up together.  There was a DVD sequel  where they had a son named Scamp.    [ALL SHOUTING]  Wait, wait! Wait!  You think "Crazy Rich Asians" makes up for Panda Express?  It doesn't.  How is it that they still allow the fat guy  to be the butt of the joke?  Ralph just said "fat" and "butt."  [ALL LAUGHING] - Good one!  All right! All right, okay!  First it goes black person, then Muslim  - Yeah. - Then Latino,  then everybody else.  [ALL SHOUTING]  Stop!  This is crazy. Does it really make sense  for us to fight over who's the most oppressed?  Well, the elderly are practically invisible  in this country.  Where is that coming from?  - Over here. - It's nothing, keep going.  You guys, look at us.  Every single person in this room is part  of a group that has known suffering.  - And what unites us? - The struggle?  Wrong, sir!  But that was the name of my first bondage bar.  The theater!  And no play delivers this message  in a more powerful, toe-tapping way  than "Gaybraham Twinkin'."  Is there a matinee?  Who is saying that?  Well, I'm glad everybody got to say their piece.  Maybe that's the way we'll start to heal.  Exactly, and as long as we respect  each other's struggles, then we can finally  come together, right?  You, sir. I didn't get a chance to talk to you.  What's your deal?  Well, as a straight white male,  I believe right now  I'm under attack more than any other group in America.  Oh, my God, that door just closed by itself.    [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  Thank you for a wonderful visit.  [SIGHS] Mom, you don't mean that.  - It's called being polite. - Look wait, wait, wait.  Look, look  since Dad passed I I  I haven't checked in as much as I should have,  and I'm sorry.  - I've been a bad son. - No.  You're not a bad son.  - Well - You're a bad gay son.  What?  Karen hit the nail on the head today.  I made you gay, but I'm not getting any  of the benefits.  Oh, God, I left you alone with Karen.  That's that's me. That's my bad.  That's on me.  I knew after Dr. Silly died  that I couldn't go to Sam and Paul.  They'd think I was being ridiculous.  You thought I'd be more supportive  - because I sleep with men? - Oh  Every woman I know with a gay son  is best friends with him.  Look at Dianne and Jerry.  They have their own YouTube channel.  You don't want me to be like Jerry.  He wears a cape to the grocery store.  He's he's like the world's gayest superhero.  And when her cat Lord Bumbles died  he took her on a "Downton Abbey" river cruise.  I'm confused here.  Are you saying you want me to be gayer  or us to be closer?  Yes.  Come come here.  I am the exact amount of gay  that I'm ever gonna be, but we can hang out more.  I can be more sensitive to what you need.  Oh, that's what I want.  Yeah. And you know, Jerry's single.  And the four of us could just have so much fun together.  Doing what?  Pretending that the two of us don't see them holding hands?  - And he loves his mother. - And so do I.  Aww  Okay, that's enough.  We're not Lutherans.  Marilyn [SIGHS]  This dog and I have fallen madly in love  and I am prepared to fight you for her.  Will, you're my attorney.  Bury her in paperwork.  You can have her.  Oh, you hear that, Shou-Shou? You're mine.  What say we go to the park and bury some bones?  Doesn't matter whose as long as we're together.    Orange beef, lemon chicken,  and shrimp lo mein.  How many people?  Um, there's six of us.  Hold it down, everybody, I'm trying to order.  Okay.  [KNOCKING ON DOOR]  Oh, that must be the pizza.  Okay, there's a chance.  - Okay. - But you gotta know  this scares the crap out of me.  I know. It's supposed to.  'Cause I'm not this guy, okay?  I'm a pessimist. I can't be  Hey.  You said there was a chance.  That's the headline.  Wanna go grab a drink or something?  I'm taking care of the tip.  Sure.  You get the elevator, I'll get my purse.

Names are hard.  - I'm McCoy. - I'm, um  - Will, your name is Will. - Will[LAUGHS]  I know I know my name.  So you're the smart one,  and you are the delightful, shallow friend.  I have a similar dynamic with a buddy of mine.  I'd say who it is, but out of respect  for his privacy, I'm not going to.  - Well, we would never ask - It's Andy Cohen.  [CHUCKLES] Stop looking for a pore.  You're not gonna find one.  You're like a dolphin.  Hey, would you like to go out sometime?  - Absolutely. - Great.  Call me.  What's your number?  My number is, I'm McCoy Whitman.  Your smart friend can figure it out.  You're a genius.  "Del-ubitably."  [UPBEAT MUSIC]  Oh, Karen, I'm so sorry.  It's not just about the money.  It's about how after everything  Stan's put me through, he wins.  Well, he shouldn't.

I like what I like.  - Jack, are you seeing anyone? - Engaged.  Why are all the good ones either smart, taken,  or Anderson Cooper?  He's a dear friend. We share a locker at Equinox.  I can bench press more than he can.  You're you're kinda insecure,  aren't you?  That's why I don't date smart guys.  William Elizabeth Truman  You put our friendship above having a one-night stand  with a hot guy who's on TV every night.  Yeah, I guess I did.  You dumb bitch.  I was this close to having him in the palm of your hand.  - I can't even look at you. - [DOOR CLICKS]  Thanks for not letting him call me an idiot.  You're not.  And you're welcome, buddy.  You need to get your door fixed.

Hold on.  I gotta get that butterfly off your shoulder.  Thanks  Must have come from over there.  I don't remember putting in a butterfly door,  but I like it.  Ha-ba-da, bee-ba-da   Oh, street meat.  It's my one vice. Shh.  One, please.  Huh, that's unusual.  Oh, crap.  I forgot I was performing tonight.  Oh, thanks, honey.  Testing, testing. Is this thing on?  Check, check, one. Check, one, two.  - So, shall we look at fabrics? - Hold on.  I want my girlfriend to weigh in.  Of course. I didn't know you were seeing anyone.  She's new. Babe!  Never been good at relationships,  probably 'cause I'm a bitch.  Okay, so, for the sofa, I was thinking that  What up, Smudge?  Janet, what are you doing here?  Her.  You have got to be kidding me.  I'm a lesbian now.  Deal with it.  Poor thing.  I'm gonna take her shoes.  Your skin is so soft.  It's so soft.  It's so, like  what is the word I'm thinking of?  - Soft? - Yes!  You always find the word.  I know so many words.  Like what?  Cassoulet  oh, I know there are others.  It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.  Words are just things people say.  Yes, yes, yes. It's like we're beyond words.  Those are words.  "Soulmate." There's a word.  It's like that's the biggest word there is  not in terms of letters  Cassoulet is longer but the idea.  - Yeah. - What is a soulmate?  Soulmate, soulmate. Hey, let's look at the word.  - Let's look at it. - Huh?  Oh, air-finger cursive.  It's a lost art.  Right? Write?  Right?  Soulmate a soulmate is someone who knows you  better than anyone, who takes care of you,  someone who knows what you need before you e  Why did you just hand me  A tissue?  Are you my soulmate?  I might be. How would we know for sure?  Whoever this ring fits,  is my soulmate.  Ow. Ow.  Ow  It fits!  Okay, okay, this is happening.  Told you she'd be weird about it.  She doesn't want to think about her sister having sex.  Well, who does, besides Angelina Jolie's brother?  This conversation makes me wanna do heroin again.  Let's look at fabrics.  Yes, fabrics. Of course.  Um, and I also brought some new carpet samples  She's already seen a new carpet sample.  Soon as it came out of my mouth.  How did we not notice this before?  My soulmate was right across the hall!  Mine too!  I mean, it's so obvious. We finish each other's  - Penises. - That's what I was gonna say.  Okay, what am I thinking right now?  - I'm not getting anything. - I wasn't thinking anything!  Do you know what this means? Do you know what this means?  I have to tell Estefan you're my soulmate before I marry him.  He'll totally understand. Call him now.  Oh, okay. Excellent.  I just have to wait for that rabbit to get off the phone.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Wanda, Wanda, listen, no.  You're the one who wanted an open relationship.  Oh, I'm so glad you're my soulmate.  - Me too. - I'm gonna make you a sandwich.  - I don't want a sandwich. - Excuse me?  I said I don't need you to make me a sandwich.  Of course you do. I take care of you.  - I'm your soulmate. - I already ate with Estefan.  Well, just un-eat with him.  I refuse!  You bitch!  Get out! I never wanna see you again.  I never wanna be seen by you!  Hey, babe, what are we feeling about the wall color?  Why? Do we think it's too dark?  I think we might.  Oh, I think we think it works.  And how about we leave the designing to the designer  instead of the woman who thinks the paper flip-flops you get  after a pedicure are okay to wear synagogue?  That's homophobic.  Uh, okay. It's not.  And you are not a lesbian.  You're an Adler. We don't work that hard.  I'm sorry.  Donna, my sister is just as straight as I am.  - Are you? Are you? Are you? - Yes, yes.  Watch out. This is where it happens.  Oh, that must be  my intervention I keep rescheduling.  You always think you're gonna have time.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you so much.  Benny and I are going to take it down a notch.  This one is for my man  The one that got away.  Jack? Jack!  Will, Will!  - Will! - I'm over here.  Will, I was so lost.  What's happening to us?  I don't know.  But I don't feel comfortable talking about it  in front of her.  - Praise be. - Under his eye.  What are you doing?  Just because you go out with guys without jobs, cars,  or all of their fingers doesn't make you gay.  Why can't you be happy for me?  Because, honestly, I think that this is a little pathetic.  I am not pathetic.  - You say I'm not pathetic. - No.  - Pick a city. - No!  - Pick a city! - Philadelphia.  - P-H-I-L-A - Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Why don't I ever say LA?  Fine! Be a lesbian.  Have a Pussy Riot! Whatever.  Just don't screw up this job for me.  - How am I screwing it up? - Because it's what you do.  You always make my life so difficult.  I mean, my God, you are my older sister.  You're supposed to be the one to take care of me.  It's true. I'm a terrible big sister.  - Come on, Janet. - What? I am.  And I hate that.  When you were born, mom put you in my arms and said,  "This is your baby.  You have to take care of her."  And I wanted to.  I loved you so much.  You put me into a basket and threw me into a pond.  That's what Moses' mom did.  I was trying to give you a better life.  You are not a failure.  If anything, I am.  Mom said, "Life is harder for Janet.  Be kind to her."  And I haven't been.  Look, if you are a lesbian, I will support you happily.  I don't know if I am  Donna's cool.  And she played me like a banjo.  Well, you just ruined Mumford & Sons for me.  - I'm a mess. - Who isn't?  Now that mom's gone,  maybe we should do that thing she always wanted us to do.  Neither one of us is gonna marry Josh Groban.  No. Look out for each other.  Isn't that what sisters do?  I love you, Janet.  I love you so much.  Good riddance   Good-bye   Every trick of his   You're on to   But fools will be fools   And where's he   Gone to?   The road is rougher   It's lonelier and tougher   With hope you burn up   Tomorrow he may turn up   There's just no letup   The livelong night   And day   Ever since this world began   There is nothing   Sadder than   A one-man woman   Looking for   The man that got   Away   The man   That got   Away   Bravo!  How you feeling?  Better, although I do miss the butterflies.  Oh, God! Oh.  Do I need to say anything to the school  about my students lacing chocolate milk with drugs?  Depends, I mean,  do you wanna do the right thing,  or be the cool teacher that all the kids like?  - Eh, they're adults. - Yeah.  You know, all that stuff we said about soulmates  and sandwiches that was because of the  we were chocolate milking, right?  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  I mean  - What? - Nothing, I  When you get married,  you're still gonna need me, right?  I mean, Estefan can have "soulmate,"  but I'm not losing "best friend."  Ugh. You're so obsessed with me.  Of course you're my best friend, silly.  Well, let's make it official.  Jack, I'm asking you,  in front of God,  and all the high-end male erotica in this apartment.  Do you promise to be in my life forever?  I do.  I promise to be here through all your weight fluctuations  Mm-hmm.  Every relationship you trick a man into being a part of  Mm.  All the botched cosmetic surgery I'm sure  Okay, you're done. You're good. You're good.  And I I promise  to always lend you money,  to not get mad when you return my suit with the ass cut out,  It said, "business casual."  I know, buddy.  - Hey, Will. - Mm, yeah?  You can make me that sandwich now.  I'd love to, but when we were high,  I used all the bread to retile the bathroom.  Good-bye,  Mrs. Stanley Walker.     
                




                    			1 "Will & Grace" is recorded  in front of a live studio audience.  Okay, obviously it's a big day tomorrow.  [TOGETHER] Hm?  And I don't know what you have planned for my birthday  [TOGETHER] Uh.  But we have to postpone.  [TOGETHER] Aw.  Oh, it was good, wasn't it?  Did you get me something really good?  - We did but we could just - Get our deposit back on the  - Massage chair. - Unicorn.  A unicorn massage chair?  I thought those got recalled because of the lawsuits.  You guys, that is genius. You guys are the best.  But I've got problems  that even a unicorn massage chair couldn't solve.  It's Karen and Estefan. They hate each other.  Wait, since when?  She called him the one thing  you can never call a flight attendant  A sky waitress.  And he called her the one thing  you can never call Karen Walker,  a hag.  Sure, it's okay to say it to some  Why are you looking at me?  Because you're my hag.  When did we stop using the word "friends"?  Okay, fine. You're my friend's hag.  Anyway, luckily, Estefan is working the LaGuardia/Paris,  Paris/Hong Kong, Hong Kong/ Sydney, Sydney/Fiji,  Fiji/Dallas, Dallas/Des Moines, Des Moines/LaGuardia  leg this week,  so Karen has me all to herself for my birthday.  Oh, can't you guys just talk it out?  Oh, no, they can't even be in the same room together.  They're like Peanut Butter and Chocolate.  Those two dogs downstairs who hate each other.  Fortunately I can keep them separate with my new app.  It beeps whenever either one of them is within 100 feet of me.  See?  Oh, look, there's Karen. Twenty feet.  - [BEEPING] - Fifteen feet.  Twenty feet?  Ah, she forgot which apartment you're in again.  [SCREAMING] Karen, it's 9C.  Oh, hi, kids.  Oh, I like the new place.  Poodle, I just ordered your birthday present  and I think you're going to love it.  I hope it's not a unicorn massage chair,  because that's what they got me.  [LAUGHING] A unicorn massage chair  that's ridiculous.  Does yours talk?  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   Stop making a fist.  Everything all right?  You're usually so much smarter than a toddler.  I just found out that the head of my department  isn't going to approve me for a full time teaching position.  He's got this idea in his head that  I'm some rich corporate lawyer that just wants to teach  because it sounds good at cocktail parties.  Well, you do bring it up a lot at cocktail parties.  I'm tired of talking about gluten and Putin.  You know, one thing that I've learned  since I've entered the world of politics  You are not in the world of politics.  I'm running for president of the New York society  of interior designers.  Are you saying that's not politics?  I believe I just did.  It's politics.  And I learned that it all comes down to changing perceptions.  So this guy thinks that you're uptight and robotic.  I never said that. He never said that.  No one ever said that.  [ROBOTICALLY] I never said that.  He never said that. Nobody ever said that.  Will, you have got to humanize yourself.  Invite this guy over for dinner.  Be vulnerable. And whenever you can, cry.  I'm not gonna cry, but dinner is not a bad idea.  Give me some one-on-one time.  You know, let him know how serious I am about teaching.  Great, and when that does nothing,  tell him about how you killed your dog  and then cry like a baby.  I did not kill Belvedere.  He ran into the road after a squirrel.  Did the squirrel leave the door open?  First of all, I was seven.  Second of all, I was airing out the living room  after hot gluing rosettes to a table skirt.  How did you not come out until college?  I still can't believe you got us into the Lily Pond  New York's premiere pond-themed restaurant.  Stan and I used to come here all the time.  After we split up, I got all the restaurants  with a Michelin star  and he got all the ones with the word "bucket" in it.  Okay, honey, BRB, I'm gonna go powder the inside of my nose.  [TRACKER APP BEEPING]  Wait, why is oh, no.  Hello, my sweet churrito. I found you.  What are you doing here? I thought you were working.  Well, Jack, I couldn't miss your birthday.  So I asked Silvio to work my Paris/Hong Kong,  Hong Kong/Sydney, Sydney/Fiji, Fiji/Dallas,  Dallas/Des Moines, Des Moines/LaGuardia leg.  And in return, I will work his Trenton to Cincinnati  Cincinnati to Trenton, Trenton to Cincinnati.  Wait, why are there two plates here?  Oh, uh, because every birthday  I set a plate for Cher.  One day she will come back to me.  You have to believe.  Oh, wait, on second thought,  Cher won't like the lighting there.  Yeah, she likes it [AS CHER] dark-lit, oh.  And I looked out at the class and I realized,  wow, I really am changing these student's lives.  That's when I knew teaching was for me.  So you didn't know you wanted to teach  until you were already doing it?  What I meant was that was the moment it solidified.  So it was more of an afterthought than a calling  like it is for so many of us.  I wouldn't say it was never a calling.  You know who never came a-calling?  Will's dog, Belvedere.  Go.  I don't think this is the time  Left the door open. Cement truck. Splat.  Never saw it coming.  Belvedere.  Can you bring me a couple of menus for that table?  I'll be sitting at both.  Long story, but the two people I'm dining  with can't know the other one is here.  They'd hate each other. I know, it's so clichÃ©.  You don't remember me, do you?  Oh, of course I do.  Give me a clue.  I'm Rex. We went out last year.  Little more.  We slept together.  You said you'd call and you never did.  Yeah, I'm gonna need a little more than that.  We went to my parent's house for Christmas.  Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.  Would you ever forgive me, Johnny?  I already said my name was Rex.  Yeah, I'm in the middle of a thing, Johnny.  Sorry, can't talk right now.  I think what she's trying to say is that through adversity  I've learned that what I really want to do  is make a difference in people's lives.  You know where else Will felt different?  Tell him about the chin-up contest in the red jazz shoes.  Grace.  As an African-American man, I can appreciate  you've had obstacles to overcome  like doing chin-ups in red shoes.  [PHONE CHIMES]  Excuse me, this is my wife.  What the hell are you doing?  I am trying to help you make a good impression.  Oh, right, because who better to teach contract law  than a guy who kills dogs and wears Capezios.  I know, I could pull out one of your nose hairs.  Good luck finding one.  And no, I am not going to cry, Grace.  I can turn this around. I just need more time with him.  [THUDDING]  - Professor Rice? - Oh, my God.  Are you okay?  I don't know if he's breathing. Check his pulse.  Go, do it!  Will. I think he's dead.  Oh, no.  [GASPS]  You Belvedere'd him.  Honey, sorry it took me so long.  A woman was choking in the bathroom.  Took me forever to get around her.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, don't sit there, don't sit there.  You'd be sitting next to  a table full of office gals sharing appetizers.  Ugh, the worst.  [MOCKING] It's wine-o-clock.  Happy hump day.  Oh, honey, I'm so glad it's just the two of us.  And I am also so glad it's just the two of us  because why would there be more than two?  Who would that third person even be?  I've gotta pee.  Thank you.  Okay, the ambulance is on its way.  I can't believe this is happening.  I know. Wait, wait, wait, what about his wife?  We have to call her. Get his phone from inside his jacket.  Ew, no. Why should I do it?  Your fingerprints are all over him.  Why drag me down with you?  I don't have a motive, you do.  Ugh, I can't believe a man just died in our apartment.  You see, that kind of emotion  could have been a little helpful a little earlier.  I am so happy that it's just the two of us tonight.  And I am also so glad it's just the two of us tonight  because why would there be more than two?  I mean, who would that third person even be?  [LAUGHING]  You have to pee.  I do? I do.  I'll lift up his jacket and you grab it with the ice tongs.  - Ugh, so creepy, so creepy - Ugh, I hate this  - I hate this, I hate this. - So creepy.  - Okay, I got it. I got it. - [PHONE CHIRPS]  [SCREAMING]  Dead guy's phone.  Okay, sorry, I'm having such a good time tonight  and I hope it never ends.  Should I call us a Lyft?  What? No, it's present time.  I didn't have time to wrap it,  so I just stuffed it between my boobs.  Oh, okay.  [GASPING]  Off the rack. Wow.  Oh, Karen, I love it. Thank you so much.  This one tells the minutes, but this one  Karen, I know how to tell time.  Wait, where are Mickey's gloves?  Oh, there's a text.  "Henry, what's your decision on Will Truman?"  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  - Grace, we can't. - But we could.  - You're insane. - And he's dead.  So we could.  - Grace. - Okay, look, look.  All we have to do is reply with a text  saying that he recommends you for the job.  We can't.  Can we?  Oh, thank you, lover.  I had not relieved myself since Dubai.  So before you open your present okay.  It's an ascot.  You can imagine it is my small silken hands  caressing your neck and gently choking you.  I love it, I love it.  I'm gonna go walk around see how it catches the light.  BOTH:  Happy birthday to you   [SHUSHING] Not now!  BOTH:  Happy birthday to you   ALL:  Happy birthday, dear Jack   What part of "shh" do you not understand?  Honey, your cake is here.  Chorizo, your cake is here.  [GASPS]  Her.  Her.  Okay, send the text, put the phone back,  and then we'll go back to being people  who don't do things to dead people.  It's locked.  We need his thumb to open it.  - Okay, fine. - Where are you going?  To get the kitchen shears.  Five seconds ago, you wouldn't touch a dead body.  Now you want to dismember him?  Just the thumb.  Ugh.  Damn it, it only unlocks with a retina scan.  We couldn't. That crosses a line.  Will, we're going to hell. It doesn't matter what level.  You pry open his eyelid.  I'll press the phone to his face.  I've got a better idea.  You want me to get the melon baller?  No, Hannibal. You pry open his eye.  - Oh, man up, Mary. - Okay, okay.  [GROANS, PHONE CHIRPS]  Got it. I'm in.  - "It's a yes on Will Truman." - Perfect.  "And let's donate to Grace Adler's campaign."  Did you actually just type that?  No, it's called gallows humor, Will.  Delete, delete, delete, delete.  Ambulance will be here soon. Poor guy.  At least one good thing will come out of this.  - You get to keep your promotion. - Yeah, that's true.  And then we can just put this whole nightmare behind  Ahh! [SCREAMING]  You're alive.  Oh, no, did I pass out? It happens sometimes.  My blood pressure drops dangerously low and  I'm fine.  Little embarrassed, but I'm fine.  I just need to splash cold water on my face.  - You realize what this means? - Yes.  We just witnessed a man coming back from the dead.  He was never dead.  Then I don't realize what this means.  My phone  - Oh. - [GROANS]  [JAZZ MUSIC]  You didn't tell me your Mexican jumping queen  was gonna be here.  And you did not tell me you invited this withered wino.  Tapas-whoseabottomus.  Gin mummy.  Okay, enough, you guys. Enough.  Stop it. Sit down.  Sit!  It is my birthday.  Can't you just get along for me?  Damn it, I should have wished that.  But I do want to be invisible.  No, I said it out loud!  That's why you can see me.  The point is, I want you two to stop acting like children.  She's the one who started it.  Shut your paella-hole, sky waitress.  [GASPS] I will not, you hag.  There is only one person who is allowed to call me a hag  and you certainly don't look like Madeleine Albright.  [GRUNTS]  You can't be doing this.  Neither of you is wearing waterproof mascara.  You're going down, chimichanga.  You guys, people are starting to notice.  I got you, Karen. I got you.  I'm sorry, the three of you are going to have  to get out of the lily pond.  But there's only two people in the lily pond.  You checked his pulse. You said he was dead.  I did the thing they do on "SVU."  I picked up his wrist and I said, "He's dead."  He's gonna know we used his phone.  What am I going to do?  Okay, okay, okay.  How about we accuse him of doing exactly what we did  to confuse him? It works in politics.  That's the dumbest idea I ever heard.  Did you send a text from my phone  when you thought I was dead?  No, you sent a text from our phones  when you thought we were dead.  What?  There was a text on my phone that I did not send,  offering a full-time position to you  and a campaign contribution to you.  If you donate more than $50, you get a free tote.  - I know this looks bad. - Wait.  How did you bypass the optical scanner?  Oh, my God. Did you pull back my eyelid?  Yes, I did. I did. And and I know that's bad.  That was bad.  But in Will's defense  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Will.  That's how far I'd go to keep this job.  I see.  You're fired, obviously.  Good night.  Uh, Professor Rice, just wait.  Look, for for what it's worth  I've felt more in love with the law  these last few months teaching  than I-I did in 20 years as a practicing lawyer.  And I that's more personal, I guess, than I realized.  I wouldn't do it if I didn't passionately believe  that it was the right thing to do.  Are you crying?  No, I'm sorry. I just, it's, uh  It means a lot to me.  I didn't realize you felt so deeply, Truman.  I've got to admit, I thought you were  Uptight and robotic?  I wasn't going to use either of those words.  Others have, but go on.  I guess I was wrong about you.  It seems you do care about teaching.  All right, Truman.  Maybe I'm still a little lightheaded,  but I'm willing to give you a second chance.  Thank you, professor. I will not disappoint you.  Don't.  And in return, I trust you will be discreet  about my little incident.  What little incident?  Oh, he's talking about when he passed out  and then we thought that oh.  I'll see you tomorrow. Jazz shoes optional.  Nice fake tears.  I told you it would work.  Yeah, pretending to cry was a great idea.  [SNIFFS]  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Aren't you glad we didn't melon ball his eyes out?  I'm sorry, Jack.  Yeah.  He's sorry.  [HISSING]  Stop it!  Do you realize how much this fighting hurts me?  Si.  And how does that make you feel?  Sorry.  And if Karen hadn't paid them off,  what do you think the restaurant would have done?  Sue.  Exactly. Now I'm going to talk to Karen.  You go in there and make yourself look pretty.  I wanna live stream.  Come on, Karen.  You're not mad at that whole hag thing.  - What's going on? - Nothing.  Go flip your Spanish omelet.  Stop it. It's my birthday.  Yeah, well, now you've got someone else  to share your birthdays with.  O  M  God.  You're afraid of losing me.  I ain't afraid of nothing.  Okay. I guess I'm wrong.  I need you in my life.  Karen.  Me getting married isn't going to ruin anything between us.  - It will. - It won't.  You're not losing a homo.  You're gaining a homo.  You know, you're right.  Now I'll have one to play with when you're in the wash.  Okay, all right, honey.  You got someone waiting for you.  I'll see you later.  Oh, wait, Karen.

                    			1 "Will & Grace" was recorded in front  - of a live studio audience. - [ELEVATOR DINGS]  Ugh, I can't believe how full I am.  This food baby's daddy better make an honest woman out of me.  I've never felt so bloated in my life.  A little less bloated now than you were when you got on the elevator.  That wasn't me. That was Karen's dog.  - How dare you. - [DOG GROWLS]  Shu Shu Fontana is a woman of quality.  She only lets it rip in the staff quarters.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   Why is there a paused video  of a man playing a ukulele on here?  Is it possible your taste in porn has gotten even sadder?  It's a YouTube tutorial.  I'm starting a new semester tomorrow.  I wanna spice it up a little, connect with the kids.  By playing ukulele?  Aren't you worried they might think you're a little too cool?  I'm doing it ironically,  but also kind of unironically.  It's post-ironic, you know what I mean?  Do you know what you mean?  He's freaking out because he got a couple  of negative comments on his faculty profile.  I'm not freaking out,  and we are not gonna read them aloud.  "Always prepared and responsible,  but lacked spontaneity."  Huh.  That sounds exactly like your Grindr profile.  Better than "STD-free for 14 days."  I wish.  Low marks for fun and accessibility.  That's not me.  That's just because legal ethics is so dry.  Ooh, you know what you should do to spice things up?  Make it like Judge Judy.  I should make my law class  at Columbia Law School like Judge Judy?  I'm not gonna stoop to some lame classroom stunt  just so my students will like me more.  Like playing a sad, tiny guitar?  How about you don't tell me how to do my job,  and I won't tell you how to watch videos all day  - with your mouth open. - [UKULELE STRUMS]  Uh, I have a part-time job  which I forgot to go to today.  Oh, well [CHUCKLES]  I'm gonna put this cannoli in the refrigerator  - unless you want it. - Oh, I'm stuffed.  - You go ahead. - Oh, God.  I couldn't eat another bite. Please.  Oh, well, if you insist.  [PANTS RIPPING]  What was that?  Somebody's pants just ripped.  - I'm scared to look. - Me too.  We could check each other's.  It was you.  It was also you.  - And you ripped your underwear. - I'm not wearing underwear.  Oh, God!  And that's the   Sylla bus   [UKULELE STRUMS GENTLY]  And that is just a taste of some of the fun  we're gonna have in class this semester  spontaneous fun.  I didn't even know this ukulele was here  [CHUCKLES]  All right, look [STAMMERS, SIGHS]  I know the ins and outs of Advanced Torts  can be a bit of a snooze, but I've got two words.  I'm gonna wake you guys up.  "Mock Trial."  Huh?  I got I got three more words for you.  We're gonna do that mock trial  Judge Judy-style.  - [STUDENTS CHATTERING] - Right?  - Right? - [BELL RINGS]  Hey, hey, your assignment for next week is to come up with  a compelling tort that we can really sink our teeth into  a savory tort, if you will.  [LAUGHS]  Get out of here, you nuts.  - Sorry, I'm leaving. - Oh, no rush.  Good first day, huh?  What'd you think of the ukulele,  or as they pronounce it in Hawaii,  "ooh-ku-le-le."  You know me, by the way.  I sort of recognize you. Help me out.  Picture me this tall standing next to a drunk woman  who's having two maids arm wrestle for their dinner.  You're Karen's stepdaughter!  Oh, my God, Olivia. Wow, it's nice to see you.  Nice to see you too [CHUCKLES]  But Karen's not in my life anymore.  Said with love she's dead to me.  I'm cool with it I mean,  as cool as I can be about something that's not cool.  Okay, okay, well, we don't have to talk about it.  Let's just have a good semester together.  Yeah, sure.  So, how is she?  I mean, does she still sleep in a casket  and live off the blood of villagers?  It really wouldn't be appropriate  for me to answer that question, but yes.  I shouldn't have said that.  It's misogynistic to refer to women as monsters  or associated with the occult.  I should've just called her a bitch.  I'll tell her you said hi.  [BELL RINGS]  Okay.  Are we sure we wanna do this?  Have my naked body critiqued by a bitchy gay guy?  It's like every date I ever went on in college.  I can handle it.  Fair enough, though I should warn you  I always have a gentleman's boner in case of emergencies.  Good to know. Open wide.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  You have less body hair than I do.  [SCOFFS] Forget it. I'm not doing this.  - Jack - Me shy.  Jack, you're getting married in a couple of months.  You're gonna be in a room full of gay men  who are only there to gossip about how bad you look.  Ugh, why did I invite my closest friends?  And you need to be skinny because?  I'm a woman who's alive.    [MELLOW PIANO MUSIC]  Hey. Grace here?  And who may I say is calling?  Just tell her I got all the diet books that she wanted,  except for "Bleed the Weight Out,"  which was pulled for being medically unsafe.  That's not a real martini, is it?  She's a dog, Will.  It's a gimlet.  What kind of mother do you think I am?  Based on that, a delusional one.  Okay.  You know, I wasn't gonna bring it up,  but I had my first torts class today,  and Olivia was there.  - Olivia? - Yeah.  Why didn't you tell me she was at Columbia?  Because I didn't know.  We're not speaking.  She refuses to give me back my black heart.  Pretty sure you've still got that.  I am talking about  my heart-shaped black diamond necklace.  After the divorce, I realized that she still had it,  and now she won't give it back.  So, what do you wear on Casual Fridays?  My grandmother gave that necklace to my mother.  My mother gave it to me, and one day,  I am going to give it to Shu Shu.  You're my only daughter, and I couldn't be happier.  Answer your mother when she speaks to you.  Uh  sorry if I struck a nerve.  Just tell Grace that I dropped the books off.  And you are?    - Hey, lady. - Hi.  Mind if I join you?  I'm having my mid-morning snack.  Ooh, whatcha having?  It is a carrot dipped in soda water.  - I call it carrot fizz. - Oh.  It's really satisfying  if you eat a roll of toilet paper first.  You know, this whole dieting thing  - isn't as hard as I thought. - I know, right?  So, what did you have for breakfast?  Um, I swallowed my gum and watched "Chef's Table."  It was great, and I'm totally satisfied.  I don't miss eating either.  For breakfast, I had half a grapefruit  and a few of those leaves  left at the bottom of a bag of grapefruit.  Oh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are those?  Oh, I could put a couple of croutons in my salad.  Um, no, you can't.  Those croutons are going right to your "bouton."  You're right. Why sabotage myself?  I am throwing them away.  - Thank you. - You're welcome.  Oh, I think you spilled a little bit of your carrot fizz.  Grace, no! No!  Please! Please! It wants to eat!  We're never gonna change if we cheat.  [WHIMPERING]  No! Jack, no!  I ju I'd give anything for a piece of stale bread!  I don't get to cheat, you don't get to cheat.  Fine  [HUFFS]  Hey, how about this?  We each take a lick.  [EXHALES]  Just to get the taste, the soul of the crouton.  Yes! And then we throw it away.  And there's no calories gained.  But all the joy and satisfaction.  - I like it! - Okay, good.  - Okay, ready? - Ready.  - Lick on three. - Okay.  One, two, three.  - [CROUTONS CLINKING] - BOTH: Oh.  [SIGHS]  - That was really satisfying. - Oh, yeah.  Although, I don't think I got the right mix  of herb and cheese.  Should we maybe do another one?  We have to. Okay.  - On three. - Yeah.  One, two, three.  [CROUTONS CLINKING]  BOTH: [SIGHS]  [CROUTONS CLINKING]  We're missing a clink.  [BOWL CLINKS]  [MUFFLED] There it is.  - You ate one. - Not yet.  Release it! Drop it, drop it!  - [GROWLS] - Drop it!  What is the matter with you?  It was one crouton!  I thought you were stronger than that, Grace.  Have a little self-restraint!  Now look what you made me do.  Why am I so weak, and more importantly,  why didn't we play that game with egg rolls?  Jack! Jack!  No, no!  I'm weak too, Grace.  I'm weak, fat, and lazy!  I'm America!    [BEETHOVEN'S "SYMPHONY NO. 5" PLAYING ON PHONE]  Thank you, bailiff.  Hello, everyone. Welcome to my courtroom.  And remember,  don't give me beef jerky and expect me to blow bubbles.  [CHUCKLES]  Guys, it's okay to laugh at the Judy-isms.  Sorry, Heschel.  I should've said "Judge Judy-isms."  Okay, okay, okay, so, I wanna be home  eating my soup, in my slippers by 3:30.  Let's hear what cases you've come up with.  Come on, you guys.  This isn't gonna be fun  unless we come up with something really juicy.  Oh, I've got a case that's got the word "juicy"  written all over it, in capital letters  like the ass on an easy girl's sweatpants.  Are you seriously here right now?  You stole my necklace.  I didn't steal anything. You gave me that necklace.  I lent you that necklace.  You gave it to me, but you were probably too busy  yelling at maids and giving up on your marriage to remember.  I was never too busy  to yell at a maid.  Ladies and gentlemen, I think we've found our case.  [PENSIVE PIANO MUSIC]    Wow, just one week of starving ourselves  and taking the stairs, and I feel like a whole new  man.  I'm getting used to the lightheadedness.  It's kind of like being stoned,  but with none of the laughing, or snacking, or joy.  It'll all be worth it at the weigh-in.  Remember, if we each lost at least two pounds,  we get to stand outside of McDonald's  and take three deep breaths.  This has been a tough week, but we got through it.  - Yeah. - I'm really proud of us, Jack.  - I'm proud of us too. - [WHIMPERS]  [ELEVATOR DINGS]  Hi, we're raising money for our school choir.  Would you like to buy a candy bar?  Would you like to never see your families again?  You may have ruined your mother's body,  but you're not gonna ruin mine.  - We're doing great. - I'm not even hungry.  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  Court is in session.  Today's case Walker v. Walker.  The plaintiff claims defendant stole a diamond necklace.  Defendant, how do you respond?  I didn't steal it. She gave it to me.  I remember because when I told Rosario, she said,  "That doesn't sound like your drunken witch of a stepmother."  Exactly, she knew it was out of character for me.  Judge, I'd like to call Rosario to the stand.  Rosario's dead.  Oh, that one's always got an excuse.  I would like to bring to the court's attention that  she doesn't even know who's dead or not.  I let you borrow that necklace  because I was being nice like I always was.  - Objection. - Sustained.  Oh.  Based on what?  I know you.  I was nice!  What about the time you grounded me for drinking?  - A lot of parents do that. - For not drinking enough?  What kind of sixth grader can't finish a shot?  I mean, Jagermeister? It's practically like candy.  I give it out for Halloween.  You're both mixing up  your personal issues with the legal one.  Now, defendant, it sounds like there was an expectation  that the necklace would be returned.  Don't get your foot caught in the escalator  and expect me to take the stairs.  Good one, sir.  I'm not giving it back.  Do you see how spiteful she is?  Rotten kid.  She probably doesn't even know where it is anymore.  - I know where it is. - No, you don't.  - I do, too. - Then where is it?  None of your business.  Defendant, answer the question.  Where's the necklace?  I'm wearing it.  Well, I must be flying a kite in the rain,  'cause this just got electric.    [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  She stole my necklace.  I demand biblical justice.  Cut off her hair.  She's trying to take back something she already gave me,  which used to be called Indian giving,  but has yet to be given a new culturally-acceptable name.  The property law in question here is pretty black and white.  I've had this necklace since high school.  She could've asked for it back anytime.  She's doing it now for spite.  That might be true, but again,  it's not a legal argument.  I'm sorry, Olivia,  but I'm gonna have to find in favor of Karen.  It's been in her family for generations,  and it was a gift from her mother.  And I thought it was a gift from my mother.  - What did you just say? - Nothing.  - Did you just call me - Just forget it, okay?  Fine. It's forgotten.  So, is class over, or  No, it is not over. Screw this.  Look, look, yes, the law is black and white,  but emotions are not.  People are complicated.  Now, we pretend to be motivated by one thing,  when really, it's something much more personal like me.  I mean, this whole Judge Judy thing  I only did it because  my feelings got hurt by a few negative reviews.  Bet none you knew that.  I'm pretty sure everybody knew that.  The point is, James, sometimes,  if you get to the bottom of an emotional conflict,  the legal dispute takes care of itself.  Olivia, I've known you since you were a child,  and Karen, you're my friend for 20 years.  This isn't about a necklace. Talk to each other.  - I don't wanna! - She started it.  Come on.  I can see you wanna be in each other's lives.  Now, there's a source for this hurt between you.  What is it?  She never called me after she found out about the divorce.  She cut me out of her life completely,  blamed me for everything.  That's not true.  I know you and my dad were both at fault.  And maybe I should've been the bigger person,  but isn't that the parent's job?  Why didn't you call me?  I dropped my phone in the toilet.  Battery got wet. It was a whole thing.  Karen.  I was scared, okay?  And what do you wanna say to each other now?  Do you really think of me as your mother?  Our real mom died when I was so young,  and our house was the saddest place in the world.  And then you came, and you were so glamorous  and full of life,  and vodka.  It was like that part was finally over.  Honey, I never knew you felt that way.  I always wanted to be with you.  - I wanted to be you. - Aww.  Listen, I wanna give you something.  It's a little bit of a tradition in our family  between mothers and daughters.  [WHISPERS] I bet it's the necklace.  Now, I'm gonna tell you the same thing  my mother told me when she gave it to me.  Shove it up your butt till we get through customs.    - Moment of truth. - [SIGHS]  Yep [LAUGHS SOFTLY]  Should we try to pee again real quick?  Nothing came out the last three times we tried, okay?  It's tapped. It's just foam and air.  - Now, get up there. - Okay, fine, fine, fine.  But I am subtracting six pounds for clothes,  shoes, and my weenus.  All right, then I'm subtracting  seven pounds for my bra and my feelings.  Get up there.  Get up there!  You've lost 180 pounds.  - I've been good all week, so - Back.  I can't do it, Grace.  Why do I always have to be the man?  Because of your hands.  Do you know how much time I have spent  negotiating with God in front of this thing?  [SIGHS] I hate you.  You have ruined so many womens' lives.  Gay men too, you son of a bitch!  Why do we do this to ourselves?  I mean, we're both healthy-ish.  We both have guys who think we're hot-ish  the way we are.  Why can't we just give ourselves permission  to be happy-ish?  Yes.  Yeah, we're we're not that bad.  I mean, we may not be Fashion Week skinny,  but we're definitely Disneyland skinny.  I think we could just go a little easier on ourselves.  Yeah, you're right. Yeah.  No one our age can eat like they used to.  [DOOR CLICKS]  Hey.  Those adorable twins from the fourth floor  were selling candy bars in the lobby.  [GROANS] I lost three pounds.  I  No matter what I do, I can't gain weight.  Maybe I should eat this, you know,  in case I need smaller jeans [CHUCKLES]  What's going on? What  why do you have a gentleman's boner?     
                




                    			1 "Will & Grace" is shot before a live studio audience.  This is exciting.  You and me, biking to work together.  Why didn't we do this sooner?  Well, A: We've never worked near each other before.  And B: You're afraid of  the truth-revealing properties of Spandex.  Speaking of which, what do you have in your bike shorts?  You've been dying to ask that for 30 years.  I packed a banana for later.  But guess what?  I'm hungry now.  You want a peach?  It's quite the fruit basket you've got there.  You know the best part about teaching?  I can ride my bike to work,  'cause I don't have to get all dressed up.  Or is the best part that you're in a position of power  and there's all these hot, young guys around  and if you ask them out they have to say yes  or you'd fail them?  You do understand the difference between  a law school and a porno set in a law school, right?  Come on, there isn't one teacher you wouldn't mind  swapping briefs with?  Well, there's this one guy Paul,  teaches civil procedure.  He's been kind of giving me a vibe lately.  Okay, okay, so he's a chubby chaser, that's good.  No, hooking up with a coworker?  - It's frowned upon. - It's frowned upon?  Heavens no.  Stop playing it so safe.  You're in your early hundreds.  - Take a risk for once. - I take risks.  He is pretty cute. Maybe you're right.  Have I ever been wrong?  Except always, almost never.  Exactly.  - Shall we? - We shall.  [FOOTSTEPS CLACKING]  [FOOTSTEPS CLACK]  [FOOTSTEPS CLACKING]  [RHYTHMIC CLACKING]  - Six, seven, now. - [FOOTSTEPS CLACKING]  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   Look, Melania, I really appreciate  you thinking of me,  and this guy sounds great, but  I'm not ready to start dating.  I just got a divorce, and  No, it's super easy.  You just have to sign a few papers.  Yeah, yeah, I'll shoot you his info.  Okay.  - Be best, girl. - [PHONE BEEPS]  That was your First Lady trying to fix me up again.  Not sure we really trust her taste in men.  Like she had a choice.  Maybe you should think about getting back out there.  - I'm not ready. - Who is?  Do you think I was ready the first time I had sex  after Leo and I divorced?  Oh, huh, how about that?  Only took 45 seconds to make it about you.  I am not making it about me.  So I was with this guy,  and I shouted out "Leo!" in bed,  so I had to pretend that I was telling him my astrological sign  but his was Cancer, so he shouts out "Cancer!"  - [LAUGHS] - [SNORTS, LAUGHS]  [SIGHS]  Wait, what were we talking about?  - Me. - Oh, that's right.  Look, all I'm trying to say is that  I thought I would never be ready,  but I forced myself to get back on the horse.  I would like to ride a horse again.  Mm-hmm.  Stan was never allowed,  for animal safety reasons.  You know what? I will go out with this guy.  And thank you, Grace.  I don't want to end up like you.  But I never said  You're welcome.  [ELEVATOR DINGS]  Ooh! My new fabric from Istanbul!  Oh, thank you, Richard.  Or would you prefer "Rich"?  I prefer "Steve," because that's my name.  Fair enough.  [SOFT LAUGH]  Okay.  [EXHALES] Thank God that's over.  I believe this is yours.  Malcolm, what are you doing here?  And why did you come in a FedEx box?  'Cause I absolutely positively had to get here overnight.  Where's Karen?  Actually, she's on a date.  She got back on the horse and I'm proud of her.  Me too.  I know she couldn't ride with Stan  because of animal safety issues.  [GROANS] I have to see her, Grace.  For the last five months, she's all I've thought about.  I could barely waterboard my target in Bahrain  because his screams reminded me of our lovemaking.  Wait a minute, that's torture.  You have no idea.    [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  [ELEVATOR DINGS]  [DOG YAPS]  Morning, bitches.  Jack McFarland.  You don't remember me, do you?  You remember my sister Zandra. She was your acting teacher.  And I used to sub for her whenever she fell prey to  the tragic personal demons,  and also when she played Old Whore in "One Life to Live."  Zusanna?  She never saw the potential in you that I saw.  I told her, "Jack has that something  "that's rare and precious in an actor:  His checks always clear."  Ha-ha!  "Zusanna's Dog Walking Service?"  Wait, so you're not teaching anymore?  Teaching? No.  It robbed me of all my creative energy.  Teaching is for no-talent hacks.  What are you doing with yourself?  So I'm a teacher.  Kind of half-teacher, half-actor, you know.  But I still get health and dental.  Does Tom Cruise have dental?  No, but he's such a good actor you believe he has teeth.  You can't be half an actor, Jack!  What's "hoff-en-octa-jock"?  Precisely.  You must commit to your craft!  All right, I'll do it!  I'll temporarily unretire and I'll teach you again.  - Really? - [LAUGHING] Yeah.  I haven't had an acting teacher  since I got kicked out of my online master class  with Manny from "Modern Family."  Well, I will drop by the rec center later,  and we will embark on our journey together.  My sister Zandra said that teaching you  was like trying to teach a donkey to curtsey.  But I will consider it an honor.  Hey, how is Zandra, by the way?  She's no longer with us.  She was cleaning her gun,  and she accidentally fell out the window.  Then six months later, she had a heart attack and died.  [BREATHING HEAVILY]  She she's gone?  Oh, my God, Zandra.  [INHALES SHARPLY]  [SHRIEKING] Zandra!  [DOGS BARK]  [CRYING] Why?  [TEARFUL MUTTERING]  Oh, wait, I knew that.    Hey, Paul, you teaching today?  Actually, they, uh, moved my class right next door,  so looks like we're neighbors.  Ohh, the gays are taking over the hood.  All right, well, let me know if you need anything  from the boy next door.  - Uh, Paul, you - Yeah?  - Want to grab a drink sometime? - Sure.  Wow, I just, uh I did not expect that from you.  You kind of seem like a "rule" guy.  [SCOFFS] That was a different Will Truman.  That guy's got a real stick up his ass.  Well, does this Will Truman have a problem with  faculty dating being frowned upon?  Frowned upon? Please.  Who cares? Not this guy.    Hey. How was the date?  I don't want to talk about it.  All right, quit pestering me! I'll tell you!  - He stood me up. - Oh, Karen.  I am done. I have had two loves in my life.  One divorced me, the other caused the divorce.  That is it.  - I saw Malcolm. - What?  He wants to give it another shot.  Maybe you should think about it.  Absolutely not.  That man ruined my life.  Okay, okay, look, Karen,  can I just give you 30 seconds of tough love?  Fine.  But no car antennas and stay away from the face.  No! No, Karen.  What  People in healthy relationships don't cheat.    [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  Now, let's explore fear.  Show me a man who's afraid of heights.  Yes, yes, now show me a man  who's afraid of losing his lover.  No, he's still afraid of heights.  Show me a man who's afraid of birds!  - Birds? - Of birds!  He's afraid of losing his lover. Now he's afraid of heights.  He's afraid of birds.  He's afraid of birds with his lover.  He's afraid of his lover on the heights with the birds!  Now he's afraid of his lover!  Lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover.  Lover now stop.  Now what if I asked you to show me a man  who's biggest fear is that he won't make it as an actor?  A man who's taken a safe job  so he doesn't have to risk everything as an artist.  What would that look like?  It would it would look like me.  That's right, a true artist doesn't have a safety net.  You have to ask yourself, "Am I a teacher?  Or am I an actor?"  - I'm an actor. - What?  - I'm an actor. - I don't believe you.  Hi, Mr. McFarland.  Mr. McFarland is dead, Felix!  He was your teacher. I am an actor and only an actor!  And from this day forward, I am "Just Jack."    - Hey. - You ready?  - Definitely. - Oh, good.  I was, uh, kind of worried you were gonna bail.  Crossed my mind for a second.  But they say when you're on your deathbed,  it's not the things you did that you regret  but the things you didn't do.  And I don't want this to be something that I didn't do.  I am flattered that I am the thing that you want to do.  [SOFT CHUCKLE] Let's get out of here.  You read my mind.  - There you are. - Oh, Liam.  - Uh, hey. - Hi.  [KISSES] I was looking for you all over.  Oh, yeah, uh, they moved my class.  Wait, I thought you had dinner with your sister?  She cancelled, then Iris called  to say she couldn't sit.  - Everything at once. - Oh.  Hi, I'm Liam, Paul's husband.  Will Truman. [SOFT CHUCKLE]  Didn't tell me you had a child. [CHUCKLES]  I lost Lucy's bunny. I need the backup bunny.  Oh, it's, uh, it's in my bag.  She's an angel.  Would you like to hold her, Will?  Definitely.  Uh, we will be right back.  I didn't mean to bother you at work.  No-no-no, don't worry about it.  Don't look at me like that. I didn't do anything.  - [BABY WHINING] - Okay, yes.  I I agreed to meet with him.  So I'm complicit. You raise a good point.  But, um, you know, I'm not breaking any laws.  Which is a weak defense  with the word "ethics" written behind you  Fell right into your trap. Hm.  [SIGHS] Hope I never have to face you in court.  You're relentless.  Thank you, Will.  Oh, oh, sure. She's a sweetie.  Okay then.  - I'll see you at home later? - Okay.  - I love you. - Mm, I love you too.  Well, that was awkward.  - You think? - [SOFT CHUCKLE]  You guys have an arrangement or?  Uh, yeah, if I get caught, he arranges my murder.  - Drink? - No!  You have a husband and a baby.  And not just any husband and a baby  but a husband who clearly loves you  and a baby who arguably has the greatest legal mind  of any baby in our time.  I thought you said that you were a risk-taker.  Well, I'm not.  I'm a classic rule-follower.  That's why I like the law. It's all about the rules.  Come on, you know it's different with two guys.  - We make our own rules. - No, we don't.  I don't.  You know, we spend all these years  saying marriage is marriage  and love is love till we were blue in the face.  And now that we finally have what we were fighting for,  we say cheating is not always cheating?  I mean, that just seems like cheating.  Sorry, Paul, I [SIGHS]  See you around the hood.  [SCHOOL BELL RINGS]  Oh, damn it.    [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  What is he doing here?  She didn't specify where I had to be  at the time the call took place.  I will talk to you or be in the same room with you,  but I will not do both.  - Fine. - Fine.  And I have gotten zero done today,  so I will be in my office.  Grace, wait. Please stay.  Karen and I have a long history of using a middleman  to overcome obstacles.  In 2017, when we couldn't touch,  we both kissed Smitty.  In 2012, when we promised not to see each other anymore,  we had virtual sex as orcs in "World of Warcraft."  When we cut off all communication in 2007,  I gave her a shout-out by ghostwriting the song  "Promiscuous" by Nelly Furtado featuring Timbaland.  Be our middleman, Grace.  It could work, because in the middle,  you resemble a man.  Fine.  [SIGHS]  - You want me to say that? - Yeah.  "Karen, I can't stop thinking about  "your sweet, sweet lady-nest.  It is the only place I truly feel home."  - No, I'm not saying that. - [YAPS]  "And I have thought, once or twice,  "about your skin missile  "And your targeted carpet bombing  "and the things you let me do to you  that no man has ever let me do before."  "Like what?"  Wait what am I doing? Enough!  How are you two even alive?  Why don't the two of you just make up already?  He told Stan about our affair.  When you cut me out of your life,  I felt like I was drowning.  And I love you desperately, Karen,  like Mark Antony loved Cleopatra.  He threw away the world for her,  because an empire without her by his side  was a prison.  Oh, Malcolm.  Your words give me feelings in my heart area.  But no.  You ruined my marriage  and I don't think I could ever forget that.  But you could forgive him.  Look, obviously,  on some deeply weird level,  the two of you are meant for each other.  But without forgiveness,  the past never stops hurting.  It stays with you,  like Fergie's performance of the national anthem.  [DOOR OPENS]  [DOOR SHUTS]  Excuse me, miss?  Is this Grace Adler Designs?  Why, yes it is. How can I help you?  Well, I'm looking for a sunny little piece for my apartment  and I think I may have just found it.  Karen Walker.  Malcolm Widmark. [KISSES]  Uh, there's a place around the corner that keeps  a bottle of ChÃ¢teau Lafite Rothschild  at the bar for me.  - Do you drink? - A widdle.  I'd like to get to know you better.  If I'm being too forward,  I truly hope that you'll forgive me.  I forgive you.    Felix!  You are unencumbered by ability and talent.  Go out and take yourself a lover  so you can bring something to this.  Right now, take a lover, a big ole lover.  Go. [GROANS]  I want to see scars!  Zusanna?  Jack, what are you doing here?  I came to ask Theodore for my job back.  I can't lose my dental.  When you slapped me, you knocked a tooth loose.  I swallowed it on my bus ride home.  What are you doing here?  Well, I work here. I'm your replacement.  But you said teaching here  Wait a minute, you manipulated me to steal my job?  Jack, I needed insurance. So I spun a little tale.  I created a conflict between us for the greater purpose.  You know what that's called?  Acting, Jack.  Oh, that's "octing-jock."  Yes, it's you, my boy.  That was your first lesson and you passed with flying colors.  - I did? - Yes.  You faced your fear and you leapt into the unknown.  A man at your age and with your limited talent,  it's the greatest leap I've ever seen.  Oh, Jack.  You know, sometimes I think of you as the son I never had.  - Do you mean that? - Yeah [SOFT GROAN]  I still need money to go to the dentist though.  Well, lucky for you, I know a job opening  that will pay you just enough to keep you out of poverty  but not nearly enough to make you feel secure.    - I have to pee. - [DOGS YAPPING]  I have to I let you pee! I am the alpha!       
                




                    			1 "Will & Grace" is recorded  in front of a live studio audience.  Hey, uh,  I've got something I need to tell you guys  about the wedding.  Oh, boy.  I think you should all be seated.  At my wedding!  What! Whoo!  Okay, I just finished the chart.  Karen and Grace, you'll be up front with your plus ones,  Noah and Malcolm, and Will ooh.  This is a little Awkwafina.  You're way back at the, uh  singles table. [LAUGHS]  I fully intend to bring someone to your wedding.  You do? Who?  - I might find somebody. - [CHUCKLES]  I love that you think that.  Okay, girls and girls, I gotta get out of here.  I got an election to illegally ri  whoops, almost said it out loud.  I'm gonna go call some designers  and drum up votes.  Once again, I find myself  begging gay men to love me.  So you came all the way  down here just to rub it in my face  that I'm at the singles table?  Nobody's rubbing anything in your face,  which is why you're at the singles table.  You're loving this, aren't you?  You get married, me not having anybody.  Absolutely not.  I take no joy in letting you know you're sitting  [LIGHTLY] at the singles table.  You can't even say it without smiling.  Of course I can.  You [SINGSONGY] uh  Are at  [LAUGHING] Singles table.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   Will, our building is on the news.  - [NEWS THEME PLAYS] - What?  Wow, that is our building.  Bird lovers are talking about this nest  on the Upper West Side where an extremely rare  red-tailed hawk awaits the arrival of her chicks.  With temperatures dropping, it's imperative  that those eggs are always kept warm.  That's why mama bird must sit on those eggs at all times.  Otherwise they may not hatch at all.  Thank you, Angela.  And finally it's time for "The Real McCoy."  That's McCoy Whitman. You went out with him.  Yeah, once, but he's just into meaningless hookups  with hot, superficial dumb-dumbs.  So he's a guy.    And that's when I realized  I've been wrong all these years.  This is actually my best side.  That's why I go, "It's time for 'The Real McCoy.'"  See what was the question again?  If you have any brothers or sisters?  Yeah, one brother.  Also a newscaster. Smaller market.  Is he jealous? I'd rather not say.  - He is. - Okay. [COUGHS]  McCoy.  - I like you. - I like you too.  So you don't have to do this.  - Do what? - Impress me.  Convince how successful and attractive you are.  Can't we get past the surface stuff?  I wanna know the real Real McCoy.  Wow.  Nobody ever wants to know what's on the inside.  Well, I do. That stuff matters.  Okay.  Well, it hasn't been easy for me.  Here, let me show you a picture of me in high school.  Maybe you'll see where I'm coming from.  Oh, I get it.  We all had those awkward teen years.  I had zits and braces and  Holy scoliosis! You were gorgeous!  Exactly.  I've always been this good looking.  You'd have called me the wrong name in high school,  and I would have let you.  And this has been rough for you how?  Because this is all people see me as.  They don't want to hear about who I am or what I feel.  But you do.  I knew there was something special about you.  That's why I couldn't stop thinking about you.  And then we're doing a story about that hawk,  and it's on your building. It was like fate.  I knew that I needed to see you again  [CRYING] because you see me.  [SOBBING] You really see me.  [WEEPING] Thank you.  Okay, okay.  [BLOWS THROUGH NOSE LOUDLY]  [SNIFFLES]  Okay, is this what you're looking for?  Sure, but [CLEARS THROAT]  [SIGHS] I'm sorry. I need a minute.  [BREATHING HEAVILY] Oh.  Whoo.  You've peeled back the first layer.  I can't wait to show you the others.    [ELEVATOR DINGS]  - Hello, Grace. - [HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM]  Val, I didn't see you  squeezed in the corner back there.  Why so jumpy?  No reason.  Just things you've said, done, stolen from my garbage.  Oh, yeah. [CHUCKLES]  Well, it turns out my "erratic behavior"  and "violent tendencies" were caused  by a Vitamin B deficiency.  I'm way better now.  Were you given that diagnosis  from a "real doctor"?  Or from "your cat"?  Cats can't be doctors, only nurses.  Besides, that's the old Val.  The new Val just wants to be friends.  Oh, by the way, good luck in the election.  How do you know about that?  Well, years ago when I could only self-soothe  by pretending to be you,  I became a designer  and joined the Guild. Again, old Val.  - So you're a voting member. - Mm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  - Can I count on your vote? - No, I'm still undecided.  New Val really likes  - to think things through. - [ELEVATOR DING]    [UPBEAT JAZZY MUSIC]  [TAPPING RAPIDLY] Val is a voting member?  This is a disaster.  Would it have killed you to be nice to her?  Maybe.  I think she wanted to make me into a Slim Jim.  Damn it, Grace.  Don't you know what's at stake here?  This is the Presidency  of the people who tell people where to hang wallpaper!  [TAPS CLIPBOARD]  So what are we supposed to do?  "We" aren't supposed to do anything.  Mama will take care of this.  So what, you'll talk to her?  [LAUGHS] Oh, I'll talk to her.  Nothing shady or underhanded.  Nothing shady. [CLICKS TONGUE TWICE]  Or underhanded.  Or  [CLICKS TONGUE TWICE]  Underhanded.  Oh, God, this is so hard.  I want to win so much, but at what cost?  Oh, get it together, Grace!  We're so close  I can smell victory!  Fine. Do what you have to do.  But I don't want to know about it.    Hey, um,  I felt really bad about how I acted yesterday,  so I wanted to bring you  your wedding invitation in person.  [MUMBLES]  Thank you.  "Will Truman plus zero."  You had this printed?  [UNEVENLY] It does not make me happy, Will.  And, hey, there's nothing wrong with the singles table.  And you'll be the oldest one.  You can be their leader. Yay!  You know what? I'm not gonna be at that table.  I will be inviting the hottest guy  in New York to be my plus one.  Ugh. Of course you are.  Oh, I've seen this movie.  On the day of the wedding,  he'll suddenly be called back to Canada.  [GUFFAWING]  [COUGHING]  It's McCoy Whitman!  - Hi, Jack. - Yeah, yeah, we're on a date.  But before you go, uh,  McCoy, short notice, but Jack's getting married soon,  and I wondered if you wanted to go with me.  Yeah, I would love to.  But you don't know when it is!  It could be very inconvenient for you.  - I can make it work. - Put me down for a plus one.  How nice.  I guess I'll just put you at the celebrity table  with J.Lo, Cher, and "Teen Wolf" 's Tyler Posey.  Jack, it's your wedding.  It's not like everybody's gonna be looking at my hot plus one  and not the sweaty groom with anxiety farts.  You're loving this, aren't you?  No.  Not at all. [LAUGHS]  - You don't really have to go - [SOBBING]  Okay, McCoy, broadcast face.  [BREATHES DEEPLY]  First you open my heart,  and then you invite me to your best friend's wedding.  This is a huge step for us.  For us? You know, McCoy, I think  - we should just - Let's go to bed, Will.  [SCOFFS]  Okay.    [VOICEMAIL BEEPS]  Hey, McCoy. Sorry I missed you.  I just wanted to say thanks for the flowers  and the champagne  and the fun socks.  I, uh I assume the little stick figure men  holding hands are us.  It's all it's a little much for me.  - And - [KNOCKING AT DOOR]  Uh, just call me.  Okay? We need to talk.  Hey.  I was just leaving you a message.  I know.  I didn't pick up because I knew  I was gonna see you in a second,  and then I get to hear your voice again later.  Aw, that's scary.  [LAUGHING] You're so funny.  And smart and handsome and kind.  - How did I get so lucky? - Not always so nice.  Look, the message I was leaving  No, stop. Look, I'm new to this.  And maybe this is wrong,  but I am feeling so much right now.  I just need to say these words out loud before I burst.  I think I need to say my thing first.  No, Will, I have never said these three words  - to any man before in my life. - Then don't.  - I love you - Please. Please don't.  There it is, there it is.  I love you, Will Truman.  Again, new to this.  Does the other person always take this long to respond?  [JAZZY MUSIC]  [KNOCKING AT DOOR]  Hello, Grace. It's me, Val.  I wasn't sure you'd recognize me in my fancy clothes.  No, I'm just kidding. I knew you'd recognize me.  Wow. Val, you look amazing.  So, um, did Karen talk to you, by any chance?  Yes, she did, and thank you for telling her  to buy me these things so that I would vote for you.  Oh, I didn't tell her to do that.  Oh, when you're lying, you have to go like this  [CLICKS TONGUE TWICE] at the end.  - Yeah, but I'm not lying. - No, like this  "I'm not lying." [CLICKS TONGUE TWICE]  You'll get it.  Okay, well, um, so  do I have your vote?  Sorry, I can't vote for a dirty politician.    Yes, Judith, Will's bringing him to the wedding.  Ugh! Yes, he's cute!  No, you cannot sit at his table!  I'm in a lot of pain, moth hey, buddy.  Sorry, Jack.  It looks like I won't be coming to your wedding after all.  Will dumped me.  Oh.  It's opposite day. [CHUCKLES]  It's my fault. I came on too strong.  I've known him two days,  and I already know his mother's name,  where she lives,  and what her house looks like on Google Earth.  At least you don't know what Kevin Bacon's garbage  smells like. [LAUGHS]  I'm such an idiot.  And I really liked him.  You poor dear boy.  You know, you remind me of a  slightly older version of myself.  You think I'm older than you? 'Cause I was born in  Let's not get caught up in math, kay?  Look, I know what it's like  to fall in love for the first time.  It's like when you first try cotton candy,  and you think, "This is all I want to eat  and I want to eat it all right now!"  And your mom's like, "You're gonna get sick."  And you'll all, [YELLS] "I know my own body, Judith!"  And you end up with blue vomit all over your clothes.  But you got to ease into it, you know?  If you really want to make it work with Will,  let him know you're willing to take it slow.  Why are you helping me?  Kind of got the sense that you're rooting  against us being together.  Whaaat?  Weird.  Will's my best friend,  and you seem like a decent guy,  As much as it kills me to say this  because I'm rooting against you,  he deserves to be happy.  Thanks, Jack.    I have to tell you I'm very disappointed in you, Grace.  I need some air.  Val.  This is just a big misunderstanding, Val.  I mean, we have history.  You hit me in the head with a snow globe,  and that's friendship.  Is that a drone delivering a pizza?  They do that now?  - What are you doing? - I can't let you win, Grace.  The Guild deserves a leader with a moral compass like me.  You can't just show up and run at the last minute.  Article 172 of the bylaws says that I can.  We have bylaws?  Yes, we do, as established in Article 1.  - Good-bye, Grace. - Wait, Val! No!  [BANGING, RATTLES HANDLE]  Val, come on!  Oh. Oh, no.  [SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE]  [WHISPERING] Oh, God. Oh, God.  Oh, God.  [GRUNTS]  Okay, I can do this.  [LENGTHY GASP]  [WAILS]  I can do this.  Just have to get to the window.  And then I'll be on the staircase  that smells like diapers, and I can handle that.  [EXHALING HEAVILY]  [LENGTHY GASP]  Oh, my God.  The hawk. [GASPS]  You're so beautiful.  [HAWK CAWS]  Oh! Oh, no! Come back!  Your babies will freeze if they're left uncovered!  Freezing your eggs should not be an impulse decision!  Who's gonna keep them warm now?  Aw, crap.    Grace, I know you always tell me not to leave  long, rambling messages, but you gotta listen to this one.  I don't know what to do about McCoy.  The guy's way too into me after one date.  You think sleeping with him when he was vulnerable  and in tears was sending a mixed message?  Oh, here he is on the TV.  God, he's pretty.  You know, this isn't a problem. Don't call me back.  So we're left with the question:  With the mother hawk nowhere in sight,  how much longer can the woman squatting over the eggs  continue to keep them warm?  What are you looking at?  This is what a good New Yorker does.  Well, this was bound to happen sooner or later.  Oh, God.  Oh!  I forgot about you.  [LAUGHING] Yeah. Yes.  [HAWK CAWING]  Mama bird, you're back!  Hi!  Look! Look!  I kept them warm for you.  [HAWK CAWING]  What's that look in your eye?  [HAWK CAWING]  No! [SCREAMING]  [JAZZY MUSIC]  - Hello, Karen. - [LAUGHS]  Do you like my new outfit that I bought  with my own money? [CLICKS TONGUE]  I do, and I don't expect  anything in return. [CLICKS TONGUE]  [BOTH LAUGH]  It's so nice to finally play with someone  - who gets the rules. - Yeah!  Okay.  Now, now,  everyone, can I please have your attention?  I have no idea where Grace is, probably in a bar.  Uh  but I don't know for sure, but since she's not here,  I feel compelled to throw my hat into the ring.  Damn you, Article 172! [SIGHS]  And speaking of Grace, what kind of a person  throws a victory party for herself  in her own office for an election  and doesn't even show up?  What's that?  [RASPY VOICE] "A crazy person!"  Sir, sir, that's not fair.  I don't like that one bit.  But I must say that I do agree with you.  It is a little crazy.  Who are you calling crazy?  This wackadoo locked me out on a ledge,  and then I had to sit on hawk eggs  and keep them warm, and I sang to them,  and I loved them in my own way.  [BREATHING SHAKILY]  And then the mommy hawk came back, and did she thank me?  No    Honey, cheer up.  You had to know this was gonna happen.  No, I didn't know I was gonna win.  They knew I was corrupt, and they voted for me anyway.  Honey, they voted for you because you're corrupt.  Where have you been?  You know what? I'm gonna redeem myself.  It'll take a lot of work, but I'm up for the challenge.  Stop moping. You're President of the  Helena Bonham Carter something something.    [KNOCKING AT DOOR]  McCoy?  Look, I know I've been going too fast.  And I know saying "I love you" to someone  you've gone on two dates with is crazy.  I went too far, and I freaked you out.  Jack helped me realize that.  - Jack? - Yeah.  He said that relationships are like cotton candy  and that I shouldn't give up on us.  Jack McFarland?  Yeah.  He's a pretty deep guy.  Jack McFarland, the jumpy ferret-man  who lives across the hall?  Yeah. Look, the truth is,  I've never been in a real relationship before.  I don't really know how to be.  Well, you're doing pretty good right now.  So what do you say? Can we give it another shot?  [CLEARS THROAT] Yeah. I'd like that.  But let's just take it slow.  Okay? Fewer gifts and on-air declarations.  Got it.  So I'll call you.  Where are you going?  I thought you wanted to take it slow?  Let's talk about it tomorrow.  I'm in the mood for cotton candy.       
                




                    			1 "Will & Grace" is recorded  in front of a live studio audience.  [laughing] You won't believe this.  Uh, happy Valentine's Day to you too.  No, I loved that text.  You look so good in those jeans.  [chuckles] Okay, bye.  - Your mom? - No.  It was McCoy.  And he sent you flowers?  Oh, no, those are from my mom.  Oh. Okay, okay, buckle up.  Noah is Sylvia De La Croix.  What?  You're kidding me.  That is completely blowing  But I don't know who that is.  What?  No, no, no, she's the writer of those trashy romance novels,  "The Bodice Chronicles".  He's her. Noah is Sylvia.  - Noah writes romance novels? - Yeah.  He's the least romantic person in the world.  Oh, I know.  He wants to spend Valentine's Day  getting his dog's anal glands expressed.  [cell phone dings and buzzes]  - [elevator bell dings] - Oh oh, that's the elevator.  That's him. Okay, do not say anything.  - Hey. - Hi.  Hey, buddy.  You told him.  Look, I'm not proud of it, okay?  But it pays the bills, so can we please just keep this  between the three of us?  Sylvia De La Croix, as I live and breathe.  Well, I texted him before I knew  I wasn't allowed to tell anyone.  Okay, great, your little group knows,  but can we please just keep it  between the four of us?  She burst into the decrepit flophouse,  one bosom heaving in anticipation,  the other frozen in disbelief.  I had to. You're her favorite author.  Karen, I wouldn't have pegged you  as a fan of romance novels  or of reading.  I've always seen myself in the character of Aurora.  Well, I actually just finished writing  the final book.  [glass shatters]  Huh? Wha kwah?  What do you mean?  I'm done being part of the romantic-industrial complex,  exploiting people's loneliness for profit.  It's why I hate Valentine's Day.  Oh, Valentine's Day is the worst.  What? You love Valen  [gibbering]  I'm killing her off.  [glass shatters]  Where did you get another martini glass?  It's my spare.  [upbeat trumpet and piano music]     You don't really need the tracksuits  to know what team you play on.  Go ask him.  Say, Will, Jack is working tomorrow,  and I know McCoy is out of town,  but I have two tickets to see the guys from "Queer Eye"  doing "The Vagina Monologues,"  if you would like to go.  I can't, I'm sorry busy.  Will would have loved to, yeah,  but he's got a funeral.  His aunt just died, you know, the one he's named after,  because they're both overweight spinsters.  Toodles.  Could you for once be a human being?  What?  You just invented my Aunt William  and then murdered her.  I had to.  You hurt the feelings of my male fiancÃ©,  my "Boy-oncÃ©," if you will.  I guess that makes you "Gay-Z."  Sorry, it was there. Look, I don't wanna go.  Well, of course you don't,  because that would require you to make an effort.  As it is, he already thinks you're standoffish and aloof.  His words, not mine.  He also thinks you're a cold bitch.  My words, not his.  Jack, do us both a favor  and don't do that thing that you're doing right now.  Oh oh, what am I doing right now?  Being a screeching drama queen.  [screeching] Why must you push my buttons?  Jack, just just let my relationship  with Estefan evolve organically, okay?  Don't try to control it. Don't come with up schemes.  Don't tell lies. Just let it be.  Well, I'll let it be if you promise  to make an effort with Estefan.  I will make an effort with Estefan  if you promise to let it be.  - Fine. - Fine.  Hey hug?  Sure.  I don't hug screeching drama queens.  [screeching] You're a fat monster!  Thanks again for coming in to sign my books,  Grace's Boyfriend.  You can call me Noah.  This will be much easier if I don't know your real name.  What will be easier?  Nothing.  Here are the books.  Now, is there anything I can do or say  or make Grace do sexually  to get you to not kill Aurora?  It's already done.  I just have to add a few more "probing tongues"  and "throbbing manhoods"  and send in the final manuscript tonight,  then wait for my Pulitzer.  So you haven't sent it in yet.  Then there is still time.  - Time for what? - [gun cocking]  What the hell are you doing?  Aurora lives, or the laptop gets it.    Taxi!  Taxi!  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's my cab, lady, sorry.  [grunts]  Getting my boyfriend a gift.  [camera clicking]  Not a Valentine's Day gift.  My boyfriend doesn't believe in that.  And neither do I, I guess.  Where you headed?  I don't know.  Things are good, but we're just taking it one day at a time.  I meant where am I taking you to?  Oh, uh, 15th and Madison.  I'm getting him an antique pen 'cause he's a writer.  Oh, but he's good-looking.  I don't know what you were picturing when I said "writer."  [cell phone ringtone playing]  Hey.  Hey, did you hear what happened?  Someone just attacked Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  - It's all over Twitter. - Oh, my God, is she okay?  - Twitter doesn't know. - This is awful.  God, who did this?  Oh, please don't be someone Jewish.  No.  No, some woman on Riverside Drive  knocked her over, hopped in a cab.  Wow, fleeing the scene?  What a piece of sh  Did you say Riverside Drive?  Yeah. I'll tell ya, when they find this woman,  she won't be able to show her face  anywhere in this city.  Did they say what she looks like?  No, they I don't know,  just that she was wearing a beret  and eating a salad.    Hurry up, Jack.  Hello, William.  How's it going?  It goes. It is also hanging well.  Um, awful what happened to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, huh?  Yes, you know, I had her on a flight back from Brazil.  She was very tiny.  She could be her own carry-on and then fly for free.  [laughs]  But that would have been in violation  of international law.  Okay.  Hey, you know, Estefan, just so you know,  I really do wanna spend some time with you.  - Oh. - You know, get to know each other.  Mm. Hello, tricep.  [both laugh]  Okay, hush puppy, let's go to brunch.  Something strange just happened.  Will was very sweet to me. He touched my tricep.  I'm guessing the right one? That's the good one.  Because it's the one I use to point to the exits.  Did you tell him to be nice to me?  Because I specifically asked you not to do that.  That would be humiliating.  Uh  In my village, there is a clown  who performs in the square.  People pretend to like Bobo,  but everybody laughs at him behind his back,  which is the worst possible thing for a clown.  Don't make me the clown in the square.  Oh, Estefan, I  I did nothing wrong.  Well, then there is only one possibility.  We were alone together so he could show  his true feelings.  I think Will has a crush on me.  That's ridiculous.  Will doesn't have a crush on you.  You're not a woman with no boundaries.  Well, it's either that, or you lied to me.  Oh, my God, Will has a crush on you.    Still no update on Ruth Bader Ginsburg,  but onlookers describe her assailant  as a red-haired woman in her mid-60s.  - What? - [elevator bell dings]  [scoffs]  Mrs. Timmer, can I help you?  I know it was you.  I don't know what you mean.  I know it was you.  I didn't mean to do it.  It's just that I haven't had a boyfriend on Valentine's Day  for so long, and I just wanted to get him something.  But in my defense, I had no idea  that it was Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  I thought I was just pushing down a frail old woman.  Wait, you're the one who pushed down  Ruth Bader Ginsburg?  Yeah, you said you knew that.  No, I know you're the one who stole  my Fresh Direct salad from the lobby.  That was your crime.  You better go to her, admit what you did,  and beg that tiny national treasure for forgiveness.  You're right. Okay.  But you won't tell anybody in the building, right?  Because they would hate me.  They're not so crazy about you now.  I hear things.  I say things too.  Please, please.  That's the only copy of my manuscript, okay?  If you shoot my laptop,  there may never, ever be a final book.  Oh, I never thought of that.  But you can't quit.  You're the greatest romance novelist  since Danielle von St. Lorraine.  Yeah, that's my buddy Steve Metz.  Look, Karen, I appreciate  how so very passionate you are about Aurora,  but these books take up all of my time, okay?  I need to write a real novel again.  A real novel?  These are real novels to me!  Okay, what do you say we just, uh  we we put the gun down  and just talk, you know,  like we're people without guns?  Oh, I didn't even know it was still in my hand.  That's so funny.  Don't worry, it's not even loaded.  [gun clicking]  - [chuckles] - Good to know.  Yeah, I don't like guns.  Yeah, I could tell. I saw your face.  You were like, "Wah!" [laughs]  No, honey, this is the one that's loaded.  - See? - [gunshot]  Wha  Okay, what what do you, uh what do you say  I just take these guns and, uh  and put them in this drawer  with all the other guns?  What is this place?  Listen, can't you just  rewrite the ending,  let Aurora live?  I need her.  We've been through a lot of hard times together,  especially this last year.  This is my first Valentine's alone in a very long time.  I think Aurora always finding love gives me hope  that I can too.  Karen, these books aren't about love.  Real love is sharing a bathroom and suppressing your rage  and putting up with the other person's damage.  All right, this crap's ridiculous and embarrassing.  Being ridiculous and embarrassing  is what love is.  It's standing in front of someone with  a dumb drugstore balloon and saying,  "Here I am, fully exposed."  And you're afraid of that.  I'm not afraid of love, okay?  I'm a little afraid of you.  Oh, yeah?  Well, then ask yourself this:  why are you here with me instead of being with Grace  on Valentine's Day?  Besides the ten guns?  Because Grace doesn't care  about any of that Valentine's stuff.  Oh, come on, she acts that way  because she loves you.  But inside, she's as soft and squishy  as a bird in a microwave.  Oh, yes, that old saying.  You're blowing Grace off today  for the same reason that you're killing Aurora:  because embracing romance makes you feel foolish.  Huh, that was actually kind of insightful.  Well, I had a maid who had a master's in psychology  from her home country.  Brilliant woman, but her swan napkins were crap,  so [blows raspberry]    Okay, listen to me.  Estefan's right behind me,  so no time for questions.  You have a crush on him.  It explains why you've been such an ice queen.  What? I have a crush on him?  You'll admit it. I'll say, "Get over it."  You'll tearfully promise to change.  Problem solved.  So you actually want me to pretend to be into Estefan?  Yes.  Well, then I will pretend  to be into Estefan.  Don't know why you're saying it like that,  but I appreciate it.  Will, is there something, perhaps, we need to talk about?  You know what? There is.  I'm embarrassed to say this in front of Jack, but, um  I have feelings for you.  [sighs]  I always wondered why there was  a painting of me on the wall.  Yes, yes, and I and I know  there's nothing I can do about it.  I just have to learn to live in a constant state  of tortured, unexpressed longing.  Yep, that's pretty sad. Let's go.  Or is there a way to diffuse the tension,  to quench the desire?  Uh, there is not.  Jack, this is your best friend.  How do we deal with Will's unfulfilled desire?  He'll do what he always does with his unfulfilled desire  go to his room and Google pictures  of Barack Obama windsurfing.  That won't work this time.  I think the only way to deal with these feelings  is for me to share a passionate kiss with Estefan.  For who to kiss how with Este-what?  Yes, this makes perfect sense.  Sexual tension will always exist  in the prelude to a kiss.  Once you have the kiss  [smooches] It is gone.  Yes.  It's like when you're at Panda Express  and it all smells so good and you just want everything  and then after one bite, you never, ever want  that taste in your mouth again.  So in order for Will to release me,  he must have me in his mouth once.  That's beautifully said.  Um, no bueno, seÃ±oritas.  I'm not gonna stand here and watch you two kiss.  You're right. You're right.  - That would be super inappropriate. - Exactly.  Let's go to my bedroom, where Jack can't see it  and has to fill in the details with his imagination.  If that is the only way to save my marriage.  Stop it!  I lied, okay? I lied. I lied.  Will doesn't have feelings for you.  I did ask him to be nice, and the whole thing blew up.  [sighs]  You lied to me?  Jack, this is exactly what I asked you not to do.  Okay, until further notice,  there is going to be a velvet rope  in front of my first-class area.  - [sighs] - Hey, happy Valentine's Day.  Valentine's Day sucks.  It's a dumb holiday that only leads to sadness  and the possible fall of democracy.  I get it. You're single.  I'm not [scoffs]  Forget it.  Mount Sinai Hospital.  Going to see Ruth Bader Ginsburg,  'cause I'm a good person,  no matter what everyone's saying.  You're certainly better than that piece of crap  that knocked her to the ground.  Oh, here's an update.  Going to Justice Ginsburg live now,  who's going to give a statement.  Hello, everyone.  I want you to know I'm okay  and I'm headed back to D.C.  Oh, thank God.  And to my so-called assailant,  I forgive you.  I've been a New Yorker my whole life,  and when it comes to cabs, it's every woman for herself.  I know.  Plus, you were rushing to get  a Valentine's Day gift.  I was.  I know what it means to love someone  and the crazy things we do sometimes to show it.  I do wanna show him I love him, Ruth.  15th and Madison.  I'm gonna get my boyfriend a Valentine's Day gift,  because even if he doesn't believe in romance,  I do.  Aw, that's sweet.  And when you say "boyfriend," you really mean "cat," right?  No.    Estefan said I should come over  and make things right with you, so I was like  [mumbling]  I told him, "You're not the boss of me."  And then he showed me the wheel,  which said this week, he is, in fact, the boss of me.  Please never tell me what else is on that wheel.  I guess this is the part where I say things.  - Yep. - [sighs]  Okay.  Can you tell me what they are?  I think you know.  [sighs]  Okay.  I'm a liar and a schemer and a great big drama queen.  And?  And you're attractive  in certain light.  And?  And I know your hair is real.  - And? - I'm not gonna say it.  - Say it. - [sighs]  Fine.  I weigh more than you.  This is the worst Valentine's Day ever.  Jack, I just wanted you to admit  that you're a liar and a schemer  and a big drama queen.  That's the first thing I said.  Yes, but if I'd stopped you,  we'd never have gotten to the essential truth  that my body's better than yours.  But your enormous lollipop head  throws off all your proportions.  You just don't look right.  - Jack. - What?  I promise to make more of an effort  to be friends with Estefan.  I love you. He makes you happy.  Hence I love him.  [chuckles]  Actually, that's really nice.  Would you write our vows?  - I'd be honored. - Okay.  But you have to tell people I wrote them  and get really jealous in front of all the guests  because I'm a better writer than you.  "Why can't I be as smart as Jack?"  Ha-ha! I've learned nothing!    Here it is, the new ending.  Aurora lives.  She seduces Cowboy Nick,  who unties her from the nuclear warhead.  It was either that or do something stupid.  Thank you.  And quit using Aurora as an excuse.  You have plenty of time to write  important books that no one will read.  I guess.  Yeah, maybe I had been blaming this gig  on not writing my second novel.  Mm.  You know, part of me thinks it's bec  Ah-bup-bup-bup-bup.  Not your therapist.  Now, quit your yapping and get out of here  while it's still Valentine's Day.  That's right. It's not over yet.  It's not too late.  Who are you, anyway?  What do you mean?  Are you the crazy woman who holds a gun to my laptop,  or are you the sanest woman I've ever met?  Oh, honey,  can't I just be someone who's bored of this?  "As Aurora stepped out onto the ledge,  "her dress billowing in the hot Arabian winds,  "she felt a calm wash over her.  "And in that moment, she realized  "that jumping off that building  "wouldn't be half as scary  as allowing herself to fall in love."  [tender music]  Happy Valentine's Day.  Happy Valentine's Day.  "But the thing that scares you most  "will be the thing that sets you free.  "And with a small secret smile,  "she stepped back off the ledge  and into the arms of her one true love."      
                




                    			1 "Will & Grace" is recorded in front of a live audience.  Okay, Daddy. We'll see you soon.  They're ten minutes away. My dad stopped for a hot dog.  - But I'm making dinner! - Don't make a big thing about it!  Our first meal together since your dad married my mom,  and he ruins it by eating beforehand?  Who does that?  - Grace, I'm making dinner! - Don't make a big thing about it!  Hey, look, don't stress. It's all good.  We're taking care of both parents in one swoop.  Yeah, that's true.  It'll be nice to connect with your dad  and for you to bond with my mom.  Well, I'm already close with your mom.  Yeah, you're listed in her phone  as Will's Jewish friend.  [DOOR SHUTS]  Sorry, I'm just having a tough day.  I just need to see a friendly face.  Hello, beautiful.  Who's the fairiest of them all?  Is everything all right?  Thank you.  Thank you for asking.  You've always been the nice one, Grace.  Just emotionally, I'm just  you know, I'm kind of in the weeds.  Your wedding stressing you out?  Yeah, and my play, "Gaybraham Twinkin',"  which "Time Out" magazine called  "3 1/2 hours long."  It's that long?  It was four, but I cut out the scene  of Abe manscaping.  But it still isn't enough time to cover the relationship  between Abe and his gay lover, Joshua  Wait, you said you saw it.  - We did. - And we loved it.  Prove it.  If you saw it, how was I?  - So good. - So good.  Okay, you saw it.  But I don't even care!  I'm more worried about my wedding.  I thought Karen was helping you with the planning.  That's the problem.  She's doing everything, and because she's paying for it,  I don't get anything I want.  Well, what's something you want  that she won't let you have?  - Can I show you? - Yeah.  - Is that a - It is.  A unicorn dessert station.  You choose your unicorn-themed cakes,  mini-cakes, and profiteroles here,  and then when you get to the unicorn's horn  - It doesn't. - [CORK POPS]  It does!  It shoots out marshmallow fluff!  Out of its horn!  All over your face!  It's what I dreamed of having at my wedding  ever since I was a little boy.  Okay, first of all, that is gross.  And you'll be first in line.  Hell yes!  Jack, come on!  If you want it, just put your foot down.  [SIGHS] I can't. She's paying.  It's your wedding.  I don't know. I'll do something.  Look, I have to get to the theater.  That is my life, after all.  All right, well,  break a leg.  What a horrible thing to say.  [DOOR SHUTS]  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   Martin, how's the brisket?  Good! Very good.  - Mm-hmm. - So, Mom.  Mom.  Marilyn?  Yes, Grace.  S-so now that you and Dad are living in the city,  you think you're gonna sell the Connecticut house?  Oh I don't know.  It's very personal.  I get that. I suppose if I lived  in one house for as many years  No, no, dear, your question is very personal.  I say we dump it.  Who wants to live in Connecticut?  It's so goyish. The state flower is mayonnaise.  Oh, the city is exciting.  We saw Nathan Lane last week, buying gum!  Mm!  Oh, why not? Let's sell it.  Well, you made that decision kind of fast, didn't you, Mom?  I mean, I grew up in that house.  Dad gave up on me in that yard.  Well, if Martin's not crazy about it,  why hang on to it?  Oh, besides, we could use the money  to buy a summer place.  - You want a summer place? - It might be nice.  Maybe something in Connecticut.  All right, we'll do it!  BOTH: Mwah.  You see?  That's the secret to a happy marriage.  Not communication and date nights.  Acceptance.  No fighting. Just accept.  So what are you saying, you two don't fight?  Well, that was what our first marriages were about.  Now we prefer to be happy.  - Mm. Ah. Ooh. - What?  Daddy? Are you all right?  Yeah, maybe the brisket was a little spicy.  Nothing spicy in it.  I thought it was spicy too, dear.  Ooh. Maybe a hot pepper.  There's no peppers in it.  Maybe a shard of glass.  Yes, well, the recipe did call for a cup of diced glass.  - Ah! - All right, that's it.  We're going to the hospital. Come on.  Where where's his coat?  Uh, it's on the couch, Mom.  Now, where's his coat?  Mom, it's on the couch.  Oh, he's gonna get cold.  Somebody tell me where his coat is.  Coat is on the couch, Marilyn.  Thank you, Grace.  I don't know why that was so hard.  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]    Joshua, oh, Joshua   I love you, but, oh, my gosh-ua!   What do you think of me?   Me for your thoughts   Me for your thoughts   If you like 'em tall and round   Then pick me up off the ground   I'm a penny!   So that'll replace the shadow puppet sequence,  which the police made me cut.  Good idea, honey. Keep changing it up.  It's what keeps me and the homeless man  who takes a dump in the lobby coming back.  Okay, now I'm gonna run lines for the scene  where Gaybraham tells a sleeping Mary Todd  that he's taking a fairy to Provincetown.  And that fairy is his lovah, Joshua Speed.  [PHONE RINGING]  What's up, wedding planner?  A unicorn?  That sprays what?  Out of its where?  All over your huh?  Well, who the hell asked for that?  That was me.  Uh, I just thought it'd be a hoot, you know, if,  Yeah, no, Poodle, it's ticky-tacky.  And besides, I am paying for everything, so yeah.  Just do what you did for Donald's inauguration,  but we're expecting a few more people.  Karen, maybe this one time, we could just  - Paying. - It's just that  - For. - Shouldn't we have  - Everything. - [SIGHS]  Honey! Trust me.  I know what's best for you.  But you don't understand.  My whole life, I have dreamed of a unicorn that shoots out  - [PHONE BUZZES, DINGS] - Come on!  Rory's sister can't make it tonight.  She's my Mary Todd!  "Jack, due to circumstances beyond my control,  I don't want to do the show anymore."  Great.  The one night I have an esteemed critic  from "Butt" magazine coming.  Two thumbs up from him could make or break a show.  Honey, can't you just talk to a pile of pillows  or ask Doug the Bum to step in?  I don't know. I feel weird asking Doug.  He has a Tony.  All right.  Here's what's going to happen.  I'm going to play Mary Todd.  Oh, my God, you would do that for me?  Because it's super easy. All you have to do  is lie there in bed with your eyes closed  and pretend like you're sleeping.  Oh. Honey, no prob.  That's what I used to do with Stan  when he wanted to go to fifth base.  You know wouldn't it be better  if Mary Todd had a couple of lines?  [LAUGHS]  It's a one-man show.  And I'm the one man paying for it.  [LAUGHS]  And I appreciate that. I do.  But this play's very important to me,  and I want it to be done just the right way.  Uh, let me get this straight.  You want it to be done just the right way.  - Yeah. - Okay.  Well, I think we're on the same page.  Oh. [LAUGHS]  - Phew. - [CHUCKLES]  I don't usually win these standoffs with you.  No.  You usually don't.  - Here. - Thanks.  Gosh.  This worked out so perfectly.  My dad has AB-negative blood. You're AB-negative.  I know, and I've been wanting to bond with your dad.  Now I'm gonna donate my blood.  I'll literally be inside your father.  - You want to rephrase that? - So much. So much. Yeah.  Well, this hero is off to save a life.  Maybe I'll stop by the children's ward  on the way back.  They'd like that.  Hey, Daddy. How are you feeling?  Eh, trying to figure out how to swap this bag  for a bottle of Chivas.  Where's Marilyn?  Oh, she's just filling out  some forms for the blood.  Oh, I'm surprised they had my type.  Oh, you must've been asleep.  Will's giving you blood.  - Will? - Yeah.  He's AB-negative also. I mean, isn't that amazing?  - Well - "Well" what?  I'm not taking Will's blood.  - Why? - You know why.  - Because he's gay? - Well, yeah!  - Daddy! - Look.  I know about these things.  There's a certain risk, okay?  He gets tested.  Plus, they screen the blood. It's safe.  Yeah, forget about it. I'll wait for the straight blood.  The straight blood.  Daddy, that's the most offensive thing  I've ever heard you say.  And I've gone on the It's a Small World ride with you.  Please, Grace, stop, okay?  I don't want to do this with you.  We did the MeToo thing. There was learning.  I heard you.  But this is not the time.  [SCOFFS]  What am I supposed to tell Will?  Let him think I took his blood.  That's why Marilyn and I are so happy.  We don't have to discuss every little thing.  Okay, uh, Mr. Adler, have you taken  any recreational drugs in the last 24 hours?  No.  Great, I'll give you 20 bucks  to fill this up with your urine.  Thanks.  There.  Another log on the fire should keep you warm, Mary Todd.  And while you slumber,  I steal away with my beloved Joshua  for a "work weekend" in Provincetown.  It's important to make the distinction  I say hit the gym.  I've seen you with your shirt off.  [LAUGHTER]  - Mary Todd. - [GRUNTS]  She must be talking in her sleep.  Which she oughtn't hadn't better be doing!  Where was I? Uh beach, top, bottom.  Oh, yeah.  And now  I must pack my beards.  But which beard shall I bring with me?  Not this one.  Our carriage shall arrive at any  I'm going with you.  We can stop and go antiquing,  which will probably be a lot cheaper  because everything's new.  Nay, Mary Todd.  You cannot-eth come.  Now, back to bed.  Ah!  Yeah? And who's paying for it?  In fact, who's paying  for your whole P-Town sausage party?  Why, it's me, Mary Todd.  I'm paying for everything.  - Mary Todd - Paying.  - It's just that - For.  - Shouldn't we have - Everything!  That's it!  I don't want your money!  I don't want you to pay for my play!  I don't want you to pay for my damn wedding!  To Joshua.  [FREEWHEELING PIANO MUSIC]    Hey! How's your dad doing?  Good. Great, actually.  They're gonna release him this afternoon.  Really? Well, maybe that's 'cause he's got my blood  coursing through his veins.  - Will. - Hey, keep an eye on him.  Side effects may include compulsive tweezing,  overdeveloped quads  And the urge to take shirtless selfies  in front of national monuments.  My dad didn't use your blood.  What?  He had a problem with  He didn't want to use your blood.  Ah.  Right.  Well, I  am off to bed.  Will, I get it, and the second  he is feeling better,  you need to lay into him.  He has to understand  He thinks how he thinks.  I'm not gonna say anything.  Are you kidding? Since when are you defeatist?  - Don't do that. - What? Aren't you mad?  No, Grace.  I'm tired.  W-why do I have to lead the fight?  What, every time somebody says something remotely antigay,  I have to jump in?  I've marched. I've written the checks.  I've made the calls.  But every time you think  you can exhale and have your big gay party,  somebody tells you  they won't bake your cake.  I'm not being defeatist.  I just don't want to  have to defend who I am  all the time.  I want a day off.  Your dad's not gonna change, Grace,  so accept it.  I hear that's the secret of a happy relationship.  [MELLOW PIANO MUSIC]    Honey, are you still mad at me?  I'm not even sure what happened.  Maybe it was my fault. Maybe it was yours.  Often, it's the writing.  Do you really not want me to come to your wedding?  Interesting. That's the first time you asked what I want.  Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.  It's just that I love you so much,  I want everything to be perfect for you  your play, your wedding.  I guess I've always thought of you as  Oh, this is really hard to say.  I've always thought of you as my  Son?  Not exactly.  No, more like a little sister  who we dressed as a boy  until she became a boy.  But, Karen, it's only a perfect wedding  if it's my perfect.  Honey, I hear you.  But it would kill me not to be able to come to your wedding.  Of course you'll come.  Thanks, honey.  Do you think you two queerbaits  could still find it in your hearts  to let me pay for it?  I sure would like to be the gal who's responsible  for giving everyone a face full of sweet sticky cream.  Oh, my God, this is gonna be the most beautiful wedding.  [GASPS]  Hey, tonight wasn't a total disaster.  The arts critic from "Butt" magazine  said he wants to give me a plug and a spread.  [UPBEAT MUSIC]    [DOG BARKS]    To my William.  Oh, we are so grateful  for everything you've done.  Well, maybe not the, uh, spicy meal  that put Martin in the hospital.  Salt. The spice was salt.  But definitely your giving your blood to him.  You saved my husband's life.  - You're a hell of a guy. - Yeah. Happy to help.  - Oh, my God. - Grace.  - [DEVICE PINGS] - Mm!  I gotta take a pill.  - [DEVICE PINGS] - Oh!  I gotta take two pills.  Have I sold you kids yet on getting old?  'Cause it's great!  - I'd like to give him a pill. - Stop.  Why are you two being so snippy?  Oh, is it because I didn't thank you in my toast, Grace?  Because you really didn't do that much.  - Everything's fine, Mother. - It's not fine.  Your husband refused to take Will's blood.  - Grace. - What?  Because he's gay.  Is that true, Will?  Did he say that?  Yeah.  - Is there an issue? - Of course not.  Well, why? Why didn't you tell me?  I'm just taking a page from your book, Mom.  Life is easier when everything's not a fight.  Look, it's done.  We don't have to talk about it.  Of course.  - [TOILET FLUSHES] - Why is it your soaps  never look like they've been used?  You awful, awful man.  It's just an observation.  You refused to take my son's blood?  - Mom, you don't have to - Oh, yes, I do.  We are going to have a big,  bold, loud, ethnic fight right now!  Grace, this is your area.  What do I do next?  Just go for it.  And throw in something you'll regret.  I always do.  You should be ashamed of yourself!  And you should be too, Will.  - Me? - Yes.  There are some things in life that you have to fight about.  You know, everyone seems to forget,  I just got out of the hospital.  And I had to give that nurse a urine sample!  And two of her friends!  I need some air!  Oh, no, you come back here!  I have more to say!  Oh, yes, you do.  Hey, guys.  Guys.  Thank you both.  But you're right.  I need to do this part.  Boy, that was a rush.  Must be what an Italian feels like.  Wonderful. Time for another lesson for the old man.  I don't want to hear it.  Yeah, well, I don't want to say it.  Look, I was in the hospital.  I wasn't comfortable.  It was nothing personal.  It's the most personal thing in the world!  I was trying to help you, Martin.  But I guess 'cause I'm gay, I'm not, what, clean?  Come on. You're freakishly clean.  Is there anything in your house that hasn't been washed twice?  Well, your daughter,  but that's a different conversation.  Come on.  A blood transfusion from a gay man?  I thought there were rules.  Oh, there are.  In order to donate my blood, I had to lie on the form  and say that I've been celibate for a year,  even though I've been in a committed  monogamous relationship and HIV-negative.  You lied on the form? So I was right.  No, you're not, because the law  is based on fear, not science.  Trust me, nobody spends more of their lives  thinking about being safe than gay men.  We get tested and retested.  On a first date, we swap medical histories  the way straight people swap pictures of themselves  at the same Ed Sheeran concert.  And even when we have nine kinds of proof,  we're still told we're tainted.  And to hear that from someone that I care about,  well, that's a punch in the gut.  - I am not a bad person. - I know.  You made a misguided choice based on bad information.  You're every woman that gets bangs.  I guess the good news is that  all the old, ignorant farts of the world will be gone soon.  Not good enough. You're here now, Martin.  You gotta keep growing.  And I gotta keep fighting.  Nobody gets a day off.  Sounds exhausting.  I'm sorry, Will.  I love you, you know that.  I do.  I love you too.  I promise to take your blood  next time you try to kill me with spicy food.  It was plain meat boiled for eight hours!  You ever think maybe it was that hot dog you ate?  Nah. I've had three of those every day for 30 years.  You did great, Marilyn.  Thank you.  And you can call me Mom.  Really?  Yeah, but just when we're alone.  Oh.  And, uh, will you try to read my mood first?  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]

We won again.  It was Rachel Maddow.  Oh.  - Well, you guys were great. - Mm-hmm.  - At crapping the bed. - [CHUCKLES]  But you know what? They are fun to hang out with.  They are. They're a great couple.  But come on, we're the better couple.  You know, it's almost rude how much better we are.  Should we try to be less great as a couple?  If we could, we would.  They really care a lot about the game.  [SIGHS] I know,  but they're not as pretty as we are.  [UPBEAT TRUMPET AND PIANO MUSIC]   [CELL PHONE RINGING]  What is it, Mother?  No, I am not screening your calls.  I did listen to your voicemails!  I did too, Judith!  Oh, yes I  [SIGHS]  Okay, no I didn't.  What do you want?  No, of course I'm still getting married!  Why would why do you keep asking me that?  I love Estefan.  How dare you!  No, I am not going to cheat.  Not even if the perfect man fell from the sky!  No, I'm not going to feel stuck when I get married.  I will never be stuck.  [THUDDING]  [ELECTRICAL BUZZING]  Oh, my God, I'm stuck.  Malcolm, darling, the power is still out.  I'll take off as soon as it stops snowing.  I'll just give Pilot a little nudge. Okay.  Now you listen to me, you son of a bitch.  I don't care if you have to dig that plane out of the snow  with a coke spoon,  I am flying to Islamabad tonight to see my boyfriend.  Wow, so that voice comes out of you.  I was picturing a sexy animated rabbit.  Well, that's how I picture myself except with a whip.  Um, I'm Nikki. I'm above you.  Honey, no one's above me.  [SCOFFS] Mind if I borrow your glasses?  Sure.  There you go.  Wow, you have such a weak prescription.  There's no prescription.  They're fake.  My eyes are perfect.  Then why  Well, network testing showed the glasses  make me appear more trustworthy and approachable.  So people think you're too beautiful without the glasses?  82% of viewers don't hear a word I say  when I'm not wearing them.  I'm sorry, what?  [BOTH CHUCKLING]  [BOTH SMACKING]  You know what bugs me about Will and McCoy?  Ooh, what?  They're so into each other, especially McCoy.  Love's not that showy crap.  You know, "Oh, you're so beautiful and wonderful."  Who wants that all the time?  [SCOFFS] Babies.  This is good. oh, you and me hanging out.  These last few months, I've been really happy.  - I could do this all the time. - Yeah, me too.  Hey, I've got an idea.  How about I give you a drawer here?  Some place to keep your fake glasses.  - I love that idea, Will. - Hmm.  Or I could just move in with you.  [CHUCKLES]  Oh.  Love is looking someone in the eyes  and saying "I love you, move in with me."  Yeah, I guess.  Oh.  Bad nut.  Grace, I'm asking you to move in with me.  [SPITS]  Oh, I oh.  Ah, I did it again. I moved too fast.  Why do I keep doing that? What is wrong with me?  No, no, no, wait, wait! There's nothing wrong with you.  No, you're great. You you you're wonderful.  The reason we can't move in together is it's not you.  It's Grace.  You make me happy  and you're so good with Katie and she adores you.  So what the hell, let's do this.  What's with the face? Why isn't it a "yes" face?  I I would. I mean, I would, but  But what? What what is it?  It's Will.  What about her?  Well, she's gone through some stuff, you know?  She's kind of, um, well  she's mentally unstable.  He's  broke.  Completely broke.  What, how?  Gambling.  - How unstable? - It's not good, McCoy.  [SHAKER SHAKING]  Okay, that's what that sound is.  You know, upstairs, uh,  we all thought someone played the maracas.  Isn't there, like, another smaller maraca?  That would be this.  [PILL BOTTLE SHAKING]  You're very musical.  Well, I've been playing for years.  Hello, 911?  Yes, uh, yes, I called three times!  Why isn't anybody here yet?  Did you just call me ma'am?  I am not a ma'am.  No, I am a man. I am not a ma'am.  [HIGH-PITCHED] Why would you think I was a woman?  [SIGHS]  - [KNOCK ON DOOR] - Grace, can I talk to you?  Uh, sure. Come on in.  Don't say anything about the gambling.  Hey, sorry you guys.  - [CRUNCH] - Ow!  Please tell me that's a shell and not a toenail.  Grace said the maid comes tomorrow  so we could throw whatever we want on the floor.  He's the maid.  Look at us.  Just two working gals in the big city.  Punching in everyday around 2:00,  pushing papers till 3:30,  then taking the Rolls back to the manse,  sleeping 16 hours and then it's time to make the donuts.  [CHUCKLES]  You're like my photo negative.  Hmm?  Ugh, God, it does not look like  we are getting out of here tonight.  Oh, honey, don't say that.  Girl, I just said it.  Honey.  Girl.  Honey.  Girl.  So, uh, can I talk to you for a moment?  Oh, I leave. That's how this works.  Mm-hmm.  Sorry, you know, I just have a, uh, I have a problem.  Oh, I know.  I mean, I I don't know. Why would I know?  Oh, uh, forgot my wallet.  I might need it for, um  no particular reason.  Certainly trust you.  It's so hot.  Why is it so hot in here?  [PANTING]  Must be  must be running out of oxygen.  There's no other explanation.  [AUDIENCE CHEERING]  So  Look, I I need you to back me up  and and don't ask any questions.  I told McCoy  that you're mentally and emotionally unstable.  What? And he believed you?  Instantly.  He asked to move in with me  and I panicked.  Just so just back me up on this, please!  I'd do it for you.  Yeah, um, let's test that out.  I told Noah that you're an out of control gambler.  Also a thief, but that's really just to support the gambling.  Just  [PANTING]  Man, it's so hot. I got to get out of here.  Think of a plan, Jack. Think of a plan.  Ooh, I got it!  [SCREAMING] Help!  What is going on with them?  What is going on with us?  Isn't this what we both wanted?  Yeah.  Then why didn't we say yes?  Maybe  maybe we like things the way they are.  Yes, yes, we do.  We're in a really good place. We're comfortable.  Comfortable, exactly.  You get to a certain age.  Forty-s  BOTH: Four.  And and you want comfort.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  No, exactly.  So we'll just we'll just tell the men, who love us,  that we made up ridiculous lies  because we would rather just live together.  Forever.  [CLEARS THROAT]  Or we could keep the lies going for a little while,  buy us some time.  Now that's the kind of short term thinking  we gamblers like to hear.  And I think it's just crazy enough to work.  Good, that's good.  That's good. That's a good idea.  It's a great idea.  I'm just gonna say it, we're geniuses.  I'm gonna say it, we're the better couple.  [BLOWS RASPBERRY]  [UPBEAT MUSIC]  Will? No, it's me.  Will and Grace are doing their Will and Grace thing.  I don't know where to be.  Wow, this place is really clean.  Where do you guys eat?  In the kitchen.  Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?  Yeah, have a seat.  So listen  are these flannel sheets?  Yeah, they're really great on a night like this.  I always wondered what they felt like.  Be my guest.  Don't feel weird,  I'm New York's most trusted newsman.  Yeah, all right.  - Oh, wow. - Mm-hmm.  Ooh, that's cozy.  It's nice to be in a bed where nothing crunches.  Hmm.  [CHUCKLES]  You have the most beautiful skin I've ever seen.  You're like a super-hot baby.  I know, it's both a blessing and a  actually, it's just a blessing.  So listen, uh, I just want to put it out there.  I know where Will can get some help  for his gambling problem.  Gambling problem?  You don't have to cover for him, okay?  Grace told me.  Oh, Grace told you.  That must be so hard.  Is she off her meds again?  You mean Gas-X?  No, no, she took one tonight.  A little after the fact, but still.  No, I'm talking about her anti-psychotics.  Will told me that she  You know what?  I think we've been lied to.  Nah, I I find that hard to believe.  Oh, sorry.  I think we've been lied to.  Oh, my God! We've been lied to!  This is the NYPD.  Oh, thank God!  Remain calm, ma'am. I'm coming down.  Wait, I know you.  Drew.  Jack?  So what if I make a little more effort than Malcolm?  Are you saying that you've never gone out of your way  for your man?  No, but to be fair my men are women.  Oh.  You're a vagiterian.  Question,  are you permanently parked in the lesbian zone  or do you move your car to alternate sides  of the street from time to time for plowing?  This car is parked up on blocks  with 100 tickets on the windshield.  [SIGHS]  Boils my blood!  They still give tickets for being gay!  Karen, I don't mean to judge but  look, if you're always taking care of some guy,  who takes care of you?  Besides pharmacists?  I don't know, I guess most of my life,  I've taken care of myself.  Looks like we have more in common than I thought.  Look, we know everything. So no more lies.  Six months, you've been telling me to take a leap,  open up, and when I finally do, you lie to me?  I'm sorry, it's just  No, you know what? Any excuse you're about to say  I've used a thousand times, so save it.  Grace, make a choice.  We either move forward in this relationship or we don't.  Same here. We either move in together or we're done.  I'll do anything you want. Don't leave me.  [YELLING] Am I making myself clear?!  Can Will and I just have a minute?  - Okay, one minute. - Yeah, one minute!  Take your time. I'm not going anywhere.  One minute!  This whole comfortable thing we came up with?  Complete crap.  We were just using each other as an excuse.  So what? Do we  do we go back there and say yes?  Seems kind of fast, they gave us a minute.  We should probably do stuff like like this.  It's like we're balancing our options.  Okay, and and and then I'll I'll point to myself.  Uh-huh.  - Then I'll point to you. - Mm-hmm.  Then I'll point to myself again.  And then I'll be, like, "Why didn't I think of that?  Like why didn't that go in here?"  - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - That in here. That in here.  What do you think they're talking about?  Nothing.  Ready?  Uh, okay.  We made our decision.  We're moving in with you.  I feel so excited about this!  [BOTH YELLING EXCITEDLY]  They're moving in with us!  [BOTH CHUCKLING]  [AUDIENCE CHEERING]  Hey, here's an idea. How about we switch?  Oh, right.  [YELLING EXCITEDLY]    [UPBEAT MUSIC]  This is so crazy.  So how have you been?  Yeah, I've been, you know, okay.  I've got to be honest with you though, I've, um  I never stopped thinking about you.  Well, of course.  [ZIPPING]  You probably read the reviews  of my new show "Gaybraham Twinkin'."  "Timeout New York" said,  "Hopefully, the only gay Abraham Lincoln musical  we'll ever see."  Jack, I I come here.  I made a huge mistake.  I should've never broken up with you.  Drew, I I  I'm getting married.  I mean, I was married when we first met.  Yeah, to a woman.  That doesn't count.  It's just a way to share health insurance  and double your wardrobe.  Tell me you haven't thought about me.  I have.  I've had this exact dream so many times!  Except we weren't in an elevator.  This isn't a dream.  You know, I'm here right now  and, uh  my gay cop instincts are telling me  to charge you with intent to get frisky.  Tell me, Officer, what's the punishment  for aggravated hanky-panky?  [BOTH CHUCKLING]  [RADIO STATIC]  Everything okay down there?  Yeah, yeah, um,  uh, yeah, no need for backup  and if you hear anything that sounds like kissing,  it's, um  it's probably not kissing.  So  What do you say?  This this doesn't mean we're getting back together.  Okay.  Because I I'm not calling off my wedding.  Okay.  I'm just a man  towering over a smaller man  trying to listen to what his heart says.  What does his heart say?  His heart says  Not to be this guy anymore.  What guy?  The guy that [SCOFFS]  takes the first opportunity to cheat  when the perfect man drops from the sky.  I'm sorry, Drew.  No one can tempt me more than you.  You're a delicious, cocoa-sized mini-marshmallow  but love has changed me.  I guess the men I've been with  feel like I can take care of myself.  Given some of my lovers, I've had to take care of myself.  [CHUCKLES]  If you know what I'm talking about.  I do.  I'm talking about making my Venus feel Serena.  [AUDIENCE CHEERING]  Mm-hmm.  Did not see that one coming.  Well, but you know what they say,  in every relationship, there's a gardener and a flower.  Guess I'm the gardener.  - Oh, come on. - What?  You're a flower if I've ever seen one.  You think I'm a flower?  Definitely.  And you deserve to be taken care of.  Hey, it stopped snowing.  Uh, guess you can call your pilot.  I have never said that sentence before.  Yeah.  I guess I could, but I don't think I will.  Why?  Because right now  I feel very taken care of.  Oh, girl.  [UPBEAT MUSIC]    Hey, scoot! Grace is coming over!  Of course, but when she actually moves out,  she won't be here all the time, right?  It's cute that you'd ask that.  Hi!  Uh, in bed with gay guys. If I had a nickel.  [CHUCKLES]  [CHUCKLES]  Why am I not surprised?  Climb in, Noah. It's so cozy.  Yeah, all right.

Thanks.  Hey, uh, um, Noah knows that I'm coming solo  - to your dinner party tonight, right? - Yes, he does.  Because McCoy's on assignment in London.  Wow, you work really hard to get that  into every conversation, don't you?  What, that the man I live with  is on assignment in London? No, I don't.  Assignment, London.  Whoa.  I didn't even notice that you made this McCoy's office.  And if you forget what he looks like,  you can just come into here.  It needs to feel like his place, too.  I'm sure Noah's carved out some space for you over there.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, not actual space because he's got his office  and his daughter's room, but I've got space.  Okay.

Uh, just  Noah has very particular taste.  - What's with the look? - I'm I I didn't give a look.  Oh, yes you did.  It's the "I want to weigh in on Grace's relationship" look.  I ju living together,  you know, involves compromise  and and Noah can be a kind of an uncompromising guy.  I just hope your place feels like your place, too.  Everything is good with us.  It's actually why I wanted to have this dinner party  in the first place.  It's just it's so important to me that you see  how good we are living together.  What do you think of the rug?  It's it's it's like really fun socks.  Yeah, I mean, I know that your favorite color  is lack of color, but it's fun.  It's fun, right?  - So fun. - Yeah.  I'm just worried about Katie.  I think I think she might hate it.  - How do you know that? - Because we hate the same things.  All right.  That was a very clever way of telling me  that you don't like the rug.  No, wait. You know what? I'll I just  I won't look at it.  Yeah, I'll, uh I'll look up when I walk in.  It's not like I don't know where the furniture is, right?  Oh, mother  that's fun.

Right?  Or or just say them twice.  Magical. Absolutely magical.  Right?  And go ahead and feel free to use your hands.  Mm-hmm.  What if it's so bad you can't say anything?  Oh, well, you say  "There are simply no words."  Right? Trust me.  It'll work with Grace.  Most people are so desperate for compliments,  - they won't suspect a thing. - Hmm.  [LAUGHING]  Wait, you told me you had no words  when you saw me in "Gaybraham Twinkin".  And I meant it.  Oh, my God. That is so nice.  [PIANO MUSIC]  Oh, Nikki, these last few weeks with you  have been incredible.  And, uh, presidentially speaking,  let's just say that I prefer Bush over Johnson.  Well, that's the highest compliment you can pay someone  in my community.  I guess it's kinda my community now, too, huh?  [LAUGHS]  Oh, uh, unless you're talking about  the African American community, which still refuses  to accept me as one of their own.  I'll call Shonda.  Oh.  But I I do mean the gay community.  But, um, is that really you either?  What do you mean?  Do straight women want to do the things to you  - that I do? - Oh, yeah.  Come here.  I need to know if you're just trying something out.  I mean, if you're ashamed to be seen with me  I'm not ashamed.  I took you out to dinner last week.  In Berlin.  You got me on the down low.  Have you even told your friends about us?  No, not yet.  But I've been thinking.  I think it's time for me to dump all of my friends  and get new ones who are black and gay like us.  I'm sorry, Karen. I can't do this.  I I need to be with a gay woman,  and if you're not in this 100%,  I'm out.  [DRAMATIC PIANO MUSIC]  [DOOR CLOSES]  Hello, papi chulo. Hello, Will.  Jack, I was thinking, why don't you make a list  of what you need to bring for the wedding?  Hush, papi.  I don't need to make a list. I have everything.  I have the rings, the tux, my passport  which is up to date.  I'm glad you renewed it early.  McCoy had to had to do his last minute,  - 'cause he's - ALL: On assignment in London.  - We know. - Yes.  Okay, just one more thing, Jack.  I promise.  Do you have the 13 gold coins  which you will present to me at the altar?  [CHUCKLES] This guy.  Of course I have the coins.  It's the first thing I packed. [LAUGHING]  Now get out of here, all right? Come on.  Don't worry about a thing, okay?  - Okay, I'm sorry. - No worries.  You have no idea where those coins are, do you?  Oh, my God.  I brought them over to show Karen at the bachelor party.  Uh, they were in a little coin purse,  but I must have lost it somewhere.  Coin purse?  That sounds small and hard to find.  What do I do? What do I do?  Well, I guess you better run around the apartment  like a crazy person looking everywhere.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God! He was right about me!  Here's I I  I am forgetful and irresponsible!  He was totally right!  - And bad at finding things. - I can't find anything!  What's so special about the gold coins?  Oh, I don't know. Some Spanish tradition.  I I I tried to Wikipedia them,  but I accidentally went to Dickipedia  and stayed there all night.  - [COINS RATTLING] - Jack.  Would you stop jingling whatever you're jingling?  I'm trying to  [KEYS RATTLING]  You son of a bitch.  You really enjoyed that, didn't you?  I really did. Here.  I counted them. There's only 12.  You're missing one.  Hey, me again.  I just want to say, forget about the list.  None of those things matter as long as you are there.  Oh, thank God.  - That's such a relief. - [CHUCKLES]  Except the coins.  The 13 gold coins are the most important tradition  in a Spanish wedding.  They symbolize our trust, and they must be there.  But the rest, who cares?  Everything can be replaced.  The coins cannot be replaced.  You probably got that they were not included  when I said everything, but I wanted to make sure.  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]    I'm missing one gold coin, Rory.  No, there is not a reward.  Just call me if you find it.  I hate every single one of my friends.  Not Karen.  Hey, guys.  Oh, hi!

He's on assignment in London.  BOTH: Drink.  Sorry, it's just a little inside joke.  I think I got it.  Anyway, you know, it's been an adjustment  with McCoy, sharing a space.  Compromising.  Sure it's been the same for you.  No, it's actually been pretty seamless for us.  Really? Well, you  you've obviously learned how to give up control  to the TV remote, 'cause you try to take it  from this one, she turns into Joffrey.  Am I right?  Uh, who who is Joffrey?  Oh, he's from "Game of Thrones."  It's a show.  We don't have a TV.  Yeah, I I can't have a TV.  I'd never pick up a book.  Mmm.

We're lesbians.  All we do is talk. [LAUGHS]  Ow.  Noah, I am blown away by your bathroom.  One bottle and it is both the shampoo and the conditioner.  I'm so glad you're back. How about a toast?  Um, Noah, you're better with words than me.  Oh, yeah, I'm I'm not great at toasts.  Don't be so modest.  Seriously, I I don't think I  Yes, please. You are a writer.  Maybe a beautiful toast about our wedding.  Guys, I  I'm not gonna be able to come to the wedding.  - What? - You're kidding.  That is a terrible toast.  I'm really sorry, guys.  My best friend, Steve, who's been living abroad  for ten years is coming into town this weekend.  But it's in three days. When were you gonna tell us?  After the party.  I thought it might create an awkward moment.  Guess I was wrong.  This is not what being gay is.  Especially not for you.  Yeah.  I guess you're right.  You know, I Googled "butch lesbian",  but I guess I'm more of a lipstick lesbian.  Wanna go figure it out on a pile of coats  in Noah's bedroom?  I would like that very much.  I can't believe Noah's not coming to our wedding.  I know.  The saddest part is that he will not get to see me  receive the 13 golden coins.  I can't take it!  Estefan, look, I love you, and I know how much  those coins mean to you.  - But the truth is - [KNOCKING]  - What? - Jack, I have your coin.  The truth is, I'm pretty darn sick of you doubting me  and I'd like a moment alone with my thoughts.  Oh, okay.  I will just go look at his bathroom again.  He has a bar of soap that says, "Dial".  Harry, you found my coin?  The ER doctor did.  He asked me how it got where it did,  and everything came flooding back.  Me not wanting to dance,  Will saying I was a dancing machine,  you saying if someone put a coin in me,  BOTH: I had to dance.  [LAUGHS]  Now I remember!  Karen put a coin u  Please don't finish that sentence.  Noah, this is Jack's wedding.  I know, Grace, but Steve's my best friend.  Jack is one of Grace's best friends.  You could fly and see him as soon as we get back.  No, we've been trying to get together forever.  Noah  This is really important to me.  And this is really important to me.  Okay.  I understand.  I guess.  There really are no words.  Hey, great news.  I found the coin. [LAUGHING]  Funny story.  Which you will probably enjoy at a later date.  I can't do this.  I'm going home before I say something I'll regret.  'Cause you're right.  Grace would kill me if I actually told her  that she could do so much better than Noah.  She is standing right behind me, isn't she?  She is.  And she wants you to leave.  You don't think I don't know what you've been doing?  Feeding me vague compliments like we're backstage  at one of Jack's shows?  Oh, no, no, this is different.  Uh, he doesn't mean the compliments he gave you.  Look, I was trying to avoid a fight.  But come on. Blowing off Jack's wedding?  - That's kind of a big deal. - It's his best friend, Will.  I I've gotta be flexible about this.  He hasn't made any space for you, Grace.  I know you feel that, too.  Look, is Noah perfect? No.  Not even close.  And he's a lot to deal with.  Sometimes he's an absolute bummer.  And he's standing right behind me, isn't he?  Wow, the rare double-double.  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]

Can we  - Of course. Yes. - Oh, gosh!  [SHUTTER SNAPS]  - What are we going to do? - Well, we'll be okay.  I mean, lots of couples make the long-distance thing work.  Name one.  You can't!  Um, that guy was in the picture, so do  - Let's take another. - Oh, good!  All right.  [SHUTTER SNAPS]  Oh, I look bad in this one, too.  Everyone looks bad next to him!  Move it along.  - Jack. - Ohh  please tell me you found a way for us to get to Spain.  Oh, wouldn't that be nice? But no.  We are getting married at midnight  right here at gate 35A! The nicest of the 35s.  Papi, I know it's not Spain,  but at least our wedding will not be on a Tuesday.  Oh, thank God.  Because we wouldn't want our wedding to be cursed  by being forced to have it at an  oh, I don't know, an airport!  What what, do you want to have our honeymoon in a men's room?  Jack, that's where we had our second date.  [UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC]  Welcome to the pre-wedding cocktail hour.  As you can all see, this is not a castle on a hill in Spain.  But Estefan did find an airport White Castle.  And this jar of Spanish olives for the reception.  So  yay.  There will also be no unicorn dessert station,  no magical up-lighting.  I mean, it's an airport. There's nothing.  [LAUGHS]  [SOBS]  Who's going to perform the ceremony?  That part is set. Estefan's tio, Alberto.  He's a judge on "Spain's Got Talent."  - Isn't he in Spain? - Your point?  Five, four, three, two  Excuse me.  Oh, my God, I didn't even think of this.  If Jack's getting married here, Noah can come.  - I'm going to call him. - I have no opinion on that.  I wasn't asking for your opinion.  - Well, none was offered. - None was requested.  Nor was one forthcoming.  Oh, go put your head condom back on.  So I just got off the phone with the network,  and it turns out I didn't get the job.  What, no! Darn it, those dummies.  [GRUNTS]  - It's okay if you're happy. - I am, I'm sorry.  But I'm thrilled for us.  We both know the long-distance thing never works.  Yes, I agree, and that's why I told them  thanks but no thanks.  Wait, why did you thank them for not giving you a job?  Well, I was just being polite.  You know how the Brits are.  [BRITISH ACCENT] Tut-tut, spot of tea.  On your marks, get set, bake!  Okay, they they offered me the job, but I said no.  Sweetie, you can't turn down your dream job because of me.  - I don't want to lose you. - Well, if you stay,  you'll end up resenting me. I couldn't stand that.  You got to call them back.  I know.  Another round, barkeep.  - Hello, Mrs. Walker. - Smitty?  You work here, too?  Because of all the death and illness in my family,  I have to work multiple jobs.  Though I guess dancing while Wall Street guys  throw lit cigarettes at me, well,  that's not really a job.  Oh, Smitty. You are a treasure.  If I wasn't a lesbian, I would kiss you.  - I'm a lesbian now. - You are?  Oh, my gaydar must be going the way of my hearing  and and my sense of smell,  and and my ability to digest solid food.  [LAUGHS]  Smitty, you got to give a gal a chance to breathe.  [LAUGHS]  Oh, it's just that after my marriage ended,  I didn't know who I was or what I wanted.  And then, Nikki came along and told me.  And now, I am exactly who I'm supposed to be.  I think.  I don't know.  Did you ever think that maybe you're not gay?  You're just lost.  [LAUGHS]  Wait a minute, that's not funny.  [BRIGHT PIANO MUSIC]  Chardonnay, please.  Noah's not coming. We do not need to get into it.  Ah.  That is such a "you" thing to say.  - Mm. - Oh, now you're lecturing me?  I get it, it's a bummer. He's a bummer.  - Are you happy? - Are you happy?  I'm happy enough. Noah is kind, and he loves me.  You get to a point in your life where you're lucky  if you get 60% of what you want.  - Grace - It's not sad.  - It's a reality. - Don't say that.  - You - No, do not tell me  that I could do better, because I can't.  - I can't do better. - Wow.  I wish you could see yourself the way I see you.  Because if you did, you'd know you deserve 100%  of what you want.  [GROOVY PIANO MUSIC]    We have another problem.  Than the one next door. We don't have anybody to marry us.  You big gay bitch!  I just found out that you're getting married,  and you didn't invite me!  I know, I'm so sorry. We totally forgot.  That bothers me, Jack.  If I wasn't on my way to Tampa to marry my sister  Hey, you cannot marry your sister.  In Florida, you can.  I'm not marrying her, you dummies.  I'm performing the ceremony. I'm ordained.  Wait, you can marry people? Would you ever consider, like  All right, I'll do it for 75 bucks.  - 25 bucks. - 100.  - 200. - You got yourself a deal.  [BRIGHT PIANO MUSIC]    Oh!  - Oh, oh! - Oh!  - I'm so sorry. - No, no, no, no, no.  I'm sorry, I just I bit into the  - Gooey center? - I call it the pearl.  Oh, please, don't stop eating.  That is the nicest thing a guy has ever said to me.  I find that kind of hard to believe.  You know, I was going to get one of those  sad little airport cookies, but then, I thought  "why settle for mediocrity  when there is this deliciousness out there?"  Agreed.  - Marcus. - Grace.  - Where you headed? - Nowhere.  My friend is getting married here in the airport.  Oh, that's where I want to get married.  - Really? - No.  [LAUGHS]  Just my indelicate way of telling you  that I'm not married.  - Smooth. - Yeah.  [CHUCKLES]  - Where you going? - Uh, Italy.  Yeah, then France, and then, I don't know where.  - Wow, that sounds amazing. - Yeah, yeah.  I just I woke up one day, and I thought  I don't know, you ever just have one of those moments  where you just you rethink your entire life?  Constantly.  [CHUCKLES]  How long you going away for?  Mm, as long as it makes me happy.  - Oh. - And as long as I  - can pass for a Canadian. - I wish I could do that.  Not the Canadian part. I'm too loud.  The dropping everything and just taking off thing.  - Oh, then do it. - Oh, I  [SCOFFS]  I don't do stuff like that.  What, something you want to do when you want to do it?  Don't make it sound reasonable.  Look, sometimes, the things we do without thinking,  they end up being the best things that we ever do.  Really? Because I have a Bowflex  and cargo pants that would say otherwise.  Hey, you wouldn't want to with  Oh oh, man, forget it.  I'm I'm going to sound like a crazy person.  Uh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You just you seemed so  [STAMMERS]  Forgive me. Okay, enjoy your wedding.  - Hey. - Yeah?  Points for almost asking.  [BRIGHT PIANO MUSIC]  Hey, babe.  [LAUGHS]  So wait, what was the thinking  behind getting married at an airport?  The DMV was booked?  [CLEARS THROAT]  Look, um, I need to say something.  You know how I've said that being with you  has changed me, and you've said that  maybe I'm not being totally honest with myself.  What are you trying to say?  Mm, what do you think I'm trying to say?  Karen, I can't say it for you.  [EXHALES]  It's just so hard. I just  I've realized that  I am  [EXHALES]  [CHUCKLES]  Why can't I say the word? Why can't I just say it?  What what is wrong with me? Why am I so ashamed?  Why can't I just speak my truth and be who I am?  Nikki  [BUTTON CLICKS]  I'm straight.  [ECHOING] I'm straight, I'm straight  I'm straight I'm straight I'm straight  There are children around!  [BRIGHT MUSICAL FLOURISH]  So, about to be married at an airport.  Worst wedding since Batman married Robin  in that filthy cave.  Look at it this way.  You waited for the right one. You didn't settle.  You didn't care about the distance or the obstacles.  And you're both really, truly gay.  It's not like one of you is gay and black  and the other one is white, straight, and lost.  ["HERE COMES THE BRIDE" PLAYS]    Buddy, this is your moment. Today, it's all about you.  I have waited to hear you say that for 30 years.  If you hurt my Jackie,  I know someone who will reach up inside you  and turn you inside out.  [PURRS]  No, not in the good way.  Thank you.  - Gracias. - [COINS RATTLE]  Mi amor, you look beautiful.  I know.  Queerly beloved, we are gathered here  under this extremely harsh lighting  that I wouldn't wish on my evil twin sister  she should rot in Hell  to unite these two "men"  In holy matrimony.  And now, I believe that both Jack and Estefan  have prepared their own vows. Jack?  Estefan, you know me well enough to know  that I have prepared nothing.  It's true, I know that.  For months, all I've ever talked about  was having the perfect wedding.  I wanted it to be the greatest moment of my life.  And now, standing here, looking in your eyes  [EXHALES]  I know I got exactly what I wanted.  This is perfect.  Flight 201 to Dallas, Fort Worth,  has been moved to gate 63.  Like I said, perfect.  You are the love of my life.  Te amo.  Te amo siempre, Jack.  [OFF-KEY]  Tu llenas mis sentidos   Como una noche en el bosque   [NOSE HONKS]  Like a mountain in springtime   No, no, no.  - It's going to be okay, McCoy. - No, it's not.  We're going to break up, and I'm going to  have to go back to dating underwear models  and Bravo executives and Italian soccer stars.  - It's going to be hell. - Ah, well, me too.  What with all the part-time piano teachers  and no-show Grindr dates.  I I totally get it.  How do you keep a relationship going from so far apart?  - You can't. - Unless  [ESTEFAN CONTINUES SINGING IN SPANISH]  Unless what?  And now, do you, Jack, take Estefan  as your lawfully-wedded husband?  Maybe everything else was not as I planned,  but this moment is.  All eyes are on me as I say  I will! I will marry you, Will Truman!  [SCREAMING] I knew it!  I knew it!  Jack, Jack, Jack, you're still getting married first.  I'm dying inside.  That helps. Let's keep going.  [BRIGHT PIANO MUSIC]  That was the craziest, most impulsive thing  I have ever seen you do, and I have never been prouder.  Yeah, yeah, it's weird, because crazy and impulsive  is usually your department.  Did we switch bodies when we opened  that book of magic spells?  You inspired me, though.  I'm kind of thinking about doing something  crazy and impulsive myself.  Is it something that has the chance  of making you more than 60% happy?  It might.  Well, then go. Go get yourself some happy.  Smitty, this isn't like me, but I'm happy for my friends.  I guess it makes me feel like  maybe there's a chance that I'll find love again.  [LAUGHS]  Mrs. Walker, you're hilarious.  We have a boarding opportunity for passengers  traveling flight 6150  Ma'am are you boarding?  I was just um, uh, waiting for someone.  I guess it was crazy.  Hold up. Hold the gate.  [BRIGHT MUSIC]  Hi.  Hi.  Ooh, the first song is husband and husband.  Come on, let's dance. Will!    I was looking for you.  Here I am.  Love is in the air   Love is in the air   Love is in the air   Love is in the air   Love is in the air
