


                    			Excuse me.
 There's a line, buddy.
 There's two lines.
 No, no, there's one line.
 We're in it.
 I'm just getting a hot dog.
 We're all getting hot dogs.
 What, you think there's two lines and we're all in this line-- you're the only genius that got in the other line? Can you believe this guy? Don't line up behind him.
 He cheated you.
 Hey, shut up.
 What do you want on yours, baby? I want all the hot dogs, please.
 Yeah, I'm--I'm buying all the hot dogs.
 Oh, come on, lady.
 And I'm giving them to the good people.
 Who's that? Kicking it down the street Causin' a stir.
 Who's that? I know that you're wondrin' That's her That's her, that's her, that's her, that's her.
 Who's got the kind of charisma that The boys prefer.
 Who's hot and you know that she knows it.
 That's her.
 She's like a summer sky.
 It's like some cherry pie.
 And there is butterfly.
 Me oh my.
 Who flaunts her feminine magic.
 That's her That's me! That's Pam! The overly-confident morbidly obese woman.
 This fat suit smells like corn chips.
 Going again, please.
 Thank you.
 And this is the set of The Girlie Show.
 It's a real fun ladies' comedy show for ladies.
 Hey, everybody.
 Look, here's someone you never get a chance to meet.
 It's the head writer of The Girlie Show, Liz Lemon! The Girlie Show.
 Hold on, I'll connect you.
 Hey.
 What's up? Hey, have you looked at that Cat Lady sketch? It's still seven minutes long.
 Yikes, okay.
 Oh, and Standards has a problem with that Michael Jackson bit.
 But why? Apparently you can't say he's got a vagina.
 Oh, it's--fine, I'll just take the whole thing out.
 Hey, you gotta tell that NBC page to take it down a notch.
 Oh, you mean Ken? Yeah, he just embarrassed me in front of a whole tour group.
 I'll talk to him.
 What is this? Ah, well, you know how I hate it when people cheat or break rules? Yes, I do.
 Well, I just spent Atta boy.
 Chumley.
 The beverage situation around here is reprehensible.
 Oh, good morning, sunshine.
 Surely our massive conglomerate parent company could spring for a samovar of coffee.
 Yeah, or like a big coffee dispenser.
 That's what a samovar is.
 Are there other black nerds, or is it just you and Urkel? Uh, Cerie, do you wanna get some coffee? No, thank you.
 No? Hey, Josh.
 I need to change your Michael Jackson thing.
 Didn't you tell me you had a Jay Leno impression? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Check it out.
 So, uh, President Bush is in the news again.
 Have you heard about this? No, Jay Leno.
 The host of the Tonight Show.
 I thought that's what I was doing.
 So, uh, my wife Mavis and I like to go shopping for old cars.
 You know? No, no.
 Like Jay Leno.
 Like, "Hey, here are the headlines.
" You ever--you ever notice when you eat a lot of cheese, and you-- How is that different from what I was doing, though? And I don't think you need to introduce the writers to the tour group.
 I agree.
 I thought they would find it interesting, but they really did not.
 Well, Kenneth, just respect their privacy.
 I promise I'll do better, Mr.
 Hornberger.
 Sure you will.
 I just-- I just love television so much.
 We all do.
 Liz, they want you and Pete on the 50th floor.
 Who, Gary? Tell him I'll be up in half an hour.
 No, they said now.
 If they got cookies up there, grab some.
 Ooh, and get them to pay for my Samovar.
 Of course, I mean, I assume that's what we're meeting about.
 What about, uh, Ray Romano? Can you do Ray? Hey.
 God, oh.
 Debra.
 There you go.
 My brother's tall.
 Right? Are we in trouble or something? No way.
 Gary loves the show.
 Pleased with the ratings.
 Right.
  Of course.
 They love us.
 Where's Gary? Gary's dead.
 I'm Jack Donaghy.
 New VP of development for NBC/GE/Universal/Kmart.
 Oh, we own Kmart now.
 No.
 So why are you dressed like we do? I'm surprised you're renovating.
 This is such a nice office.
 It's a great office, but sometimes, you have to change things that are perfectly good just to, uh, make them your own.
 Please.
 Ah, I'll call her back.
 Is she at the White House line? Great.
 Tell them I need a 4:00 a.
m.
 tee off time.
 Uh, five inches, but it's thick.
 Are you familiar with the GE Tri-vection Oven? I don't cook very much.
 Sure, I got you.
 New York, third wave feminist, college educated.
 Single and pretending to be happy about it.
 Overscheduled, undersexed, you buy any magazine that says "Healthy body image" on the cover.
 And every two years, you take up knitting for A week.
 That is dead on! What, are you gonna guess my weight now? You don't want me to do that.
 That knitting thing is uncanny.
 How do you do that? Market research, my friend.
 Years and years of market research, which lead to my greatest triumph.
 The Tri-vection oven.
 Oh, my wife wants one of those.
 Could we get Pete an oven, please? Hey.
 The GE Tri-vection oven cooks perfect food five times faster than a conventional oven, because it uses three kinds of heat.
 Thermal  technology for consistent temperature.
 GE Precise Air convection technology for optimal air circulation, and microwave technology for incredible speed.
 With three kinds of heat, you can cook a turkey in 22 minutes.
 Wow.
 That is impressive.
 The people upstairs think so.
 That's why they promoted me.
 That's why they sent me here to retool your show.
 Retool what now? I'm the new vice president of east coast television and microwave oven programming.
 That sounds like you program microwave ovens.
 I like you.
 You have the boldness of a much younger woman.
 Lee, does my face look bloated to you? When I played that lady rapist on Law &amp; Order, guess what the makeup guy put on under my eyes to take the puffiness out? Hemorrhoid cream.
 Ms.
 Maroney? I have the cat wrangler here for you.
 Oh, is it that horrible little--Hi.
 Hey.
 Greta Johannsen.
 It's short for "LaGreta.
" Hi, great to see you again.
 You too.
 I'm here to introduce you to feline actors you're gonna be working with tonight.
 Okay.
 This is Po-Po.
 And this here is Captain Boots.
 Hello.
 Uh, would you describe yourself as "cat competent?" Oh, yes.
 I love cats.
 I used to have two cats.
 But then I moved to this place with hardwood floors, so we had to put them down.
 I'm joking.
 I've done several focus groups, on this show, and what I've gleaned-- The blonde, big-eyed girl is popular with women and older gays.
 Jenna, that's my friend Jenna.
 And the kid with the funny hair is liked by women, but you're missing men between 18 and 49.
 I'm not missing them, they're just not there.
 I think I can fix that.
 So your job is, you take things that are already working, and you fix them.
 That's a great job.
 Okay, let's-- Why don't we, um-- You're missing that third kind of heat.
 I want you to think about Tracy Jordan.
 Okay--the black guy? The black movie star.
 I flew with him on a private jet to the Super Bowl recently, and I found him very entertaining.
 Isn't he, um crazy? Tracy's had his problems in the last few years.
 I am a Jedi! I am a Jedi! I am a Jedi! The important thing to remember is, he was never charged with a crime.
 It's not illegal to fall asleep on your neighbor's roof.
 Nor should it be.
 Tracy Jordan is the third heat.
 I don't know where we're gonna find room in the budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan.
 I think I do.
 What are you doing? Sometimes when I have these stress dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I come out of it.
 "This is not a dream.
" Tracy Jordan is in New York today, Liz.
 I'd like you to have lunch with him.
 We have a show tonight, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I don't know if your research covered this, but we do a dress rehearsal, and then a live show.
 That's  tonight.
 This is lunch.
 If it's not a good fit, I'll drop the whole thing.
 If I meet with Tracy Jordan, and we mutually agree that this is the worst idea ever, you'll back off? I'm known for being reasonable.
 Okay.
 Alfredo, 2:00 p.
m.
 I'm not dressed for that.
 You're dressed for Burger King.
 Should we make it Burger King? Pete, hang back for me.
 Yeah, you bet.
 Hey.
 What happened to your head? Uh, the sky is falling.
 Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow? Thank you, Lee.
 Whatever.
 Hey, you know in that Cat Lady sketch? Do I have to hold a real cat? Cat Lady sketch? That thing's gonna get cut.
 Oh, good.
 Who's that? That is the new network dude.
 Mmm, yummers.
 He reminds me of Scotty on General Hospital.
 What? No, ew, Jenna.
 Do not like that man.
 That is a bad man.
 God, you have a gift.
 Laura Bush is your size.
 Hi, uh, what are you doing down here? I'm known for being hands-on.
 Clearly.
 That's how you should dress for work, by the way.
 Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines.
 Afghanistan is a different situation I'll have an apple juice.
 Oh, we don't have apple juice, sir.
 Then I'll take a vodka and tonic.
 Hi, I'm Liz Lemon.
 I know who you are.
 I thought there was a strict dress code at this place.
 I do recommend the pumpkin ravioli.
 They're very subtle.
 So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy wanted me to talk to you about joining the cast of our show.
 And I don't know how you feel about that-- Lemme ask you a question.
 Everybody at this table.
 Did  he just say the word "pumpkin" to me? Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli.
 Yo! I'm buggin'.
 I can't do this.
 I cannot eat here.
 I can't eat here.
 I got to go someplace where they make food that I like.
 Lemon, let's go.
 I will not work with Tracy Jordan.
 It's just a rumor.
 Have you seen any of his movies? The guy's sensibility is just cretinous.
 I saw the one where he plays, like, five different characters.
 Yeah, Black Cop/White Cop.
 No.
 Who Dat Ninja? No, he-- He had to pretend to be this old lady Ooh, ooh, ooh! Goodness gracious! You hooligans better watch out.
 'Cause this honky grandma be trippin'! Oh, yeah.
 That movie was hilarious.
 I saw it like five times.
 Where's the love? Right on, let me get two apple chickens and some pecan waffles.
 Nothing for me, I-- I had, like, four hot dogs this morning.
 Eat, Lemon.
 Eat! I hate skinny women.
 Hey, Lorna.
 Ten beers.
 So, Tracy, we should talk about the show.
 Yeah, I ain't doing it unless I can get to do it my way.
 You know, I want it to be raw.
 HBO-style content.
 Well, it's not HBO.
 It's TV.
 And I don't think that it's a good fit-- You know, cause I wanna drop truth bombs.
 You know how pissed off I was when Us Weekly said that I was on crack? That's racism.
 I'm not on crack.
 I'm straight up mentally ill! Sure.
 I got mental health issues.
 Sure, well, you know Who doesn't, really? Hey, has anyone seen Liz? Or Pete? She went out.
 Well, who's in charge when they're not here? I'm in charge.
 Oh.
 Okay.
 Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume.
 I think it's hot.
 Thank you.
 I'm Jenna, by the way.
 Ms.
 Moroney, I got the hemorrhoid cream you wanted.
 It's for my face.
 Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working.
 You know, I don't-- I don't think you'd like it.
 'Cause we work a lot of hours, and it's live TV, which is risky.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 I like risky.
 See, me and you, we play the game.
 We know how to be acceptable.
 Hello, great meeting.
 I drink coffee, please.
 This show is our chance to break the shackles.
 'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail.
 What white dudes? All of 'em.
 Jack Donaghy, General Electric, George Bush, Karl Robe.
 Karl Robe, you say? Affirmative action was designed to keep women and minorities in competition with each other.
 To distract us while white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets.
 That's a metaphor.
 Sure.
 You should tell that to Us Weekly.
 Hey, Lemon.
 You like karaoke? I know a joint.
 No, no, I-- I gotta wrap up this lunch meeting, Tracy.
 I'll take you.
 I'll take you.
 I just gotta make a quick stop first.
 You know what, when people say they need to make a quick stop, they usually mean at the bank or the store.
 No, thank you.
 You know what, this is for computer classes.
 Know why I should do this TV show, Lemon? I really don't.
 To get you rich.
 'Cause you know if I'm on that TV show, it's gon' blow up.
 How do you know I'm not rich? Your teeth.
 You got to think like these strippers, Lemon.
 They know the window of opportunity's only open for a moment.
 You gotta get in when you're young.
 Get the money and get out.
 Yeah, well, I'm not a sex worker, Tracy.
 I don't have sex for a living.
 Neither do we.
 Neither do they.
 Yes, they do.
 Where is my phone? We are strong No one can tell us we're wrong Searching our hearts for so lo-ong He's got charisma.
 No, that's Charisma over there.
 Girlie Show.
 Ken, send me a car, okay? What is your location? Dark Sensations, in the Bronx.
 I wish you were here.
 Mr.
 Donaghy does not get us showbiz people.
 Let me talk to Pete, okay? Oh, Pete got fired this morning.
 That's so weird that you don't know that.
 Jack Donaghy thinks he's gonna come into my house and mess with my show? Hell no.
 Jenna and I worked for years to get this show.
 You know, I moved from Chicago for this.
 From Chicago? I was in Scottie Pippen's wedding.
 Now Donaghy is trying to steal it from us.
 He already fired Pete, who is a great producer.
 He fired Pete? He can't fire Pete.
 You know what, I quit.
 He can suck it.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah, suck it, Pete.
 No, you're not listening.
 You're not a good listener.
 But Liz said we were cutting the cat lady sketch.
 She said it stinks.
 Ouch.
 This is why Liz is wrong.
 Animal humour is universal.
 I  just don't think that I'm good in it.
 Do you think I'm good in it? I think this is your opportunity to go out there and prove everybody wrong.
 What--what do you mean? Who's everybody? The network that wanted to fire you, the focus groups that said you had a weird eye-- You mean this eye? Okay, this eye-- It doesn't open all the way because when I was little, my sister peed in it.
 Tonight is your opportunity to go out there and change all of our minds.
 What? Where is Liz? Liz?! Four minutes to air.
 That's four minutes to air.
 Is Liz back yet? No, which cat do you want Jenna to carry? I'm sorry? Which cat? Oh.
 I wantthat one.
 Jack Donaghy to the control room, please.
 Jack Donaghy.
 Peanut's not an actor.
 I just--I just rescued him from a lab.
 Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off.
 Where do you live? The studio.
 I want you to drop me at the studio.
 I want to tell Donaghey to his face that I quit.
 And I want to do it in front of the whole crew, so that they know he didn't fire me.
 I wanna see that.
 Gonna turn the lights down low.
 It's almost time for the Girlie Show Ooh, ooh, pull over.
 Pull over here.
 Tracy, I don't have time for this.
 This is where I grew up.
 This is the Jordan family estate? Wasn't no Jordan family nothin'.
 This is where I was in foster care.
 Oh.
 Sorry.
 Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
 I'm so lucky I got out of here.
 It's not luck, I mean You got out of here because you're very talented, and people love you, and Are you peeing? Where's Donaghy? I wanna talk to him right now.
 Last time I saw him, he was riding a crane camera.
 Oh, I have Pete for you.
 Pete, oh, my God.
 I didn't know.
 No, hey, listen.
 It'll--it'll give me a chance to spend more time with my kids.
 I'm quitting.
 I'm quitting right now.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 You have the best job in New York.
 Don't quit over this.
 Don't buy all the hot dogs.
 Okay? I don't want to do this without you.
 Hey, I thought we cut the Cat Lady sketch.
 We're two minutes short! So, let me introduce myself.
 My name is Lurleen Katz.
 And these are my cats.
 She's using a real cat? I cast that cat myself.
 And sir, while they are my-- Ow! Aaugh! No, no, no, no, no.
 He's okay.
 I need you to talk for two minutes.
 About what? Anything.
 All right.
 These cats are more than just pets, sir.
 Why, just this morning-- Excuse me! Where is the manager? I'm from the government, and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets.
 Uh-oh.
 Look at Shorty.
 This honky grandma be trippin'.
 What's up, America? I'm coming into your house live.
 Lemme hear you say "We love you, Tracy.
" We love you, Tracy! I am the third heat! He's brilliant.
 Are you drunk? Yes.
 Why did you fire Pete? Why did you disappear all night? Is this some kind of a power play? Yeah, yeah.
 It's not so fun being "hands on" with these bloodsuckers, is it? Could we talk about this on Monday? No.
 I want Pete back.
 I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe, and I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room.
 Fine.
 I thought you were going to quit.
 Yeah, well, you don't know everything about me.
 You weigh 127 pounds.
 Yeah.
 Thank you, good night.
 You will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer.
 Good night, sleep tight.
 I can't wait to do this with you every week.
   

                




                    			I thought Tracy was getting here at noon.
 Movie stars move at their own pace, Liz.
 We have to accommodate them.
 Yeah, well, a lot of people are still upset about Tracy joining the show.
 That's not my problem.
 I have other things on my plate.
 You hear about that chemical factory explosion outside of Colorado Springs? No.
 Good.
 All right, here he comes.
 I just think when it comes to this whole Tracy thing, it's best to trlightly.
 No, no, no.
 Stop, stop.
 Stop, stop.
 It's just us.
 Lemon, to tread lightly is your job.
 My job is to keep Tracy Jordan happy.
 Girls, girls, girls.
 Let's save it for Mr.
 Jordan.
 Studio 68 is where we do The Girlie Show.
 Did you all see Tracy Jordan make a special appearance the other night? Wasn't that exciting? That is what we in the show business like to call a "cameo.
" Hey, this is the star of The Girlie Show, Jenna Maroney.
 Hi.
 Thank you.
 How do you feel, NBC tour? 'Cause you look good, like a solid gold candy bar! Where else do you have those piercings on your body? This is it, everybody.
 Here he comes.
 Stop, stop, stop.
 It's only Jenna.
 All right, it's just Jenna.
 How you doing, Jenna? Okay, I mean granted, Tracy Jordan has some commercial appeal, but within his remunenerative body of work there's just nothing of value.
 What are you talking about? Did you ever see his stand-up? Give up the butt, ladies.
 Give up the butt.
 This is it, I mean it.
 Here he comes.
 He's an imbecile.
 Well, he's our imbecile now.
 I'm just surprised he's still got his shirt-- Oh, there it goes.
 Jack! Oh, my goodness! It's good to see you again, brother.
 It's good to see you again.
 Oh, that is fantastic.
 You have to teach me that handshake one day.
 Listen, Tracy, if there's anything you need, anything, you come to me.
 Come on, Jack, you know I'm the kid.
 I'm easy like Sunday morning.
 Don't look at me! Do not look at me in the eyes.
 Do not look at Mr.
 Jordan! Do not look at him in the eye.
 Just look away.
 Look away.
 Tracy, this is our producer, Pete.
 Hey! Hey, Pete.
 You smoke weed, right, Pete? Uh No.
 Yeah, me neither.
 Me and you, Pete.
 Me and you.
 Pete.
 Good to see you.
 Is it? Oh, good.
 It's good to see you too.
 'Cause that means I'm not fired anymore.
 I wasn't gonna mention that.
 But I did.
 And now I'm talking about it.
 Relax your balls, Pete.
 Hey, everybody.
 Tracy Jordan's here.
 Don't just sit there.
 Come and give me some sugar.
 No, thank you.
 Well if you ever want to piss off your parents, you come see me.
 Right this way, Tracy.
 This is Tim Grandy.
 He's from Bowie, Maryland.
 Rachel Baze, she just got engaged.
 Josh Girard, he got 760 on his SATs.
 Graduated from SUNY Courtland.
 Frank Rossitano has every copy of Black Tail magazine ever published.
 J.
D.
 Lutz, thyroid problem.
 James Spurlock, but we call him Toofer, because with him you get a "Two for One," he's a black guy and a Harvard guy.
 And, of course, you know Lemon.
 How did you do that? It's my job.
 Jerry from set design.
 Wally, cue cards.
 Rupert Murdoch.
 Melinda Gates.
 Ziggy  from the cartoon Ziggy.
 Anthony Pellano.
 Heidi Klum.
 The guy that sleeps with Heidi Klum.
 This man's a genius.
 Let me just say, I'm excited to be here.
 It's an honor for you to meet me.
 I've got a lot of characters I'm ready to bust out.
 I got a character named Biscuit.
 Write that up.
 Got a another character named Raylondo, who's a two-foot tall Spanish hustler.
 Glasses, I want you to write that one.
 Got another character named Ching Chong, who loves to play Ping Pong.
 I just made that up right now.
 'Cause that's how I flow.
 Now I'm up for anything.
 I thought me and you could play Seinfeld and Bill Cos-- No.
 I don't like that.
 How you doing? There is no way I am working with that guy! Do you know that he once got arrested for walking naked through LaGuardia? And that he once fell asleep on Ted Danson's roof? Yeah, Tracy has mental health issues-- He bit Dakota Fanning on the face! When you hear his version, she was kind of asking for it.
 I can't even believe that you are doing this to me.
 Listen, I understand that this is tough for you.
 But what did I tell you? Not to freak out? Right.
 And what else? Stop falling in love with gay guys? About this.
 That you're looking out for me.
 But  it doesn't seem-- Jenna, I'm your friend.
 I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
 This show is called The Girlie Show, and you are the girl.
 Nothing is going to change that.
 Okay.
 Glaub mir.
 Diese "Advantium Microwaves" sind die beste.
 How could you change the name of my show without telling me? Detlev, I'm gonna have to call you back.
 Yeah, wunderbar.
 Plowchops.
 The Girlie Show is now T.
G.
S.
 with Tracy Jordan? It tested very well with the focus groups.
 If you say you like it, you can have some pizza.
 You people like pizza? You need to tell Jenna that this whole thing was your idea and that I didn't know anything about it, and that she should be mad at you, not me.
 Oh, sure.
 Then we could sit around and braid each other's hair until we get our periods at the same time.
 Look, Lemon, you're a supervisor.
 These people are not your friends.
 Yes, they are my friends.
 No, they're your employees.
 Well one of my employees is extremely mad at me.
 Will you talk to her? No, because then you're not gonna learn anything.
 You have to manage these people, Lemon.
 It's your show.
 You have the tools.
 Now get out there and build the house, add on a pool, and throw yourself into the deep end.
 What if I can't swim? Then I'll do what my father did when I was two.
 Lure you to the edge of the pool with a puppy, and push you in.
 Yikes.
 Fine, I'll figure it out.
 We're gonna be shooting some promos in an hour underneath the new sign.
 So have your people write some stuff.
 So I said, "Rick, this chick's got an Adam's apple.
" And Rick said to me, I'll never forget this.
 He said, "Freaky deakies need love too.
 Freaky deakies need love too.
" Charming.
 So, how you doing over there, Theo Huxtable? I'm doing good.
 Unh-unh.
 Superman does good.
 You're doing well.
 You need to study your grammar, son.
 Wow.
 That was embarrassing for you.
 I don't even have lines in these promos.
 It's all Tracy he doesn't even mention me.
 I'll fix that.
 Just stay calm.
 Stay calm? They changed the name of the show.
 You said that you were looking out for me.
 I am.
 I will handle it.
 Lemon, Lemon.
 Can I be real with you? Yeah.
 I haven't had a real job in like two years.
 I'm not used to all these-- These cue cards and all of that.
 Don't worry about the cue cards.
 Look, you have two lines.
 Just say, "Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan, I'm bringing the black back to NBC.
" I'm proud as a peacock, baby.
" You  don't even need these.
 You're right.
 I got this! Thanks for looking out for me, Lemon.
 I'm gonna crush it.
 Show these people how a movie star does it.
 A little to your right, Tracy.
 Okay, here we go.
 In three, two-- Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan and I'm bringing the black back to NBC.
 And I'm proud as a peacork, baby.
 That's great, Tracy, but it's peacock.
 What did I say? Peacork.
 Peacock.
 Think peacock.
 Right, Jenna? In three, two-- Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan, and I'm bringing the black back to NBC.
 And I'm proud as a pea cock, baby.
 Okay.
 That time I think you may have hit it a little bit too hard.
 Also, can you throw Jenna's name in there for me? In three, two-- Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan, and I'm bringing the black back to NBC.
 Right, Jenna Mulvaney? Maroney.
 Rhymes with Baloney.
 Here we go.
 In three, two-- Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan, and I'm bringing the black back to NBC.
 And I'm proud as a peacock.
 Right, Mabaloney? Nope.
 In three, two-- Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan.
 I'm black, NBC.
 Very proud, like peacocks.
 Right, Janet? I think we got it.
 I think we got it.
 Yeah, I think we did.
 Okay, that was beyond insulting.
 The guy doesn't even know my name.
 Why do you love him so much? No, no, no, no! I don't love him.
 Donaghy loves him.
 That's it.
 Pete can't stand him, Toofer thinks he's an idiot.
 Even Cerie says he's a pig.
 Frank likes his movies.
 Frank also loves that video of the monkey smelling his own butt.
 Mmm.
 Nobody wants Tracy Jordan here except for certified non-genius Jack Donaghy.
 Sorry  to interrupt, Ms.
 Maroney, but the sound guys want their microphone back.
 So everyone can? Hear everything you are saying.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Oh my God.
 I didn't use the N word, did I? Oh, no, no, no, Miss Maroney, you did not.
 Oh, good.
 I mean, I never would, but, you know-- Jenna, take the mic off! Sorry.
 Oh, my God.
 That was bad, right? It wasn't great.
 Jack Donaghy wants to see you.
 No, no, no.
 Tell him I'm very busy.
 Come in, she's very busy.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, I sincerely apologize.
 I'm so embarrassed.
 I guess you must be embarrassed if you're hiding in the storage closet.
 This is my office.
 Really? I see you bring a little feminine magic to everything you touch.
 How did it go with Tracy Jordan when you apologized? I didn't think I needed to talk to him.
 I mean, he's not my friend, he's my employee.
 No, he's not your employee, he's your product.
 Like it or not, you're in the Tracy Jordan business now.
 And when you screw the pooch the way you did today, it's your responsibility to get in there and make things right.
 How do I do that? I don't know.
 I'm a non-genius.
 I'm really sorry! Lunch break, that's a lunch break.
 Back in 30 minutes.
 Tracy, I hope I didn't hurt your feelings before.
 Please.
 You can't hurt me.
 I did stand-up on the road.
 A crowd once threw a motorcycle at me.
 Good, 'cause, you know, I'm just trying to calm Jenna down.
 'Cause she's kinda paranoid and neurotic, and your being is just bringing out all of her crazy.
 Please don't think that everyone hates you.
 Pete thinks that everybody's an idiot.
 Especially Frank, who is an idiot.
 Josh is just jealous 'cause you're gonna get more screen time than him.
 And Toofer's just afraid of black people.
 Which one is Toofer? The black guy.
 Oh.
 My point is, don't worry about them.
 You are the only person that the network cares about.
 Ms.
 Lemon? I just wanted to let you know y'all are on the monitors right now.
 Everyone can-- Hear you and see you.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Son of a mother! Paranoid? Well, that just confirms all my suspicions.
 Sorry, everybody.
 Hey, buddies.
 All right, I deserve that.
 But I didn't say anything about you guys that I wouldn't have said to your faces.
 Fine.
 The important thing is don't take this out on Tracy-- That dude sucks! Okay, are we going to talk about this like adults, or are you just gonna throw things at me? All right.
 Okay, fine.
 Get it out of your system.
 Nothing that plugs in, you guys! Nothing that could really hurt me! Hello.
 Lemon.
 How are things in the deep end? Fine.
 The staff is meshing together well? Oh, yes, yeah.
 Good.
 I'm counting on you.
 We got to do something.
 Let's crash my car to see if the air-bags go off.
 Let me explain what I'm talking about first.
 Everybody is mad.
 At us.
 Mostly mad at you.
 Yeah, well, that's because Donaghy threw me into the deep end of a pool that I didn't even want to build in the first place! Look, I'm just saying, we both screwed up today.
 I think we should make nice and buy everybody some pizza and some soft drinks-- Nah, nah, nah.
 This is what we're gonna do, Lemon.
 You're going to get everybody on my yacht.
 Harbor cruise.
 Drinks.
 Togetherness.
 That's great.
 You have a yacht? I got a yacht.
 I got a solid gold jet-ski.
 Two Batmobiles.
 The AIDS monkey's bones Welcome! Welcome to your fantasy! We're both hosting.
 The ice cream bar was my idea.
 This is surprisingly tasteful.
 Oh, yeah.
 I've taken this boat many places.
 Miami, Tokyo, Denver.
 What does that mean, Avanti Domani? What? The name of the boat.
 Oh, that's Spanish for "remember your mother.
" No, I don't think it is.
 Hello, boys.
 I brought champagne.
 I'm so glad you came.
 Get away from me.
 My Baloney! Look at you.
 Wow.
 Yeah, thanks.
 Let me make you a drink.
 You love apple martinis, right? Yes, how did you know that? I read your interview in Amtrak Magazine.
 Really? You saw that? Mm-hmm.
 Wow.
 Did you know that all the writers in that magazine are also conductors? I didn't know that.
 Hey, Toofer, see if I got any schnapps.
 Good gravy.
 This is a Dunwoody '62.
 It's for you.
 Take it, my friend.
 Thank you.
 That is just wasteful.
 I  hear you sing.
 I didn't know that.
 Why don't you sing something for me? Oh, no.
 Nobody wants to hear that.
 I do.
 Some folks like to get away, take a holiday from the neighborhood Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood Let's get out of here.
 Is that a real song? It's going well, right? It has to, it has to go well.
 Relax, everybody's having a great time.
 How's Jenna? Furious and drunk.
 But at least she's getting along with Tracy.
 Well, he does know how to throw a party.
 Think we're ever gonna leave the dock? I don't know.
 The engines haveeen running for like three hours.
 Hey, hey! Grizz! Grizz, don't wreck this boat! Grizz is driving the boat? Don't worry.
 He was in the Navy.
 I got one, I got one.
 Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby! What's the deal with pudding? I'm Bill Cosby.
 Jell-o! Sweaters! Whoo! Yeah! That doesn't even sound like the Cos.
 I'm gotta go lay down.
 Got you on that one, man.
 He got you again, man.
 Get better references.
 Tracy, thank you so much for doing this.
 You totally saved me.
 You don't have to thank me, Lemon.
 We're a team now.
 Like Batman and Robin.
 Like chicken and a chicken container.
 Hey, where's your bathroom? Second door on the right.
 All right, let's do another one.
 That's weird.
 Por favor, no me dueles.
 Me llamo María.
 What? Please calling Ted and Nancy Peabody.
 You tell Who Dat Ninja is on the boat.
 What are you saying? Tracy Jordan is on the boat.
 He no see me.
 I hidden from him.
 I hide from him.
 Oh, my God.
 It's Spanish for, "Remember Your Mother.
" I've taken this boat to Denver.
 You can have that scotch.
 Grizz was in the Navy! It's not his boat! Sir, you need to disembark immediately.
 This is not his boat! We gotta get off this thing! This is not his boat! Disembark immediately.
 Is this your boat? Disembark immediately.
 Run! Jump! Get out of here! Good morning.
 Morning.
 Okay, you were right.
 I'm sorry? I can't do this.
 I can't manage these people.
 It was a disaster.
 What are you talking about? Everybody loved your little Lemon party.
 I think it brings the team together like a harrowing experience.
 You pulled it off.
 Really? They bonded.
 Good job.
 Okay.
 I guess now I just have to read about how Tracy Jordan tried to steal a boat.
 No, I took care of that.
 The Peabodys will be getting some free rides on the NBC jet.
 There won't be anything in the papers at all.
 Really? What about this? Well, I had to give them something.
 Ugh.
 Don't worry.
 She's gonna love it.
 That's just insulting.
 Liz, Liz, did you see me in the Post? Oh, my God, it's so embarrassing.
 Look how thin I look.
 And look how many emails I've gotten.
 It's not even Should I call Stern? You're welcome.
   

                




                    			Now, Robot, kick 'em in the knees.
 Bears have weak knees.
 And you should vibrate, 'cause the robot's full of radiation.
 Yeah, that's it.
 Frank.
 How many bears did I say you could have? One.
 And how many do you see here? Um, four? Save a little money for the rest of us, Frank.
 You can't spend a bunch of money on bear suits that are only gonna be seen for, like, 25 seconds.
 Liz, nobody's gonna believe that a killer robot can get his ass kicked by one bear.
 It doesn't make any sense.
 You're trying to bring logic to the robot-bear sketch? You can't have four bears.
 Well, how many can I keep? One! Sorry, guys.
 Uh, who did my Sudoku puzzle? I have been looking forward to this puzzle all morning.
 Hey, Liz, could you come up to my office when you have a free moment? I never have a free moment, Jack.
 Never, ever.
 Really punch him.
 Like karate.
 Are you familiar with the Japanese art of Reiki? No.
 It is the laying-on of hands in order to improve one's life.
 Hm, how does your life improve? Do the hands have money in them? Human contact is important, Lemon.
 I can tell from your stress level that you have not been touched in any way in quite some time.
 Not caress?? Not massaged.
 Not even groped on the subway.
 Where are you headed with this? Your mood affects the quality of your work, which, in turn, affects me.
 I would like to become a resource to you for improving your personal life.
 Do you agree that you need someone in your life, Lemon? No, I have bigger things to worry about than my personal life.
 I would think that a single woman's biggest worry would be choking to death alone in her apartment.
 I have a friend in town I'd like to set you up with.
 No, thank you.
 Thomas is very bright, has a wonderful sense of humor.
 I think it's a good match.
 Are you free on Thursday? No, Thursday is poker night.
 And by the way, it is completely inappropriate for you to be questioning me about my private life, and then trying to set me up with someone when you don't even know anything about me.
 Poker night? Who plays? Really? That's all you got out of that? I enjoy poker, and I'd be interested in seeing my new employees under that kind of pressure.
 You're not gonna come to our crappy poker game, are you? No, I'm not.
 Good.
 I bluffed.
 Yes, I am coming.
 Three can't go here.
 Three can't go here.
 It can go here.
 Fine, I'll meet your friend.
 So who is this Thomas guy? Oh, I don't know.
 He's one of Jack's friends.
 Oh, my God, isn't Jack friends with Tom DeLay? Am I going on a date with Tom DeLay? Ugh, why did I say I would do this? I haven't been on a date since Dennis and I broke up, and that was almost a year ago.
 It's gonna be a complete disaster.
 It's just one date.
 But if it is Tom DeLay and you do go home with him, be prepared for it to get weird.
 Josh, you and me.
 Thursday night.
 I know this guy that runs an underground bird fight.
 Oh, yeah.
 I can't do that.
 Thursday's poker night here.
 Guys, we just need to try the green screen stuff one more time.
 Poker night? I love poker.
 I used to play all kinds of poker with my aunt.
 Crazy Seven.
 Albuquerque Freakout.
 One Card Stud.
 Yeah, I don't think those are real games.
 Whatever.
 Get ready to get took.
 No, Mom, I can't make it Friday.
 I gotta work.
 Hey, Frank? Hold on.
 Yeah.
 What do guys like? Uh, porn.
 No, I mean, if you were gonna go on a date with a woman, how would you want her to act? Like she was in a porn.
 Hey, Lemon.
 You're on for 8:00 for dinner at Café des Artistes.
 Really? Wow.
 What? What are you gonna wear? This, probably.
 I don't have time to go home.
 No,  that won't do.
 I want you to go out on your lunch hour, and find something.
 At a women's clothing store.
 Remind me what's better.
 A pair of black Aces or a pair of red Aces? You guys, I'm leaving.
 All right.
 All right.
 Check out the valley.
 Look at that.
 Hey, look at you! You look like a fancy prostitute.
 Okay, I got my chair.
 I got my beer.
 I got my lucky donut.
 Oh, is there room for one more? Yeah, sure.
 Really? That's fantastic.
 Could we just, uh-- Yes, yes, yes.
 Donaghy, what up? What up, Tray? This round, Texas Doozy.
 Face cards are wild.
 Threes are jinx.
 Fives are twos.
 Tray, do you mind if I deal this hand? Be my guest.
 Show me love.
 Ladies and gentlemen, the minimum bet in this game is $25.
 Oh, Jack, we usually just play for quarters.
 Well, then you best go home and put on your daddy's shoes, boy.
 'Cause this is a man's game.
 I call.
 And I'll see that with This thing.
 I call.
 Pair of Jacks.
 Ace high.
 Three cowboys.
 Oh, my God.
 My wedding ring.
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, my God.
 Now, you should all learn from Pete's mistake.
 My  wife's gonna kill me! You see, in poker as in business, the key to success is to determine your opponent's strength and, more importantly, his weaknesses.
 Everyone has a tell-- a weakness of character that manifests itself physically.
 Oh.
 Like when Lutz here has a good hand, he stops eating.
 When Frank is bluffing, he asks a series of insane questions to hide his nervousness.
 Oh, really? Is that what you think? Is that what I do? Am I doing that right now? Yeah, I'm out.
 Okay, Rainman, tell me what I got.
 Well, you have two of your cards backwards actually.
 I'm out.
 Hi.
 Pinot grigio, please.
 This is beyond the pale.
 Donaghy took me for $200.
 Yeah, well I bet my rent money.
 And if I don't pay by the tenth, my mom's gonna throw me out.
 I'm all in.
 Anybody else? Oh, I'll play with you, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Kenneth, how long you been sitting there? I'm taking Pete's place, 'cause he's busy in the bathroom, laying in his own sick.
 Oh, my God.
 He can't read Kenneth.
 He's a blank slate.
 Okay, what do you got? I think I have what they refer to as a royal flush.
 Looks like I'm the big winner.
 Thank you.
 Liz, hi.
 I'm Gretchen Thomas.
 Jack's friend.
 Hey.
 Great to meet you.
 Hi.
 Why would Jack just assume that we're lesbians? I am a lesbian.
 Mm, that's awesome.
 Is this the first time somebody's made that assumption about you? Lemon, don't let these girls give you a hard time about who you are.
 You know, you need to brush your teeth more, young man.
 Oh, my.
 What an adorable little lesbian.
 What? I don't know.
 Who remembers that kind of thing? Well, look, obviously this is a miscommunication.
 I mean, I'm certainly not interested in chasing a straight girl.
 Of course, yeah.
 I completely understand if you just want to go home.
 No, it's fine.
 I'll stay.
 Jack is ridiculous.
 Oh, I worked with Jack in Plastics.
 He tends to approach everything the same way.
 Locate the problem.
 Isolate the problem.
 Set the problem up with a lesbian.
 That's a pretty good joke for somebody from Plastics.
 Well, I wasn't always in Plastics.
 I used to work in Water and Process Technologies.
 Working mainly in primary metals.
 Oh, so you have a comedy background.
 How was your evening with Thomas? You mean, Gretchen Thomas? The brilliant plastics engineer/lesbian? What made you think I was gay? Your shoes.
 Well, I'm straight.
 Those shoes are definitely bi-curious.
 Regardless, I am straight.
 Well, I'm sorry if I offended you.
 No, I'm not offended-- Good.
 What do you know about Kenneth the page? I don't know.
 He's a sweet kid.
 Yes.
 And  a surprisingly good poker player.
 Did you know that his middle name is Ellen? No, that's weird.
 And that his Myers-Briggs-psychological testing shows shows a rare combination of extroverted, intuitive and aggressive? Really? The same as mine.
 He could be trouble down the line.
 Kenneth.
 Kenneth Ellen.
 All right then.
 You're not a lesbian.
 Duly noted.
 I'll correct that on your file.
 It's too bad, though.
 Thomas thought you were great.
 She did? Yes.
 She said she thought you looked like Jennifer Jason Leigh.
 Really? She said that? Yes, I made her repeat it.
 I was sure she meant Jason Lee.
 Miss Lemon.
 Yeah.
 This is Pete's wedding ring.
 I won it last night, but I don't think I should keep it.
 Could you give it back to him for me? Yeah, okay.
 Did you win this, too? I did.
 I love how the light catches it like diamonds.
 Kenneth, it is diamonds.
 Ah.
 Hi, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Can I help you with something? You are a puzzle Kenneth Ellen.
 And I'm going to solve you.
 Yes, I am.
 I can't believe you bet your wedding ring.
 I know.
 The weird thing is I had money left.
 Hey, um, what famous person would you say I look like? Uh, present day Linda Ronstadt.
 No, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
 Tootsie.
 Never mind.
 So how was your date? It wasn't a good match.
 What happened? Did he notice your facial tic? No.
 Did you wear sandals? Did he see your toes? No.
 You  blew it, didn't you? Good job, Liz.
 Way to go.
 Another one bites the dust.
 Ah, look at your little face.
 It was a lady.
 Are you serious? Where is my Emmy? Hello? Hi, Gretchen.
 It's Liz Lemon.
 Oh, hi.
 Look, thiss gonna sound really weird, but, um, do you every worry about choking to death alone in your apartment? Oh, it's so weird you would say that.
 I think about it all the time.
 I mean, you'd die, and they wouldn't find you until your neighbor's dog smelled you from the hallway.
 Ugh, yes, and they'd show a picture of you on New York One.
 And it's not just choking.
 Ever since I turned 30, every time I get in or out of the bathtub, I think in my head, "Careful, careful.
" Yes! Agh.
 Everything's the worst.
 Do you want to get some dinner? Sure.
 See you in 20 at Neptune.
 Yeah, okay.
 Perfect, yeah.
 Oh! Ow, ow, ow! I did not die.
 Man, this is amazing.
 Oh, hey, Jack.
 Welcome.
 Welcome, everybody.
 Damn, Jack, you went all out.
 That's a giant shrimp.
 Made out of shrimp and diving into a bowl of shrimp.
 Please, enjoy it, Tracy.
 Hey, Pete, good to see you.
 Jack.
 Is Kenneth here? I--I will check.
 I've been playing for two hours.
 I'm tired of losing.
 I'm gonna let my boy, Dotcom, play a hand for me.
 So, hey, Dotcom, are we going to those three clubs tonight? You know the doctor said I have four hearts in my body? All right.
 Great.
 Of course he did.
 Come on.
 Damn it.
 Hey, everybody, this is Gretchen.
 Oh, hey.
 Oh, Thomas.
 Jack.
 How's everybody up there in Pittsfield? Oh, we miss you.
 I love this woman.
 Let's play some poker.
 I call.
 What have you got, Kenneth? All clovers.
 I win.
 Very clever boy, Kenneth.
 But the curtain has been drawn back now, and I know the real you.
 I think he's confusing me with someone else.
 Liz, are you sure you're not gay? 'Cause that chick is hot.
 We're just friends, like Oprah and Gayle.
 Why is that so hard for everybody to believe? She's great.
 You should marry that girl.
 One problem.
 I'm not gay.
 Oh, Lemon, in the ten years that I've known you, you've had some really terrible boyfriends.
 I have.
 There was the guy who was obsessed with Charlie Chaplin.
 Neil.
 There was the guy who played Halo under the name Slutbanger.
 Dennis.
 There was a tall, gangly, red-haired guy who played guitar all the time.
 Conan.
 You're more relaxed with Gretchen than you were with any of those guys.
 So what are you saying, Pete? I should just be a lesbian? Well, I'm not saying it'll be easy.
 You know, get drunk first.
 Why do guys think women can just flip a switch like that? What if I said to you, "Go be with Frank now"? Ah, I would be honored.
 Frank is a very tender, beautiful man.
 He's awesome.
 You can't read his thoughts, 'cause he doesn't have any.
 I raise you 200.
 And I see your 200 and raise you 300.
 Will you, little Kenneth Ellen Parcell from Stone Mountain, Georgia? Growing up in your momma's tract house, dreaming of working on a TV show? Dreaming of making it all the way to the NBC.
 You're scaring me, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 You've come a long way, haven't you, Kenneth Ellen? With your cheap loafers and your page jacket, but you'll always be a pig farmer's son, boy.
 'Cause I smell fried bologna all over you.
 I'm all in.
 I'm out of chips, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Hey, I got a fun idea.
 You put your page jacket on the table, and if you win, you can get it back.
 If you lose, you go on home.
 You go on home, little Kenneth Ellen.
 All the way to Stone Mountain.
 He's bluffing.
 Go for it.
 He's bluffing.
 Come on, trust yourself.
 Trust yourself.
 Don't do it.
 No! You can do it.
 Okay, okay.
 Come on.
 Use your instincts.
 You've got good instincts.
 Do it, Kenneth.
 I've got a pair of twos.
 Well, let's just see-weeby here.
 I've got a two, a four, a nine, a six, and a King.
 That means I win.
 Kenneth.
 Why did you bet that terrible hand? Why? BecauseI believe that life is for the living.
 I believe in taking risks and biting off more than you can chew.
 And also, people were yelling, and I got confused about the rules.
 Kenneth.
 I wasn't really going to fire you.
 I  just wanted to remind you that I could.
 I want you back here at 6:00 in the morning sharp so you can sweep up these shrimp tails.
 Yes, sir, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Uh, I'm gonna have my eye on you, Kenneth.
 You will not be disappointed, sir.
 Well, it was nice of you to let him keep his job.
 The Italians have a saying, Lemon.
 "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
" And although they've never won a war, or mass-produced a decent car, in this area, they are correct.
 In five years, we'll all either be working for him or be dead by his hand.
 Hey, after Ikea tomorrow, you wanna go see Margaret Cho at the Beacon? Oh, boy.
 Um, Oprah? Yes, Gayle.
 I think we need to take a break.
 Is this because I waused to submit us for The Amazing Race? Because I was 80% joking about that.
 No, it's-- You know, I said I'm not into chasing straight girls.
 And I kinda think that's what's starting to happen here.
 So unless you're ready to make a big life change, I need to move on, find my Steadman.
 I thought I was Oprah in this metaphor.
 Also, you're gay, so that's a little confusing.
 You should say, like, "My lady Steadman.
" Okay.
 I'm going out on a limb here.
 Okay, sorry.
 Um, it's just-- If I try to imagine us being together, I think, "Yeah, okay, this could be fun, you know? "Picking out furniture and making flower beds out of old railroad ties.
" But the thing is, if I'm gonna be with someone, it has to be a guy.
 You sound pretty sure about that.
 What can I say? I love a bald spot and a hairy back.
 You're alone there.
 I should go.
 I'll see you around.
 Okay, wait.
 Um, what if we made a pact? What if we say that in, like, 25 years, if neither of us has someone, we'll move in together and be roommates.
 And even though I am not into the sex stuff, if it helps you I would let you do stuff to me.
 I can't be around you anymore.
 Bye, Liz.
 That's funny.
 That's what the guys always say.
 Who's gonna go with me to cooking class next weekend? Well, if by "cooking class" you mean your bed, and by "next weekend" you mean tonight-- Oh, shut up.
 I can see your wedding ring.
 Idiot.
   

                




                    			All right, we have a lot to get through today, you guys.
 Anybody have anything on page one? I think we need to change this Donald Trump joke-- because Donald Trump was eaten by a lion this morning on the International Space Station.
 Anyone listening? Yeah, okay, Cerie, how about instead of doing the scripts, why don't you just organize those videotapes? Oh, okay.
 Okay, actually, could you go downstairs and get me a chai tea? Okay.
 Um, where are my shoes? No, no, just go.
 Just go barefoot! Just leave you shoes.
 Okay.
 We gotta change this Trump joke.
 Mr.
 Jordan.
 What's up, Ken? I got your car washed like you asked.
 And I got that "Baby on Board" sign you wanted to help you get tail.
 Thanks, Ken.
 You done good.
 It's my pleasure and my job, sir.
 Anything you ever need, just ask.
 But I want you to know something.
 You and me, it's not gonna be a one-way street.
 'Cause I don't believe in one-way streets.
 Not between people and not while I'm driving.
 Oh, okay.
 So here's some advice I wish I would've got when I was your age.
 Live every week like it's Shark Week.
 Excellent call, guys.
 Good old Stan there.
 Happy Birthday, Stan.
 All right, we're halfway done.
 Let's take a little break.
 You guys want to have a one-minute dance party? Good idea.
 Crank it, Toofer.
 * Grown and sexy from your head down to your toes * * You know you're fine * Got that perfect face, a perfect shape * * And perfect smile Yeah, shake it! Feel the music.
 Ahem! Oh, Mr.
 Donaghy! No, please finish your dance.
 Oh, we were just taking a little break.
 And we all love the music of Chamillionaire.
 I see.
 If you don't mind, I'll just observe from over here.
 You will? Why? Are you familiar with Six Sigma? Oh, yeah, it's a special kind of G.
I.
 Joe.
 It's Frank, right? Yes, sir.
 Yeah.
 Frank Six Sigma is the elite GE executive training course.
 To master just its basic concepts, one must brave a five-day conference at a Sheraton.
 Six Sigma says that a manager must understand every aspect of the business he or she oversees.
 Which means? I'll be in here every day.
 Soaking it up.
 So please return to work, and act like I'm not here.
 Okay.
 Let's, uh, get into Toofer's commercial parody.
 We were trying to think of a funnier cereal name.
 The favorite options so far include Honey Bunches of Sadness, Oat Bung, and Swaztik-o's.
 Fruit Lupus.
 No.
 Dingleberries.
 Fart Nuggets.
 I'm sorry.
 That's really great.
 Okay, let's just think for another minute.
 Frosted Mini Guns.
 Lucky Bastards? If you don't mind, I think we all really laughed at Fart Nuggets, so could we just move on, please.
 Every day, huh? You guys want coffee? Oh, yeah.
 So I was doing some research on comedy.
 And I came across the cartoon strip Dilbert.
 It's quite good.
 And I was wondering if we could do that.
 Do what? Dilbert.
 You guys want coffee? Oh, yeah.
 No, no, no, you can't say that.
 Jeb Bush is a friend of mine.
 Who should I change it to? Sean Penn-- No, Barbra Streisand.
 He guns it.
 Girl falls into the water.
 You guys want coffee? So we circle back looking for her.
 Remember, it's pitch black out.
 The boat hits something hard.
 And you hear kind of And Brokaw says, "Just go.
 Don't look back.
" NowI'm not a writer, but maybe there's a skit in that.
 Hey.
 What? So is Donaghy gonna be in the room again today? Ugh.
 Probably, yeah.
 Well, you have to say something to him.
 You  guys are not getting any work done.
 Really? You don't think his idea of starting with the catchphrases and working backwards is panning out? "Nuts to you, McGullicuty.
" "Who ordered the wieners?" Beep beep! Ribby ribby! Actually, Frank wrote a draft of "Beep beep, ribby ribby.
" Look, you have to say something to Jack soon, or your writers are going to revolt.
 What do you all not understand? He's our boss.
 Me trying to tell Jack what to do would be like you trying to boss around-- Which one of your kids is it that you're afraid of? Kyle.
 Kyle.
 So strong.
 Oh, come on! That was a jacket.
 That's it, I've gotta talk to her about her clothes.
 She can't dress like that.
 Yes, she can.
 People like the way she dresses.
 Oh, come on, it's distracting.
 It's inappropriate.
 You're inappropriate, you jerk, with your big stupid face! Come on.
 Liz, listen, listen, listen.
 Look at me.
 Look how bald I am.
 Look at my life.
 Please, just give me this one thing.
 Pete, no, come on! I'm talking to her.
 Talk to yourself! Cha! Kenny, my boy.
 What's the frequency, Ken? Yeah, I need you to grab me some lunch.
 Absolutely.
 What can I get for you? I want nachos.
 Yes, sir.
 From Yankee Stadium.
 Yes, sir! General  testing for United Nations Bloopers.
 Oh, hey, Cerie.
 Kind of need to talk to you about something.
 Do you have a second? Sure.
 Okay, this is gonna sound really weird, but, umyou need to wear a bra.
 Oh, no, I don't actually.
 They kind of just stay up on their own.
 See? Yeah, okay.
 What I'm saying is, you need to wear a bra to work if you want to be taken seriously in this business.
 No, but I don't actually want to work in television.
 Career-wise, I'm just gonna marry rich and then design handbags.
 Here's the thing.
 The way that you dress is making some people around the office uncomfortable.
 Really? Who? Not me! I guess it's mostly me that has the problem with it.
 Oh, because you have, like, one of those body image things? No, it's not that.
 Good, because I was gonna say you still have a good body.
 Well, thank you, but this isn't about me.
 Like, how did you dress before you were married? I'm not married, Cerie.
 Oh, for some reason, I thought you had, like, three kids.
 Nope.
 Never married, no kids.
 'Cause sometimes you have, like, food stains on your shirt and stuff.
 I just assumed that it was kids.
 You know what? Forget I mentioned it.
 You look great.
 Is it my birthday? You have to get Donaghy out of the room.
 Boy, we as a group might not smell great.
 Come on, he's stifling us.
 I feel like I just can't be myself around him.
 Yeah, Tracy's downstairs right now rehearsing the best thing we've written all week.
 Beep beep! Ribby ribby! All right.
 Ugh.
 All right.
 I'll take care of it.
 Thanks, Liz.
 Hey, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Sorry I'm late.
 I was at a luncheon for Ann Coulter's 60th birthday.
 Oh, yeah.
 Listen, it's been really great having you in the room these last few days-- Oh, it's been great for me, too.
 Being around all this creativity.
 I'll tell you, in the beginning I thought it was gonna be a bit of a chore honestly, but now-- Oh, I have an idea for you.
 Monkey Senate.
 We open on the Capitol-- You can't be in here anymore! What's that? It's not working.
 You're driving everybody crazy.
 And, okay, you can just fire me now, and I will go back to teaching improv to senior citizens.
 Why would I want to fire you? This is fine.
 Six Sigma values direct and honest communication between coworkers, so, uh Thank you, Liz.
 Oh, sure.
 I'll just, uh, head upstairs now.
 Okay, well, thank you for being so understanding.
 Absolutely.
 Oh, no.
 I will not let you down, sir.
 Go get help, girl.
 Hey, Jonathan, I left a bunch of messages for Jack, but I haven't heard back.
 Do you know if he got them? Mr.
 Donaghy's been very busy.
 Well, I just--I really need him to approve this budget.
 Well, I'm sorry.
 He's out of the country till the end of the week.
 You  want to know another key to success? I do, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Dress every day like you're gonna get murdered in those clothes.
 You did real good the other day with those nachos, but I need you to do something of a different nature.
 Would you agree when I say that a man's freedom only exists when he's free to pursue his desires? Yes, I suppose I would.
 Which means when the law conflicts with our desires, then we must operate outside the law.
 You following me? Otherwise, we would no longer be free.
 Now I got a mission for you.
 Hey, Liz! I took your advice.
 I'm wearing a bra.
 That's great, Cerie.
 Uh, Liz, can I speak to you for a second? Sure.
 What's going on? Mr.
 Donaghy is very upset that you banned him from the writers' room.
 He wants you to apologize.
 Really? But when you apologize, you have to act like it was your idea.
 He can't know that I told you.
 But he sent you here to tell me to apologize.
 Exactly.
 I penciled you in for 3:00.
 This conversation never happened.
 Jenna, set yourself, please, for Who Wants to Eat a Dictionary? Where's Kenneth? Who is it? It's Kenneth from the NBC page program.
 I'm here for a pickup from Qiang Deng.
 Hello, gentlemen.
 Oh, thank goodness.
 Air conditioning.
 Ooh, what does that tattoo mean? When I get nervous, I ask a lot of questions.
 Do y'all have a bathroom I could use? Y'all have long fingernails.
 Now do y'all rent this space, or do you own it? Hey, that's a funny-looking fish.
 What is that, like a grapefruit knife? Do you have a cell phone? What's your plan? This apology thing is interesting.
 Ugh, even when it's something normal I hate going up to Jack's office.
 I always feel like I'm entering the Death Star.
 I expect to see Stormtroopers.
 I tell you, if Donaghy does this at me, I  will run.
 You'll be fine Captain Needa.
 No, Captain Needa dies.
 He dies! * There's no business like show business * * Like no business I know * Everything about it is appealing * * Everything the traffic will allow * * Nowhere can you get that special feeling * * Than when you're stealing that extra bow * What can I do for you? I'm on a helicopter in 15 minutes.
 Uh, well, sir, I just wanted to say, um, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings the other day when I asked you to stay out of the writers' room.
 That's absurd.
 Completely unnecessary.
 I haven't given it a second thought.
 Okay, good, 'cause, you know, the writers, they see you as management-- Please, it's water under the bridge.
 Stop worrying and just go on back to work.
 Of course, I can understand how you might think my feelings were hurt.
 No one wants to hear that people don't like you.
 What, no? No, that's not at all what I was saying before.
 I never said that people don't like you.
 That's not true.
 So, people do like me? Yes, people like you.
 Do you like me? Of course.
 I like you.
 Jack.
 You know what I like about you? Mmm.
 Your eyes.
 You have those black shark's eyes.
 You know? Very intense.
 Thank you.
 Anyway You done good, kid.
 That thing ever goes missing and gets into the public water system, we don't know each other.
 Got it.
 I got one little errand for you to run.
 Tomorrow's my anniversary, and I almost forgot about it.
 But what did I tell you was the secret to having a good marriage and keeping it together, Kenneth? Be a good listener, a giver of gifts, and work that va-jay-jay.
 That's my boy! That's why I want you to go see my jeweler.
 Good morning, Liz.
 Oh, hi, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 How are you? Fine, thank you.
 I remember you mentioning what a big fan you are of the rapper Chamillionaire.
 'Cause I was dancing with Frank? Oh, yes, yeah.
 I love Chamillionaire.
 Well, it just so happens that he's performing this weekend at Webster Hall, and I got some VIP tickets and backstage passes.
 You could take the writers or a lady friend.
 Whatever.
 Enjoy yourself.
 You deserve it.
 Wow.
 Thank you.
 That's very thoughtful.
 Well, I think that coworkers should have good personal relationships.
 I know we've had some missteps, but we've put all that behind us.
 And I'd like us to be friendly.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 Yes, so do I.
 Wow, I just can't believe Chamillionaire tickets were still available.
 Ah, well.
 See ya.
 Josh to stage, please, for Homophobic Hague.
 What was that about? Just talking to my "bud," Jack Donaghy.
 Bud, really? Yes, he said he wants us to be friends.
 He gave me Chamillionaire tickets.
 And he even did this to me.
 Wow, look, having Jack on your side can only make life easier.
 It's good for everybody if he wants to be friends.
 I know, but it's so weird.
 It's like that scene where you see the back of Darth Vader's head with his helmet off, and you're like, "Oh! He's a human being!" I gotta get some new DVDs.
 Did we just go in a circle? Yeah.
 I was following you.
 I was following you.
 No, I'm going to wardrobe.
 Okay, good walk and talk.
 Lee, can I check costumes for the cold open? That looks fierce.
 Hey, Liz.
 Cerie, seriously, take that off.
 And you, stop encouraging her.
 You're an enabler.
 You need to dress like you have a job.
 And parents who raised you in some kind of shamed-based American religious tradition.
 Here.
 I can make this hot.
 Now I get to pick out what I think you'd look good in.
 Oh, I'm not really a fashion person.
 You're wearing this.
 Come on, no.
 I'm serious.
 This color would be amazing on you.
 And you're a size four, right? Well, aren't you sweet? Hey, guys, what's up? Ugh! Oh, my God! What are you wearing?! You're making me gay.
 It's a joke, obviously.
 I'm wearing this as a joke! Bunch of comedy writers don't know a joke, jeez.
 I just threw up in my mouth.
 I said it's a joke! Work it, Craig! Whoo! I think I'm having a heart attack.
 Excellent, right here.
 Thank you.
 Oh, pizza! Thank you, sir.
 Hey, Liz, can we eat this out on the roof gardens? I don't even know how to get out there.
 I don't think people are allowed out there.
 No, I see Today Show people eating out there all the time.
 Really? Even Ann Curry? I'll show you the studio in just a minute, but first, this is where my writers write.
 Don't mind the odor.
 But seriously, since Tracy's arrival the show is up in the key demos.
 We're driving male viewership, and we're effectively synergizing backward overflow.
 Please, Liz, let us eat outside.
 You know what? I'll ask Jack.
 He'll  let us eat out there, right? He and I have an important friendship.
 Hey, they didn't bring any sodas.
 I'll call Kenneth.
 Seriously, where is Kenneth? Happy anniversary, Mrs.
 Jordan.
 Excuse me, do y'all just have noodles with butter? Hey, Jack! Sorry to interrupt.
 Hey, can we eat our pizza outside? 'Cause those wangs from the Today Show eat on the roof garden all the time, and, you know, since I thought me and you are best buds--boink! Maybe you could do me a solid and slip me the key to that thing.
 This guy's the best.
 He got me kick-ass Chamillionaire tickets.
 You guys like Chamillionaire? Anyway, Jack rocks.
 This guy, A-plus.
 Excuse me for a moment.
 I'm sorry for what's about to happen right now.
 Just know that I don't mean it.
 Don't mean what? What group home did you escape from that you would dare talk to me like some plumber's wife in front of Ron Gordon and Bob Overmeyer? I don't even know who those guys are.
 Oh, really? Your ignorance was obvious when you waddled up to me with your thin-lipped mouth full of greasy peasant food and addressed me by my Christian name in front of the gentlemen from Fairfield.
 That's Fairfield, Connecticut, Lemon.
 GE Headquarters.
 But how would you know that with your nigh-40 years of public education and daytime television viewing? If you ever pull a bush league stunt like that again, I'm gonna have you writing promos for Arena Football so fast it'll make your inexplicably small head spin.
 Oh, snap.
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
 I thought you said we were friends.
 I said we were friendly.
 Well, I don't like you anymore.
 I don't believe you.
 Go easy on the pizza.
   

                




                    			/Tracy Jordan to the stage, please.
 /Tracy to the stage.
 Hey, hey, hey, where are you going? They've been paging you for rehearsal! Rehearsal? We did a show last week.
 I just came to pick up a paycheck.
 No.
 We do a show every Friday, Tracy.
 It's not gonna work.
 Next Friday is Damon Dash's birthday party.
 And the Friday after that there's an orgy over at Elizabeth Hasselbeck's.
 Yeah? Well, you're part of a team now, okay? So you have to be in the shows and you have to rehearse.
 And when you rehearse, Jenna would really like it-- I would like it too-- if you would read exactly what's on the cue cards.
 It's making everybody crazy.
 Can't do it.
 I'm an improviser.
 My acting style is like jazz.
 Jazz that you laugh at.
 "Ah ha ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha ha!" Just try, okay? I have a meeting upstairs.
 I'll be right back.
 Pete.
 Do you remember that song I recorded last year when I was dating that Persian record producer? Ohno.
 It's a dance-pop techno hybrid called Muffin Top.
 I gave everybody copies at Christmas? Oh, yeah, right.
 I don't remember that.
 Well, apparently it's a number-one hit in Israel.
 Hey, Israel.
 Wow.
 Yes.
 And I noticed we had a couple of minutes left, so I thought maybe I could do it on the show.
 Okay, you can do the short version.
 You should know that Muffin Top is also number four in Belgium.
 I said you could do it.
 Why not?! Oh.
 I mean, thank you.
 Hello.
 For over a hundred years, GE has been imagining the future today.
 And I'm here to talk to you today about a wonderful new synergy.
 It's called "product integration.
" It's revolutionizing the way we monetize broadcast television.
 How does it work? Simple.
 All you have to do as the writing staff of an NBC show is incorporate positive mentions-- or PosMens--of GE products into your program.
 For example, you could write an episode where one of your characters purchases-- and is satisfied with one of GE's direct-current drilling motors for an offshore or land-based project.
 Product integration setting a new standard in upward revenue stream dynamics.
 For all of us.
 Now, I'd be happy to answer any questions.
 I'm sorry.
 You're saying you want us to use the show to sell stuff? Look, I know how this sounds.
 No, come on, Jack.
 We're not doing that.
 We're not compromising the integrity of the show to sell-- Wow.
 This is diet Snapple? I know, it tastes just like regular Snapple, doesn't it? You should try Plum-A-Granate.
 It's amazing.
 I only date guys who drink Snapple.
 Look, we all love Snapple.
 Lord knows I do, but focus here.
 We're talking about product integration.
 No, no.
 We are not your shills.
 Oh! Oh-ho.
 I'm sorry.
 That's right.
 They're artists, like James Joyce or Strindberg.
 Get real, kids.
 You write skits mocking our presidents to fill time between car commercials.
 That's not fair.
 Josh gets a lot of fan mail for Gaybraham Lincoln.
 Did you guys know that Holland is the only country with a national dog? I didn't know that.
 Hmm.
 There's little facts under there.
 /That's a lunch break, everybody.
 Back in an hour, please.
 Um, did you talk to Tracy about reading the cue cards? I tried.
 Well, he's not reading them.
 He never reads them, Liz.
 I'm starting to think he can't read! Oh, that-- that's just offensive, Jenna.
 I don't know.
 Have you ever seen him read anything? Of course.
 Like when we shoot promos.
 Hi.
 I'm Tracy Jordan.
 I'm black, NBC! Very proud, like peacocks, right, Janet? Hmm.
 Hey, Tracy, I missed that last run-through.
 Could you run it once off cards for me? Naw, Lemon.
 I'll do that later.
 I gotta bounce.
 Okay, that's the-- It says, "Emergency exit only".
 He couldn't read that? Man, Jenna's really gotten squirrelly since Tracy came along.
 It's so sad.
 What's really sad is that while she's in this fragile state, none of her friends are messing with her head.
 I think we should do something about that.
 Hmm.
 Shh.
 Okay.
 All right.
 Hey,  what are you guys talking about? Oh.
 Uhnothing.
 What, is it about me? Okay.
 Um There's a rumor going around that Donaghy has to cut costs around here.
 Oh.
 Yeah.
 My friend in accounting, Lando Calrissian, he says Jack's probably gonna have to fire an actor.
 Oh.
 Thank you guys for telling me.
 It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
 Yeah, if the fish have daddy issues.
 I can't believe you guys actually wrote a product integration sketch.
 Jack said we had to.
 It just seems weird.
 This show's not a commercial.
 Excuse me.
 Can you tell me where Human Resources is, please? That way.
 Thanks.
 This is gonna sound crazy, but, um Tracy can read, right? What? Are you serious? The guy's done dozens of movies.
 Yeah, but it's not like his movies seem like he's reading a script.
 Let's go rescue Karen or whatever.
 Is there a Cheryl? Then she could tell us where drugs are-- I mean gold-- Then we got the car chase.
 I'm getting way too old for this! Was I supposed to say that then? That's true.
 And he never reads the cue cards God, I thought all that stuff was just crazy Tracy seeing what he could get away with.
 I know, but, you know, it's not surprising.
 Look at the educational system in this country.
 We spend all this money in Iraq, but meanwhile, our inner-city graduation rates are lower than they are in the Sudan.
 That  doesn't sound right.
 Maybe it was Sweden.
 Maybe it was teen pregnancy.
 I gotta read more.
 What can I do for you? So we wrote a product integration sketch.
 Good.
 But we wanted to run it by you first because it's about how GE is making us do this.
 And we were kinda hoping that the GE executive in the sketch could be played byyou.
 Oh, I get it-- The whole self-referential thing: Letterman hates the suits, Stern yells at his boss, Nixon's "sock it to me" on Laugh-In.
 Yeah.
 Hippy humor.
 That's what I'm going for.
 Well, as you know, I've been studying comedy and learning what's funny.
 I'm watching Friends right now.
 What happens with Ross and Rachel? No, no.
 Don't tell me.
 Seriously.
 What were you saying? So will you do it? I don't know, Lemon.
 I'm not an actor.
 This is your world.
 Oh, come on.
 You can do this.
 You were great in that video.
 Yeah! This is live television.
 I've never done anything like that before.
 Okay, I'll do it.
 Ohh! Great, great.
 Thanks, Jack.
 So rehearsal will be tomorrow at 2:00.
 Please don't be late.
 And I will fax you any changes by 9:00 a.
m.
 You're such a Monica! Ah ha! You are.
 Uhh.
 He never reads anything.
 Uh, why is Jack Donaghy on the cast list? Oh, he's gonna do this GE sketch.
 It's really funny.
 Oh, so he gets to be in sketches, but he's gonna fire one of the real actors? What? I got inside information that Jack is gonna fire one of the actors to cut costs.
 No.
 I haven't heard anything like that.
 Don't worry about it.
 Oh, I'm not worried Because I have something the other actors don't.
 A secret weapon.
 Oh, don't say your sexuality.
 My sexuality! Oh, God, Jenna, when has that ever worked? Uh, when has it not worked? It'll be a 45-minute wait.
 Oh, will it? Uh, yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, it will.
 Yeah, but this is different because I know Jack Donaghy.
 I know what he likes.
 Yeah, so now you just have to make yourself ten years younger and Asian.
 I don't know what to tell you.
 They're making me rehearse.
 I know Pat Benatar rarely performs live.
 Scalp the damn tickets.
 These are the changes for the sketches that you're in.
 Cool.
 I'll read those later, Lemon.
 Tray Can you read? Can I read? Please don't get angry.
 It's not your fault.
 It's the system.
 Did you ever see Hoop Dreams? It's like that.
 So you're asking me if I'm illiterate? You  don't even have to answer me if you don't want to.
 Just know that if you need a tutor, we will get you a tutor.
 If you need to be in fewer sketches until you get more confident, we'll accommodate you, whatever you need.
 So I could, like, leave work early if I need a tutor? Absolutely.
 We'll work around your schedule.
 I can't read, Liz Lemon! My shameful secret is out.
 Now you know why I'm always running into the ladies' bathroom.
 I can't read! I sign my name with an X! I once tried to make mashed potatoes with laundry detergent! I think I voted for Nader! Nader! I feel as though a great weight has been lifted off of me, Liz Lemon.
 Today is the first day of the rest of my life.
 All thanks to one very, very special white lady.
 I'll be in late tomorrow.
 Damn, George Will just gets more and more conservative.
 Liz? Hi.
 Did you tell Jack he can be on the show? Yeah, he was kind of excited about it, actually.
 Oh, yeah, he's very excited.
 But you cannot put him on live TV.
 Why? Okay.
 I'm only showing you this because I care about him so much.
 GE Promo.
 Take one.
 Action! Did you say, "Action"? Yes.
 Action! Could you say it louder, please? I'm sorry.
 Action! GE Promo.
 Take two.
 Hello.
 For over a hundred years-- Line? Sorry.
 My bad.
 What's the first line? Product integration! Okay.
 Right, got it.
 I just need the first word.
 Product! What's the second word? Integration.
 Okay, I knew that.
 Okay, d-d-uh If I ask for the line again, don't tell me.
 Line? Line? Product integration.
 I  told you don't give me the line when I ask for the line.
 I got it.
 I got it.
 Could we get a do-over there? Let's go again, can we? What? What is it? I don't like this at all.
 Okay, I got it.
 Let's go again.
 The pen doesn't really write.
 Does that matter? And I'm here today-- My bad.
 I'm sorry.
 OhGod.
 Why don't we go to lunch and we'll come back and maybe-- Let's all go have lunch.
 GE Promo.
 It's weird.
 What do I do with my arms? I've never thought about that before.
 Is it this? Or, if I may, this? Maybe I should just hold something.
 OK, yeah, this feels more natural.
 Is that right? Yeah.
 "New synergy"-- does that sound odd to anyone else? Does that sound like "news energy"? And this satisfies-- Oh.
 Ouch, ouch.
 You all right? Could I get a little, uh I'm here to talk to you television about the monetizing of today broadcast.
 Was any of that usable? GE Promo.
 129.
 It's called, "racial integration"-- No, that's not right, is it? It's called, "product intergort"-- "intergortian"? the way we monetize broadcast television.
 How does it work? Oh! Could we turn off the phones, please? Oh, I'm sorr--ha! I'm sorry.
 That's me.
 Let me turn this thing off here.
 I think I just took a picture.
 I'm sorry, everybody, there's a [bleep] pigeon.
 Shoo! purchases, and is satisfied with--Oh.
 in upward revenue stream dynamics.
 For all of us.
 Cut.
 That's a wrap.
 Ha! That was fun, you guys.
 Didn't feel like five days, did it? No.
 Nah, that wasn't bad.
 Everybody have a good weekend.
 And we'll be right back.
 /Jenna to the stage, please.
 Jenna to the stage for Muffin Top.
 Hey, Liz? Liz I'm a little bit nervous about this rehearsal.
 Oh, I'm glad you brought that up.
 You know, you don't have to do this.
 I know how busy you are.
 Oh, no, I have to do it.
 It's a new challenge, and I like challenges.
 I've summited Kilimanjaro.
 I've showered with Greta Van Susteren.
 I--I'm gonna do this, yeah.
 The time, sir.
 Oh, that's right.
 Do you mind? We'll do it around the corner, okay? I'll be with you in a minute.
 I have a conference with my corporate division head.
 Oh, yeah? Are you guys gonna correlate overseas earnings report dynamics? Yes.
 Liz? Did I just hear Jack? Oh, no, no, no.
 Please.
 I know for a fact he is talking to his boss right now.
 Really? Don't bother him.
 Fine.
 Don't.
 Of course, sir.
 I'll look into it right away.
 Actions speak louder than words.
 Take care of it.
 Don't worry, I'll have it on your desk first thing in the morning.
 Look, I am tired of your promises! I want this thing fixed.
 I'm-- I'm on it, sir.
 So You're Jack's boss, huh? Oh, well, yeah, that's what they tell me.
 I'm Jenna, by the way.
 Oh, I, uh, I know who you are.
 I'm Ron.
 Oh, Ron.
 How do you take your coffee, Ron? I take it? Uh I--I take it, uh, with the non-dairy creamer.
 Mmm.
 Yeah.
 Non-dairy creamer.
 Yum.
 Ahem.
 Ahem.
 Mmm.
 Ahh.
 Oh, yeah.
 Eh-heh.
 Wow.
 Quiet, please! Rehearsing! From Mr.
 Donaghy's entrance.
 What's up, Mr.
 Donaghy? That's Josh's line.
 Your lines are in blue.
 My bad.
 I'm sorry.
 Those cards are a little confusing.
 Hello, everyone.
 Thanks for waiting, please.
 Sitdown.
 Okay, that's great.
 Just one thing, sir.
 You're looking into the camera a little bit.
 No, I'm not.
 I want to, but I'm not.
 No.
 Could I get two coffee cups? Yeah, you know, let's take five minutes, actually, uh, everybody, while we get Mr.
 Donaghy some coffee cups.
 I know you want to do this, but I don't think it's working out.
 I agree.
 It's the writing.
 It's not natural.
 Uhh! Really? You think the problem is the writing? Yeah.
 It's clunky.
 Wow.
 Well, I was really trying to help you out of this, but, you know what? You're the boss.
 I think I can do it.
 No.
  You should definitely do it.
 It'll be hilarious.
 Oh, well, that'd be a refreshing change of pace for the show, wouldn't it? Excuse me.
 Why would Tracy pretend to be illiterate? To get out of coming to work.
 Oh, so first you thought he was illiterate, and now you think he's lazy? Jeez, you are racist.
 No.
 Tracy took advantage of my white guilt, which is to be used only for good, like over-tipping and supporting Barack Obama.
 Summon.
 Hey, Tray.
 Kenneth told me you finally got in to work.
 Yeah, I had to go to reading class.
 You hear this mess about sometimes Y being a vowel? What a world.
 Ah Well, we just wanted to show you the new posters for the show.
 Yeah, all right.
 Cool.
 So it's okay to hang these all over the city? Yeah.
 It's good.
 I like it.
 Really? Really.
 I'll be leaving early today.
 /Jenna and Ghostface Killah, /to the stage, please, for Muffin Top.
 Hello? Jack? It's 3:00 in the morning.
 What's wrong? That's quite a commitment to such terrible writing.
 Lemon, I don't know how to do this.
 I know.
 I don't get it.
 It's not the fear.
 I thrive on fear.
 You're looking out a fake window right now, by the way.
 I bow-hunt polar bear.
 I once drove a rental car into the Hudson just to practice escaping.
 And it's not the public speaking.
 There's just something about performing that I can't wrap my brain around.
 All this creative crap.
 Acting! oh I've never been able to do it.
 Never.
 Grains and cereals are an important-- Oh! Line! Damn it! Son of a bitch! Lemon.
 I need your help.
 Really Jack Donaghy needs my-- Don't gloat.
 It makes you seem mannish.
 Okay.
 Look, this is not your fault.
 This whole thing was a bad idea.
 We should just have Josh do it, and we'll just tell everyone you're on a business trip.
 That's not an option.
 I have to do it.
 Once I set my mind to something, I have to accomplish it.
 Ten years ago, I was an inch-and-a-half shorter than I am today.
 Sheer willpower.
 If I don't figure this thing out by Friday, then failure wins, and that's not acceptable.
 Oh, God, the room is spinning.
 What do you want from me? I'm one of your actors.
 I'm freaking out.
 Talk me down.
 Okay, here's your pep talk.
 You're not an actor.
 You're Jack Donaghy, all right? So quit whining and nut up.
 You're right, if you can't do this, you are a failure.
 Josh can do this, and earlier today, he ate a club sandwich with the toothpicks still in it.
 Jenna can do this, and she was once engaged to David Blaine.
 Any dumb-dumb can act, Jack, so be a man and get it done.
 If you were any other woman on earth I would be turned on right now.
 Go home.
 Get some sleep.
 This stays between us, right, Lemon? Lemon? Lemon? Lemon? Well, I don't think I have to worry about my job anymore.
 And I didn't bother Jack at all.
 Oh, good for you.
 That's right.
 I took your advice.
 I hooked up with his boss.
 Who, Ron? Mm-hmm.
 That guy's an extra on the show.
 No.
 He said he was Jack's boss.
 No.
 In the sketch.
 He doesn't even have a line.
 He doesn't have lines? Don't eat in costume! Give me a break.
 I'm just-- But he was yelling at Jack.
 Actions speak louder than words.
 Take care of it.
 Don't worry, sir, I'll have it on your desk first thing in the morning.
 I am tired of your promises.
 I just want this thing fixed now! I'm on it, sir.
 What is the point of belonging to the Extras Guild if I cannot get health coverage for my foot, hmm? Ew.
 Oh, God, Jenna.
 I told you, don't listen to rumors.
 But Frank and Toofer said to me-- Frank and Toofer? That's where you're getting your information? They're messing with you! No.
 They wouldn't do that to me.
 Yeah, they would.
 Oh! I am gonna get back at them using my sexuality.
 Do you have any left? /Jenna, Ghostface Killah, and Yo-Yo Ma /to the stage, please, for Muffin Top.
 Where the hot lesbians at, Lemon? I knew it! You can read! Fine.
 Yes, I'm literate! I even have a column in Ebony called Musings! You are unbelievable.
 I'm unbelievable? What about your racist mess? Thinking a grown man is illiterate.
 That's the subtle racism of lowered expectations.
 Bing Crosby said that.
 No, Bill Cosby said that.
 That's racist.
 Look, we can all agree Liz is generally pretty racist.
 The point is, you have people counting on you.
 You can't be finding excuses not to be here.
 But this job is hard! I just want to be able to do what I want to do.
 You know, I once shot a whole movie without ever getting out of my car? Yeah, I paid to see that.
 That was supposed to be a western.
 You're not a big shot movie star anymore, Tray.
 You're the star of TGS, and you will read the lines as written, starting tonight because this show is important.
 I set a very high standard for myself, and I expect the same of the professionals who work with me.
 When Gaybraham Lincoln gets hit in the crotch, can I go cross-eyed? Oh, yes, do that.
 That's hilarious! Hey have you seen Frank or Toofer? Pete! The standards lady is saying that my moaning in Muffin Top is too graphic.
 Which of these is less offensive? Ahh! Ahh! Ahhh! Or Ooh-hunh! Unh-hunh! Ohhh! Both sound good to me.
 Hello, Ron.
 I would just hate for Muffin Top to get cut because of a standards problem.
 I've already posted it on my weblog though I'll be doing it.
 Jenna, we're not gonna cut it.
 Are you messing with me? Because people around here keep messing with me.
 I'm not messing with you.
 So which one? Ahh! Or, ohhh! Uh, I guess Uh, "ahh ahh! Ahh.
" Oh, Hey.
 Look, it's no big deal, but we had to make some changes in your sketch, okay? I have new pages for you.
 You do? Yeah.
 Tracy is now in it now, so we had to change some of the cues.
 Also, the opening VT is cut, so you just go right out, okay? Oh, and, um, you all say the last line together.
 Wow.
 So, uh So you're gonna be great.
 Have fun.
 Lemon, these pages are blank.
 Oh.
 Never mind.
 Withdrawn.
 And, remember, don't look into the camera! Toofer? Yeah? Can I tell you a secret? Sure.
 We've been working together a while, and I know this may sound crazy, but I've been watching you.
 I have this fantasy of sneaking up to the roof of 30 Rock, and we make love while looking out at the city- Okay, let me guess.
 You figured out Frank and I lied to you, so to get even, you're trying to get me naked on the roof and leave me there.
 Nice try.
 Where's Frank? But we're cool, right, Mr.
 Donaghy? No, you're all fired.
 No, you're all fired.
 Hey, good job the other night.
 Oh, you mean on the show? Thanks.
 What were you watching? Nothing.
 Uh Bloomberg.
 Hmm.
 Aha! Don't be cute, Lemon.
 You're too old for that.
 Good God! Lemon! Mr.
 Donaghy, open up! Please? Lemon! * Everyone knows * The most delicious part of the muffin * * Is the top * My muffin top * Is all that whole grain, low-fat * * I know you want a piece of that * * But I just wanna dance * * Ch-checkin' out my sweet hips * * My sugar-coated berry lips * * I know you want to get with this * * But I'm just here to dance * * So back * Up off of me * You're we-ee-ee-eirding * Me out * I'm an independent lady * So do not try to play me * * I run a tidy bakery * The boys all want my cake for free * Does she know we went off the air two minutes ago?

 Smart move.
   

                




                    			You're my girl, right? And I take care of you, huh? Who knows? Maybe we'll see Natalie Morales, you know? That little firecracker, she gets my blood running south of the border.
 That is less sweet.
 I'm gonna stop by tonight.
 Maybe I'll pick up some Chinese.
 Aw, you said "Chinese" instead of something offensive.
 Yeah, I told you, losing you last year, changed me, huh? It made me more, ummore mature.
 Huh? Come here.
 Ow, that really hurts, Dennis.
 You're back with Dennis? Yeah, I'm back with Dennis.
 Don't look at me with your eyebrows all up.
 It's so annoying.
 Yes, I'm annoying, not the man who honked your boobs on the jumbo screen.
 That was before.
 And it was the playoffs.
 Does he still work at that beeper store? What is it, "Beeper King"? He is the King now.
 The old Beeper King retired Well, technically he shot himself.
 But Dennis took over and now he's the only beeper salesman left in Manhattan, which is cool in a way.
 You're doing the eyebrow thing again.
 Because it's Dennis.
 Who are you trying to fool? This is me.
 Exactly.
 You don't get to give dating advice.
 You sent a letter to Scott Peterson.
 After he dyed his hair and got super thin from all the stress.
 Are you kidding me? He was smokin'.
 Dennis is a good guy, okay? Not really.
 So when did this happen? Well, last week was my birthday, and everyone forgot except Dennis.
 And he called, and we went out, and it wasn't too weird.
 And how is the sex? Fast and only on Saturdays.
 It's perfect.
 Did you see this? It's horrible.
 They're printing libel about me again.
 Libel, Liz Lemon! Oh"Normal.
" How dare they? That's what I'm saying.
 That's character assassination.
 That's not normal! It only looks like I'm walking out of a Starbucks when, actually, I'm doing the robot goin' backwards into a Starbucks.
 And I don't even know whose dog that is.
 Yes, I steal dogs.
 What is the problem? I can't be normal! If I'm normal, I'm boring.
 If I'm boring, I'm not a movie star.
 If I'm not a movie star, then I'm poor.
 And poor people can't afford to pay back the $75,000 in cash they owe Quincy Jones! WowTalking to that guy, it's like looking in a mirror, huh? Well, my armpit rash is back.
 Oh, Jack.
 You're in wardrobe.
 The latest research is in.
 Our audience doesn't like green.
 Oh, that's too bad.
 I like green.
 Research doesn't lie, Jenna.
 It lets us know what we're thinking-- What's too boring, what's too gay, what's too old.
 What's too old? That's a very good question.
 How old are you? I'm 29.
 What year were you born? 1977.
 When did you graduate high school? '94.
 When do you turn 40? 2017.
 Junior high crush? Kirk Cameron.
 Prom theme? Motownphilly, Boyz II Men.
 What movie did you lose your virginity at? Arachnophobia.
 Theater or drive-in? What's a drive-in? Of course.
 I don't know why I bothered to ask.
 I can tell just from your physical appearance that you're obviously So these page numbers, when done correctly, should be sequential.
 Oh.
 Oh, Josh! Liz Taylor's assistant called.
 They wanted the address here to send you something.
 That's awesome.
 She must have seen my impression of her.
 Sounds like someone loves Liz Taylor.
 I do.
 No, we mean love love.
 Yeah, like if she walked in right now and said she wanted to do it with you, you would.
 I definitely would.
 What? Liz.
 (Josh) No, I'm totally serious.
 I mean, wouldn't you guys? Jack asked me how old I am.
 What did you say? Ahem.
 Jenna, relax.
 I cannot and will not relax, Liz.
 I am an actress.
 And when someone asks an actress how old she is, it's more statement than question.
 When my mom's feeling old, she goes to this guy on 71st Street.
 But she's old.
 She's like 38.
 I'm gonna be sick.
 * Betcha he reads, betcha she sews * * Betcha they've made me *  A closet * Of clothes * Lemon, what tragedy happened in your life that you insist upon punishing yourself with all this mediocrity? What? 'Cause I'm eating a turkey sub? Your turkey sub, your clothes, the fact that a woman of your resources and position lives like some boxcar hobo.
 Or maybe it's the fact that while I'm saying all this, you have a piece of lettuce stuck in your hair.
 This is the unlisted number.
.
 of Stone, the most exclusive restaurant in the city, currently.
 I think it's time that you start enjoying some of the finer things in life.
 Completely unsolicited and inappropriate.
 I will only accept it because I love food.
 Do you know why Jack Welch is the greatest leader since the pharaohs? Because he didn't only involve himself in our work lives, but our personal lives as well.
 He introduced us to the finest booze, the most restrictive country clubs.
 He gave us the names of the most discreet private investigators to spy on our ex-wives.
 He held our hands during our triumphs and our Senate hearings.
 I want to hold your hand, Lemon.
 Yikes.
 This is a perfect example.
 You have a million-dollar view, yet you refuse to acknowledge that there's a whole world out there.
 Oh, my.
 There appears to be a gentleman making passionate, angry, love to himself.
 Yeah, I know.
 That's why I closed the blinds in the first place.
 Right in his office.
 Huh.
 Lemon, I like to think of myself as a winner.
 I like to surround myself with winners.
 I see potential in you.
 Let me be your Jack Welch.
 Let me be your mentor.
 No, thank you.
 That is unfortunate.
 You've,  uh got to admire his persistence and stamina, though.
 Am I wrong, or is he in the middle of a staff meeting? Maybe you should be his mentor.
 Obviously, he doesn't need one.
 He's got it all figured out.
 I got one for ya.
 See the old guy over there with the girl? Mistress or daughter? Oh, my God, I hope it's his daughter.
 Yeah, me too.
 Oh, my God! Oh! God, I hope it's his mistress.
 Oh, that is just wrong.
 Hey, 007, how about some more rolls over here, huh? Oh, my, my, what a pleasant surprise-- Lemon.
 And you brought a man.
 Jack Donaghy.
 And this is my friend Anastasia.
 How are you? Hi.
 Dennis Duffy, Beeper King.
 The Beeper King, really? Uh, Dennis has his own business.
 Yes, he's an entrepreneur.
 He's very successful.
 You've probably seen my ads on the 7 train, right? I didn't know they served chicken nuggets at this restaurant.
 It's cod.
 It's, uh-- They made it special.
 Dennis has some dietary restrictions.
 Actually, I'm allergic to all fish unless it's fried.
 You know? That's a sharp tie you've got there, Dennis.
 That douche bag up front made me wear it.
 Does he know you're the Beeper King? I don't think so.
 Anyway, thanks for the hook-up.
 This is clearly the nicest restaurant we've ever been to.
 Hold on a second.
 This place ain't that nice, all right? It's got rats and roaches like every other restaurant.
 No rat talk tonight, okay? You know there are 17 rats per person in Manhattan? You eat a pound of rat crap every year without even knowing it, huh? I think I read about that in The New Yorker.
 Anyway, we'll leave you to your meal.
 I hope you enjoy the, uh, choices that you've made.
 Stop it.
 And that former call girl went on to become one of NBC's biggest news anchors.
 Star coming! Wall hug, everybody.
 [gasp] That's Tracy Jordan.
 He seems like such a nice, normal young man.
 [screaming] No! Let's keep going, you guys.
 Let's keep goin'.
 I enjoyed the restaurant.
 Thank you.
 Just say it.
 Just say what you're dying to say.
 Dennis is nice to me, okay? He fixed my toilet.
 He broke it first, but he fixed it.
 And he loves hockey, and I'mfiguring it out.
 And it's easy-- I get a lot of work done.
 I don't have time for a personal life, okay? I can't just go to Central Park and join the singles touch football league.
 Like I'd want to anyway.
 People in those posters, always laughing in their sweaters.
 Who are they foolin'? Oh, okay, you're not going to say anything to me because I rejected you as a mentor? Who cares? I have a lot of friends I can talk to about my life.
 The bottom line is, Dennis is my boyfriend because he inquired.
 He was the only applicant, and I am not-- Doin' great.
 Come in.
 Do you have a minute? I gotta talk to you about this whole Dennis thing-- Ah!  What did you do to yourself? Me? Nothing.
 Just getting more rest, drinking more water.
 Really? This water-- does someone boil it first, then throw it in your face? Okay, I had a little Botox and some collagen, and a chemical peel, and something with shark DNA.
 Admit it, I look ten years younger.
 No, younger even.
 You look like a fetus.
 Look, I came here to talk to you about my problems with Dennis.
 Oh, I can't right now, honey.
 If I don't do my facial exercises, I could wind up looking weird.
 I just mentioned Dennis, and your eyebrows didn't go up.
 They didn't? No.
 How about now? Unh-uh.
 Anything? Hey, what's up, baby? Liz around? She should be back soon.
 Is that a present for her? Yeah.
 If she doesn't get back here soon, I'm pokin' air holes in it.
 Excuse me.
 I couldn't help but notice that, uh none of you are wearing beepers.
 You sell beepers? I sell a way of life, my friend.
 Cool.
 I can use some ironic accessories.
 What are you doing here? Hey, I bought you a present.
 Oh? Uh-oh.
 Oh, no.
 It got out.
 If anyone sees a salamander, it's Liz's.
 No.
 I don't want a salamander! And I don't want you here selling beepers.
 Why not? I mean, you work in a business.
 Business people need beepers.
 No, they need cell phones.
 Oh, yeah, for now.
 But the beeper's gonna be making a comeback.
 Technology's cyclical.
 No technology is not cyclical.
 (Jack) I thought I recognized that voice.
 Dennis, how the heck are you? Did you enjoy that restaurant? Nah, I think I was right about that place.
 We actually saw a whole nest of rats when we were leaving.
 No, we didn't.
 I just didn't want to tell you 'cause I knew you'd freak out.
 Actually, I think I saw a rat king.
 Aren't rat kings a myth? What's a rat king? Oh, it's when a bunch of rats are crammed into a tiny space, and their tails get all tangled up, and they can't even pull apart.
 And  then it gets awesome.
 Eventually, their bodies fuse together and they form a multi-headed live rat king.
 And we saw one.
 Gosh, I hope you got a picture of that with the camera on your beeper.
 Actually, my beeper doesn't have a camera, but it does have a pedometer.
 Actually, not this one.
 [whispering] I love him.
 Listen, I need to talk to you in my office, please.
 Why? Now.
 What's up? Is that a tattoo? Uh-huh.
 [chuckles] Who normal now? You hear me, America? Who's normal now? How could you do this to the show? I got this tattoo for the good of the show.
 It gives us an edge-- the reason why you brought me on.
 And when you purchase Tracy Jordan, he comes with a tattoo of a biblical dragon from outer space.
 It's gonna take forever to cover this thing with makeup.
 You can't put makeup on my tattoo, Liz Lemon.
 It's in my contract.
 No, it's not.
 Actually, he's got a pretty weird contract.
 Great.
 Jenna looks like a porn star burn victim, and now this idiot.
 What am I gonna do? It's gonna be Josh's busiest show ever.
 Oof Josh? Miss Taylor.
 When your office said you were sending me something, I didn't realize it would be you.
 But I had to give you this gift in person, Josh.
 Oh.
 I'm just glad you weren't offended by my impression.
 Oh but I was deeply.
 I'm here to give you the gift of pain.
 The gift of what? White diamonds! Ha ha! Okay, very funny.
 You bought a pager from Dennis.
 Will you take it off now, please? Oh, I can't.
 I'm expecting a call from 1983.
 Look, Dennis takes care of me, okay? Liz, I'd like you to meet Howard Jorgensen.
 Liz, how do you do? He's the vice president of locomotives, and a rising star at GE.
 I thought the two of you had a lot in common.
 You are relentless.
 Look, uh, Howard, you're obviously an attractive and confident guy, and at a different time in my life, I could definitely see the two of us together.
 I'm married with two beautiful kids and a pool.
 (Jack) Liz, I wasn't trying to set you up.
 I wanted to show you my handiwork.
 I used to mentor Howard.
 (Howard) I was a lot like you.
 I dressed poorly, had bad posture, walked around with lettuce in my hair.
 Oh, son of a bitch.
 And I cursed like a sailor.
 But Jack saw potential in me.
 He changed my life.
 Now Howard's earning seven figures and he's married to a swell Filipino gal.
 [chuckles] Oh, thanks, Jack.
 Look, I told you, I don't need a mentor.
 Fine.
 Liz Taylor really messed him up.
 He might have brain damage.
 (Liz on phone) Oh, my God.
 Maybe the musical guest can do some extra songs this week.
 Who is it? James Blunt.
 Oh.
 No, I said no lettuce.
 Are you at that crappy sandwich place again? Yeah-- why is everybody judging all of my choices lately? This place is fine-- It's convenient, it's consistent, I know what I'm getting, it doesn't make me feel bad about my body.
 And you know what? Maybe I'm at an age where it's okay for me to settle for this.
 Are we still talking about the sandwich place? No, sadly, I don't think we are.
 Okay.
 I admit it.
 Dennis isn't a sandwich I want to eat every day for the rest of my life.
 I'm clueless about men.
 I'm clueless about everything that isn't this show.
 Maybe you can tell me how to live, because sadly, you may be the most stable person I know right now.
 Gentlemen, we'll have to continue this conference some other time.
 (Howard on speakerphone) That's her again, isn't it? Hi, Howard.
 (hangs up phone) Lemon, today is the first day of the rest of your life, and what is the first thing you need to do? I have to break up with Dennis.
 And why is that? Because he wears shirts with the Looney Tunes embroidered on them.
 Because he cuts his own hair.
 Because that one little nice thing that he does, doesn't make up for the fact that I don't want to be seen with him in public.
 And if you don't break up with him now? He'll just keep showing up at work to sell beepers.
 He'll just keep calling my mother to borrow money.
 We'll just get more and more tangled up in each other's lives until I just can't even get away and we're just like-- Oh, my God.
 That's right.
 He's the rat king.
 And there's only one way to break up with a rat.
 You have to cut him off completely.
 I know.
 You have to stuff your heart with steel wool and tinfoil.
 You must be ruthless.
 You must to be absolute.
 Remember always, you are The Exterminator.
 Say it.
 I am The Exterminator.
 Say it like you mean it.
 I am The Exterminator! Louder! [shouting] I am The Exterminator! Okay, not that loud.
 [whispering] People are trying to work around here, okay? (woman on P.
A.
) 30 minutes to dress rehearsal.
 Tracy, they need you in wardrobe.
 (woman) That's 30 minutes till dress rehearsal.
 Why is part of your face still on the pillow? Damn it.
 Where's my Sharpie? Oh, it is fake! Look, I'm crazy, not stupid.
 A movie star can't have a big old permanent face tattoo.
 I just need to walk around with this for a week, get  my picture on the interweb, show the world I'm still dangerous.
 And then what about next week when you don't have it anymore? You're gonna look like-- I had extreme plastic surgery to have it removed.
 Ba-boom! That's another "Not Normal.
" You know this is very, very, very bad for me, right? I need to protect my reputation.
 You take away my street cred, and I am Wayne Brady.
 Nuh-uh.
 Wayne Brady has three Emmys.
 You have a People's Choice Award that you stole from Wayne Brady.
 I shouldn't expect a white woman from Whiteville to understand street cred.
 First of all, I'm not from Whiteville.
 I'm from White Haven, and it's not as nice as it sounds.
 Ohfine! You can keep the tattoo.
 For this week only.
 (man) Okay, here we go.
 Quiet, please! Rehearsing! (male announcer) And now, a word from the White House.
 Good evening.
 I'm Laura Bush.
 And I'm Condoleezza Rice.
 [indistinctly] And I'm John Kerry.
 Well, we had a good run.
 What the hell happened here? The cast had a rough week.
 These people cannot be on television.
 What is your contingency plan for a crapstorm of this magnitude? There is none.
 We go live in a half an hour.
 No wonder your career is being held back by a lack of foresight and an addiction to dysfunctional relationships.
 You have no exit strategies.
 He knows about my marriage? No.
 This is gonna be a bad show.
 Worse than the time we let Tracy do that tribute to August Wilson? That was my fault.
 I should have made sure he knew who August Wilson was.
 Maybe we'll be pre-empted by some national news event.
 How's Gerald Ford's health? Oh, a blackout.
 That'll work.
 (Pete) All right, Nobody panic! The backup generator will kick in in just a few seconds.
 Okay, you can panic.
 (Liz) This is real.
 We dodged a bullet here tonight, Lemon.
 Yes, this blackout is a fortunate coincidence.
 You didn't do it, right? What, do you think I control the universe? Yo, this blackout messed me up.
 I didn't get to debut my dragon face.
 Could I do the Today Show tomorrow? No, you're on a plane to Boston tomorrow, Tray.
 We have a laboratory.
 They're experimenting in tattoo removal.
 It promises to be one of our biggest profit centers once today's generation finally sobers up.
 Tattoo's fake, Donaghy.
 Fake.
 Street cred.
 He's a genius.
 (man) Flashlight, $20! Flashlight, $20! Can I give you a ride? Flashlight, $20! No.
 I wouldn't want to crowd you.
 Be strong, Lemon.
 Don't let Dennis chew his way out of this one.
 (man) Flashlight, $20! Can I borrow 20 bucks? (man) Flashlight, $20! Dennis, wake up.
 Huh? What? You could've burned the place down.
 I wish I had burned the place down.
 There's no reason to live anymore.
 What happened? The Islanders lost tonight.
 Doesn't that happen a lot? I knew you wouldn't understand.
 So how did it go? He moved in with me.
 Well, of course he did.
   

                




                    			Why is there hair everywhere? Did you shave in the kitchen? The water in here is softer.
 Look at this ski-jumping idiot, Bode Miller.
 What kind of a fruity name is Bode? That cereal has the Olympics on it? It must be eight months old.
 When you and me have kids, we're gonna give them good names, like Shannon or Rick.
 When we what? When we have kids, dummy.
 Come on.
 Yeah, I gotta go.
 Uh Are you gonna be home later? I gotta talk to you about something.
 I'll be right here.
 Look at this maze.
 It's so easy.
 You have to go in here, and out there.
 Be home early, okay? Come here, sweetheart.
 Oh, Dennis.
 I just did my hair.
 Oh, that's my girl.
 There you go.
 Bye.
 Now make sure you drink plenty of fluids, and get something to eat.
 Don't do anything strenuous tonight.
 Don't hit the clubs.
 No, I'm going straight home, actually.
 I'm breaking up with my boyfriend tonight.
 I can't take it anymore.
 Hmm, 35, single, no children.
 Three sexual partners in the last ten years.
 I don't know, doll.
 Maybe it's time to settle.
 Chocolate chip, or butter crunch? (Jenna) I can't believe that this is happening to me.
 It's just not fair.
 (Pete) You're right.
 This business is unfair.
 What happened? Jenna was supposed to be on the Conan show tonight, but I got bumped.
 Oh, you know, that kind of thing happens.
 Jack bumped her and put Tracy on instead.
 Jenna, you can't let this kind of thing get to you.
 I just feel like everything always gets taken away from me.
 No, that's not true.
 What about that movie you did last summer? "The Rural Juror"? Yeah, The Rur-- That one.
 Rural Juror, apple three, take one.
 Mark! A terrible title.
 Action! When does that come out? "The Rural Juror" opens in selected theaters December 18th.
 Does Jack Donaghy even know I'm in The Rural Juror? Maybe if he knew I have a film career, he would treat me with more respect.
 /Jenna to the set, please.
 /Jenna to the set for /Rodney Stink Confirmed Bachelor.
 I will tell him.
 I will tell him that you are in a feature film called The Rrr Jrr.
 What the hell's her movie called? I don't know.
 She's been talking about it for a year.
 I can't ask her now.
 I can't believe Jack did this to her.
 I can't believe Conan's gonna have Tracy on as a guest again, considering what happened the last time.
 You seem like you have a nice chemistry I am a stabbing robot.
 I will stab you.
 Oh, jeez.
 All right, no, okay.
 All right, all right.
 That's great, Tracy.
 We'll take a break.
 We'll be right back.
 Hey, Clariss, can I see Josh's Stone Phillips wig? Oh, great.
 Do you mind if I pop it on you, actually? I want to see the shape of it.
 Please, it would make my wife's dream come true.
 Oh.
 Yeah? Handsome? Yes.
 You find me handsome? Yes, very much.
 You know, I used to be very rich.
 Hello.
 Oh, hi.
 Sorry.
 I know you're wearing that as a joke, but it makes you look younger, and more confident, and I think you should consider it.
 Can I see you in my office? Yeah, hang on a second, actually.
 Why did you bump Jenna from Conan? Because if I have a choice between an international movie star, and a woman who does commercials for ShopRite-- No, no, no.
 Jenna doesn't do those commercials anymore.
 She got fired.
 I don't do these things just to drive you crazy, Lemon.
 I do them for the good of the show.
 I'm the one that always has to clean up the mess afterwards.
 That's why my job is way better than yours.
 /Way better.
 Conan.
 Tracy's really excited to be back on your show.
 I don't know, Jack.
 He's kind of a loose cannon, and I like to surround myself with people that don't try to stab me.
 Tracy's feeling a lot better now.
 He's under a doctor's care.
 That's what they said about Hasselhoff, then he tried to make out with me during a commercial break.
 Conan, this is important to me.
 So we can either do this the easy way, or the hard way.
 What's the hard way? You do a live Christmas Eve special from Kabul every year until the war on terror is won.
 Tell Tracy I'll see him tonight.
 You, black Irish bastard.
 Back at you, man.
 I have to be charming on Conan tonight.
 This is my chance to redeem myself with mainstream America.
 Okay, well just tell us some things about your life, and we'll try to punch it up and make it talk show-worthy.
 Maybe something about you and your wife.
 Me  and my wife like to play "rape.
" She go in the bathroom and do her hair.
 Then I put on a ski mask Okay, not that.
 Hey, uh, you got anything about being a dad? People eat that garbage up.
 I like to walk around my house naked, to remind my oldest son who's still got the biggest ding dong.
 No.
 I can tell the story of how I met Sharon Stone.
 Oh, what was that? I was pooping in the ladies' room at the Ivy No.
 My hair hurts.
 Anybody gonna answer the phone? What phone? Is anybody gonna answer the phone? The phone! It's ringing! Ring! Ring! So you wanted to see me? Oh, Lemon, wonderful.
 I'm introducing Jack Welch with a dinner at the Waldorf.
 What's a funny little quip I could open with? That's why you called me up here? Okay.
 Uh "Good evening.
 It's great to be here at the beautiful Waldorf Astoria.
 "I haven't seen this many white people in tuxedoes since the Titanic.
" Lemon, this is not open mike night at the Bryn Mawr student union.
 This is a $1,000 a plate fund raiser.
 Okay, uh How about, "Wow, $1,000 a plate.
 "For that kind of money this stuffed chicken breast better paint my house.
" Let me tell you what I was thinking of saying.
 "Jack Welch has such unparalleled management skills, they named Welch's grape juice after him.
 "Because he squeezes the sweetest juice out of his workers' mind grapes.
" That doesn't even make sense.
 No, it doesn't, does it? I wrote it down in the middle of the night.
 Listen, I'll try to come up with something for you, but I gotta get back downstairs.
 Lizzie  needs help.
 Cookie in the middle of the day? I gave blood.
 Does that burn calories? What else? What else is on my mind grapes? I could talk about how the moon is a spy satellite put there by Oprah and minister Farrakhan.
 And not the minister Farrakhan you're thinking of.
 Who's that dude? Uh, what dude? The blue dude.
 Tell him to stop staring at me.
 I don't like that dude.
 I don't like that dude.
 Meep.
 Hey, guys.
 That was weird.
 Hi.
 You missed it.
 Tracy was acting old-school bananas.
 He's always bananas.
 No, this was different.
 Yeah.
 Like Conan-should-be-afraid different.
 Really? Where did he go? Yes.
 I am having problems with my cable television.
 Yes, I will hold.
 Excuse me, I have another call.
 Hi, mom.
 I am doing fine.
 Oh, that's not good.
 Frank, that was my blood cookie.
 Ew, what? Hey, Jack Attack.
 Sorry, I should have kept that one in the old brain box.
 Could you sign that for me, please? Pete, where is your charisma? What? The wig.
 I prefer that you wear it.
 Well, I thought you were joking.
 Well, let me clarify: I'm not joking.
 Pete, did you know that men with full heads of hair on average earn 17% more than their bald counterparts? I did not know that.
 Perhaps it's because bald men are generally less informed than men with full heads of hair.
 But here's what I want you to do.
 Wear the wig for a week.
 And experience your full potential.
 I think this is my full potential.
 I know you're skeptical, Pete, I know.
 Here, I want you to do something.
 Pull my hair.
 Right now, go ahead.
 Pull my hair.
 I'm just kidding.
 It's real.
 I'm not like you.
 So, be honest with me.
 What did Jack say? I guess he thinks that Tracy is a movie star.
 And he doesn't love it that you did those commercials.
 Well, you tell him that those commercials paid for my vacation home.
 So, unless he would like to buy me a condo in Clearwater, Florida Jenna, I'm sorry.
 Just let it go.
 Tracy's doing Conan tonight.
 Liz Lemon, we got a problem.
 Grizz and Dotcom say Tracy's doctor put him on some new medication.
 I guess he's having some sort of reaction.
 Boy, Conan tapes in Less than two hours.
 Call me if you need me.
 Tray? Can I come in? I'm bugging out! I'm bugging out.
 I'm bugging out! Tracy! Who is your doctor? Dr.
 Spaceman! Dr.
 Spaceman! Oh, brother.
 Look around.
 We have to find his medication.
 Dr.
 Spaceman.
 Dr.
 Spaceman.
 Wow, Dr.
 Spaceman.
 I owe you an apology, Tray.
 This is Dr.
 Leo Spa-che-men.
 Hi,  I work with Tracy Jordan, and I think he's having a reaction to some of the medication you put him on.
 Ah, I was afraid this might happen.
 You know, he's on so many different neuroleptics, and tricyclics, that there's no telling how they'll mix.
 But what can you do? Medicine's not a science.
 What exactly are you treating him for? /There's not really a name for what Tracy has.
 Basically it's erratic tendencies, and delusions, brought on by excessive notoriety.
 And certainly not helped by my wildly experimental treatments.
 Boy, I'm being awfully open with you, miss.
 I should not have taken those blue things.
 So, is he dangerous? /No, he should be fine, so long as you keep him away from bright lights, loud music and crowds.
 I'll call in a prescription for something to settle him down, as soon as possible.
 Uhdo you need anything for yourself? What? No.
 Just, where can I pick up Tracy's prescription? Ms.
 Lemon, they need you upstairs in Mr.
 Donaghy's office immediately.
 Kenneth, I need you to go to RiteDrug, Yes, sir.
 What is it? What's the emergency? How's this for an opening line? When I first met Jack Welch, I thought he was such a great golfer, he made Bob Darnell look like Randy Barnes.
 That's fine.
 Do that.
 I don't know.
 Might be distasteful if Randy's widow's in the audience.
 What did you come up with? I have a bigger problem, Jack.
 I don't think Tracy's ready to do Conan.
 I think you should let Jenna do it, and maybe Tracy could do it in a couple of weeks.
 Jenna's not a star.
 She's capable, but she's not a star.
 She's got a movie coming out next month.
 What movie? "The Rrr Jrr.
" The what? Tracy's acting nuts.
 He's having problems with his medication.
 Did you call Dr.
 Spa-che-men? Yeah, I did.
 Then he'll be fine.
 Leo's an excellent physician.
 And a pretty good dentist.
 Is that rehearsal? Oh no--Oh! No, this Tracy situation is really Are we still talking about that? Do I have to come in and run your show? Or could you take this one thing off my plate? No,  I got it.
 I'll figure it out.
 What? Don't ask.
 Who is this leader of men? What can I do for you, handsome? Liz I wanted you to be the first to know.
 After the way Jack treated me today, I can't work here anymore.
 I quit.
 Oh, Jenna, I really don't have time for this.
 Then, I guess this is goodbye.
 Okay.
 Jenna don't quit.
 The show can't go on without you.
 You're my muse, you're a modern-day Lucille Ball.
 You're prettier than Deborah Messing.
 Please don't quit.
 Well, if that's the way you feel, I'll stay.
 Okay.
 Oh, it's Dennis.
 Oh.
 Do you have any food? I'm getting really low blood sugar.
 Are you dieting finally? What are you doing? South Beach, Master Cleanse? Hello? Whoa, gimme, gimme.
 Shoo.
 Liz, hey.
 It's me, Dennis.
 Dennis, what do you want? (Dennis on the phone) Do me a huge favor.
 Call Ticketmaster right away.
 Nickleback just added another date, right? I would do it on your computer, but I'm downloading a game right now.
 No, I can't do that for you.
 Just be home tonight when I get there, okay? I need to talk to you about something.
 Word.
 (Tracy) Blue man! That blue dude keeps following me! Meek, eep.
 All right, let's get him down to Conan's hair and make-up and hopefully Kenneth will be back any minute.
 Oh, my.
 (Tracy) No! No! Agh! No! No! The blue man is runnin' up on me.
 There's no blue man.
 I can't take the blue man.
 I don't want the blue man.
 All right, all right.
 Hey, Liz.
 What's up? Oh, hi, Conan.
 How are you? Good.
 You still going out with that guy from the pager store? Who, Dennis? Yeah.
 You still, um How's your wife? Let's not do this, Elizabeth.
 Okay.
 (Tracy) Nyah, nyah, nyah.
 Nah! Vocal warm-ups.
 I'll tell him you came by.
 Okay.
 Whoa, he licked all of those.
 After you, ma'am.
 (Liz) Chewbacca, may I speak to Tracy, please? How's it going? No! Past Pete is here to kill Future Pete! It's going great.
 No! (Liz) It's all right, Tracy.
 Come back.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Do you have a prescription [whispering] for Mr.
 Tracy Jordan? (Liz) Come on out of there, buddy.
 Oh, I almost forgot.
 Jack would like to see you up in his office.
 Oh, I don't have time for this.
 Yes, Jonathan tell him I've got my hands full with Tracy.
 You sound upset.
 (Liz) I am upset.
 Come on up and we'll talk about it.
 Fine.
 I will try the other location.
 But frankly, LaDonica, you have not been real helpful.
 We'll get to your problem in a minute.
 Have you had a chance to think of my zinger? "Well, it's almost Thanksgiving, everybody.
 "And I know what this crowd's giving thanks for.
 Estate tax reform.
" That is terrific.
 I really enjoyed that.
 But, do you think it's too topical? Damn, I wish this event were tonight.
 It's not tonight? When is it? February.
 Why are you wearing a tux? It's after 6:00.
 What am I, a farmer? It's 6:00.
 You are right after this commercial, Mr.
 Jordan.
 You can do this.
 Mr.
 Blue man.
 You're gonna tell me my feet stink? You don't even have feet.
 Blue man! Blue man, where your feet at? (woman) This is home to Late Night with Conan O'Brien.
 That's right.
 Now we are on the I'm sorry.
 Excuse me.
 This is a page coming through.
 I'm sorry.
 Let me just (Pete) Let him through! No.
 Please.
 Here it is! No.
 Pete! I'm trying.
 Give me his pills! Here.
 They're from Dr.
 Spaceman.
 (Conan) my first guest tonight from his numerous hit releases including "President Homeboy" and "Honky Grandma Be Tripping.
" Or you may know him from his last appearance on this show, when he tried to stab me in the face.
 (Stage manager) Gotta go! Excuse me.
 Tracy.
 (Conan) Please welcome Tracy Jordan.
 You know, you really went above and beyond for that guy today.
 I just hope we get away with it.
 This is going on a little long.
 Don't, don't.
 Don't do that.
 Pants on.
 Pants on.
 Sit in the chair, buddy.
 Sit in the chair.
 Sit down.
 Sit.
 Oh! Sit down! That a boy.
 (Conan)  Good to have you here.
 That was great, and you're-- And he's asleep.
 Whichis okay, 'cause at least he didn't murder me.
 (Conan) We'll take a break, and Tracy Jordan, everybody! Hey, you did good, kid.
 Give me that.
 I really gotta eat something.
 I've lost track of it! Hey.
 Hey.
 What's up? I didn't know what you wanted, so I ordered you a cheeseburger.
 Oh, Dennis.
 Thank you.
 Oh, thank you, thank you.
 Thank you so much.
 So what did you want to talk to me about, huh? Nothing.
 I forget.
 I just want to listen to you play Halo 'til I fall asleep.
 Ah, that's baloney! How did the grenade not kill him? He was standing right next to it.
 You know what, Liz? This controller's defective.
 Liz? Well, I got started in the NBC page program.
 And before you know it, I'm making hit movies with my good friend, and roommate, Zach Braff.
 What? Who told you that? Well, yes.
 I do know how to clog.
 But I don't think anybody wants to see me do that.
 You do? Really? Okay.
 You're a weird guy, Kenneth.
 See you tomorrow, Mr.
 O'Brien.
   

                




                    			- Hey Hi, babe.
 Dennis, what are you doing? I'm gonna mount a TV on your wall.
 I just can't find a stud.
 So you made nine holes in my wall? No, those are for the shelves, dummy.
 The TV is gonna go right here.
 It's gonna be awesome.
 It's gonna be-- It's gonna be like a hospital.
 Oh, Dennis, I don't want a hospital TV.
 I don't want a shelf Whose horse is that? That's my cousin Teddy's Great Dane.
 I told him I'd watch him for a couple weeks.
 'cause Teddy broke his ankle running from some black guys that pulled a gun on him.
 Now, why is it important to tell me that the muggers were black? They weren't muggers.
 They were cops.
 So why don't you just say he was running from some cops? I don't know, I mean, you're a racist for assuming that they weren't cops.
 Uhh! You know I'm allergic to dogs.
 Ack, allergies are all mental.
 Hey.
 Who the hell is this? That's Teddy.
 Get out.
 I want you out of here! You can't kick me out.
 I love you! No, no, get your stuff and get out.
 I'm not doing this anymore.
 You can't kick me out.
 I got squatter's rights.
 Which is it: you love me or you got squatter's rights? I don't see why they're mutually exclusive! Ohh! Thank you.
 Oh, Liz, finally.
 It's about time you broke up with him.
 He's a comple loser.
 Oh, Jenna, don't say that.
 You know, he had some good moments.
 Hi.
 I got donuts.
 What's up, brown eyes? I made chili.
 Hey You wanna wanna order cheese steaks? I guess they were mostly food related.
 But he was always nice to me.
 Oh, that's okay.
 Cry it out, sister.
 No, I'm not crying.
 I'm allergic to the stupid Great Dane.
 That thing licked my eyes this morning.
 Wait a minute.
 Dennis and the dog are still in your apartment? I gave him a week to find a new place.
 Ugh.
 We're completely broken up.
 If that's true, then I'm taking you out to celebrate.
 A girls' night.
 We'll meet some new people.
 Oh, you mean like at a discotheque? Oh, boy.
 So when can we see each other again? What are you wearing? Black dress? Black stockings? A funeral, oh.
 I'm sorry, okay.
 Let me call you back in an hour yeah, bye.
 Why are you cryig? The Liberty lose again last night? I'm not crying.
 I have allergies.
 Allergies are all in the mind, Lemon.
 I use to have a wicked peanut allergy.
 And now, witness.
 As I'm sure you surmised from that call, I'm seeing a woman of late.
 Yeah, who's the lucky lady? Let's just say she's a high-ranking African-American member of the Bush administration.
 Are you dating Condoleeza Rice? I'm not at liberty to say.
 The point is, my lady friend is an egghead, much like yourself.
 Not my usual thing, and I need your advice.
 We're having a lot of trouble connecting lately.
 She does a lot of traveling.
 Yeah, and it must be hard for her to get cell phone reception when she's so far up the president's butt.
 I'm choosing to ignore that remark on the basis that you are a godless, glassy-eyed Clintonista.
 Now, I wanted to get my friend something personal.
 Do you think she would prefer this handsome attaché, which says, "You are a woman of substance, and I respect you," or this collection of ladies' unmentionables with snaps and openings all over the place? Attaché! I see, okay.
 Jenna to the floor, please.
 Yeah, it's pretty good.
 But I think the boobs should swing more.
 Yeah, then I could go: Rodney, don't make me come over there and beat you in the head with one of my boom-booms!" Yeah.
 This is just appalling.
 What's your problem? I just think it's demeaning for a black man to do drag.
 What? Everybody loves a dude in a dress.
 I mean, those are the best Bugs Bunnies.
 Frank, there are large pockets of African-American culture that  Caucasians know nothing about.
 The stigma of drag is one of them.
 Whatever.
 I've played a woman before.
 Hunky Grandma Be Trippin' made $96 million.
 All I'm saying is-- is drag is a way for Caucasians to emasculate you and make you seem non-threatening.
 We never would have stooped so low on Black Frasier.
 Black Frasier? Niles, this Beaujolais is impeccable.
 It's both fruity and precocious.
 That's not the only thing around here that's fruity and precocious.
 I never heard of Black Frasier.
 What? It was huge on BET.
 Every Thursday night at about 9:00 or 9:15.
 Think about it, Tracy.
 All the best African-American comedians refuse to do drag.
 Chris Rock doesn't do it.
 Dr.
 Cosby doesn't do it.
 Bernie Mac doesn't do it 'cause he'd be ugly as hell.
 Forget it.
 I'm not wearing this dress.
 It's prejudicial.
 Thanks a lot.
 Now what am I supposed to do with this sketch? I'll do it.
 I mean, my parents raised me as a girl for, like, ten years.
 What? I told you guys that.
 That's our show for tonight! See you next week! Good night! That's okay, we'll think of something.
 All right, I'll see you.
 Monday night is girls' night.
 I'm taking you out, 9:30.
 I know this great karaoke place where you can get a pedicure while you sing.
 Oh, Jenna, I'll go anywhere.
 Just,  please, no more karaoke.
 Not after our last duet.
 When I'm right here, you need to be here.
 Not here.
 Here is embarrassing.
 Okay, fine.
 I didn't say that.
 I said you're a beautiful woman.
 It wouldn't hurt to try something different with your hair.
 Check this out.
 I think Jack is dating Condi Rice.
 Oh, God, that's huge! Oh, no, no.
 I never said braces.
 I said bonding.
 Dude, that Shamanda character was the best thing of the night.
.
 What was her line? Say it again.
 Rodney! Don't make me come over there and beat on you with my boom-booms! You burned me! There's nothing wrong with a black comedian wearing a dress.
 Eddie does it, Martin does it, Jamie Foxx, Flip Wilson.
 Whoopi Goldberg does it every day! You stole a franchise from me! Shamanda could have been a movie! Okay, you need to write something great for him before this becomes a problem.
 I wouldn't even know where to begin writing for a guy like that.
 Then write something with him.
 Our comedy gotta do more than make people laugh.
 Gotta make people think.
 I wanna hold a mirror up to society, and then win world record for biggest mirror.
 He's totally right.
 Gotta be raw! Uh-huh.
 I got a concept for a sketch I think you might like.
 You and Jenna play Sleestaks from Land of the Lost and you're trying to get a small business loan.
 What? Because you want to open up a pancake house called Slee's Stacks.
 Are you black? Jack, is everything all right? I think I figured out why things have been so rocky with my lady friend.
 I'm on the street.
 I can barely hear you.
 She's cheating on me, Liz.
 I think there's another man in the picture.
 Are you sure, Jack? 'Cause she kind of seems like an honest lady.
 I know what I know.
 Next time I see Putin, I'm gonna kick his teeth in.
 Oh, here it is! Izzle.
 "A suffix that can be used to take the place of anything.
" Well, now you're just being patronizzle.
 You know who would love this argument? My racist grandfather.
 I thought writing with you was gonna be like two brothers writing together.
 We're not even speaking the same language.
 That's right.
 I'm speaking English.
 Just listen, just listen.
 Come on, who raised you? Standing there with your pants that fit.
 Using a wallet.
 Drinking Starbucks.
 And what is this? That's my Harvard a capella group the Crocodillos.
 I had a solo in Like A Prayer.
 Come on! Where's your heritage? My brother! My homeboy! My n-- Hey, sorry I'm late.
 Thank God you're here.
 This place is creeping me out.
 I don't think I can do this.
 You're gonna be great.
 They're cute.
 Do  you think they're Wall Street guys? Yeah, I think they're from the firm of Date-Rape, Coke-ington Cheeseball, and Jag.
 You've got to give this a chance.
 Excuse me.
 Is this seat taken? Oh, really, dude? I gotta move my coat? There's like four empty seats down there.
 Can't you just be cool? Ugh.
 That guy wanted to buy you a drink.
 Really? I already have a drink.
 Do you think he'd buy me mozzarella sticks? What is the matter with you? I don't know! I'm just nervous and rusty.
 Well, just relax and be yourself.
 Can I have a martini, please? Hi.
 Oh, he knows where Bin Laden is, come on! The Carlyle Group.
 The Unocal Pipeline.
 The assassination of Olof Palme.
 Come on, the proof is in the pudding.
 Ooh, these are good.
 Really, you think she looks like Jessica Simpson? You could put a long, blonde wig on a ferret and it would like Jessica Simpson.
 And by the way, Jessica Simpson would think that you are old and gross.
 So good luck with that.
 I really didn't think I was gonna meet anybody tonight, but you and I have so much in common.
 Also, you have really pretty eyes.
 Oh, hi.
 I learned the truth at seventeen.
 That love was meant for beauty queens.
 Hey, you're bumming us out.
 And high school girls with clear skin smiles.
 Who married young and then retired.
 Whoa I thought bars were open till 4:00.
 Nope, 11:30.
 Let's get you to bed.
  from human resources.
 Hi.
 He told me that Toofer filed the harassment complaint against Tracy.
 What? Now I have to attend sensitivity training.
 What seems to be the problem, Toofer? Mr.
 Jordan called me the N-word.
 And? And I was really offended.
 Because Because it's a racial slur.
 Brothers talk to other brothers like that.
 I was being friendly.
 Yes, Toofer.
 You see, in the last decade or so the African-American community has re-appropriated that word as a way of depriving it of its meaning.
 Just don't try to tell my girlfriend that.
 Yeah, Toofer, I really don't think Tracy was trying to offend you.
 It's okay for us to use it with each other.
 You can call me that.
 It's a term of endearment.
 Look, I'm not trying to cause any trouble.
 And I confess I appreciate what you do for the show.
 I want you to be my brother, my homeboy, my n-- Whoa! This meeting is adjourned.
 No cool, homie! You might as well spread me down with a fire hose.
 Just sounds so hateful coming from you! Ugh! I wish to file a complaint.
 Hey.
 Dennis, what are you doing here? Hey, I'm moving into my new apartment.
 So I got one last thing to say to you, and then I'll be out of your life forever.
 "Dear Liz Lemon, "While other women have bigger boobs than you, "no woman has as big a heart.
 "When I saw you getting ready to go out "and get nailed by a bunch of guys last night, "I knew for sure it was over between us.
 "And for the first time since the '86 World Series, I cried".
 "I cried like a big dumb homo".
 "And if it was up to me, we would be together forever.
 "But there's a new thing called 'women's liberation' "which gives you women the right to choose, "and you have chosen to abort me.
 "And that I must live with.
 "So tonight when you arrive home, I'll be gone.
 I officially renounced my squatter's rights.
" I'll always love you.
 Good-bye and good luck.
 I'll never forget you.
 And that is why we are no longer a couple.
 The guy just came in here and bared his soul to you.
 What are you, made of stone? Am I crazy? The guy's a disaster, right? Well, I don't know.
 I mean, yeah, he's a little "bridge and tunnel," but you did say you had some good times.
 No, no, no, he had his bad moments too.
 Hey.
 Threesome? How about it, huh? Mmm! I'm just saying after last night maybe he's not such a bad choice.
 You are suggesting that I get back with Dennis.
 Maybe.
 Look, you're a writer.
 Write a list of Dennis' pros and cons.
 It's a very helpful exercise.
 It's how I decided to get a scooter instead of a bike.
 Ah.
 Well, you have to admit there's always time for Tony Blair.
 There's always time for Bashar al-Assad.
 But there's never any time for Jack Donaghy, and that's a problem.
 Go ahead, take the call, yeah.
 Hey, Dennis, you drop by to say hi to Liz? You mean the ex-future Mrs.
 Dennis? She dumped me again.
 I'm sorry to hear that.
 Yeah, you know, you try to make some people happy, but it doesn't work all the time.
 Tell me about it.
 What, you? I really can't go into detail.
 It's about when my woman and I are together, it's mindblowing.
 It's, uh It's filthy, really.
 So what's the problem? Well, she works all the time.
 She's always traveling, it's a headache.
 Who needs that? That's why I'm always dating 20-year-olds.
 Nah, let me tell you about Half of them are 16.
 You want some advice? It's hard for alpha males like you and me to put our egos aside, but if she's worth it, you make it work.
 It's like my cousin Teddy's dog.
 Sometimes he just doesn't wanna lick my feet.
 So what I do is, I hide my feet from him for a couple of days, and then when he sees them, he goes bananas.
 So Jack, in this example, Liz is the dog.
 And I am my feet.
 You see what I'm saying? Yes, I believe I do.
 Each of you is here because you are insensitive to a co-worker, okay? You might've used one of the words I call the "uh-oh" words.
 Such as, slut.
 Ho.
 Uh, bitch.
 Biyatch.
 Queerburger.
 Faggotron.
 Gaybird.
 Uh, the word for black in any language, Néro, noir, schwartz, negro, kam-an-sek.
 Hmm? So.
 What else? What else can we not call each other? How 'bout sweaty greaseball? Ooh, very good.
 That's highly offensive.
 Person of color.
 Guess if you say it like that.
 Sneaky Taiwanese tranny who stole my watch.
 Ho-ho! Yes! These words are terrible.
 But today, we are going to learn to communicate in a different way.
 And I would like to start with Tracy and James.
 Guys? Now, I understand that the two of you got into a big 'ol conflict yesterday.
 Andlet's work this out.
 Tracy.
 What did you really want to say to James? I'm tryin' to tell him he's my brother.
 We're the only two blacks on the show.
 We have to figure out a way to work together.
 Like professor Martin Luther King said, I have a feeling.
 It's Dr.
 Martin Luther King, and he did not have a feeling, he had a dream.
 Ah, dude wear khakis.
 Uncle Tom, party of one.
 Uncle Tom, party of one.
 You can't call someone that if you've never read the book! What  book? You know what I think? I think you're ashamed of being black, and you're an embarrassment to your community! I embarrass you.
 You embarrass me, and you know why? Because there are racist people in this world, and when they see you act like a fool, they assume we're all fools.
 That's it! This is it.
 This is the sketch we should do.
 What? Right here, you and me! This is deep stuff goin' on.
 We gotta write this.
 You're right.
 Ah-ha-ha! Dr.
 Snoo, thank you very much! Smew.
 Oh.
 Oh.
 Okay.
 That's really against the rules.
 Dennis? Oh, my God.
 "I know this might be emotional for you, so there's a meatball sub in the fridge.
" Oh! "Pro.
 Fixed TV.
" Huh.
 Hello, I'm Star Jones.
 And welcome to the Star Jones Gastric Bypass Cooking Show.
 Mmm.
 Liz, what happened to the race relations sketch Tracy and I wrote? Oh, we only had time for one more bit, and Tracy picked this.
 I'm sorry.
 Now you know, I can only eat small portions.
 Oh, my goodness! Dessert.
 Okay, he's right, this is funnier.
 Guess where I was last night.
 Mark Foley's pajama party.
 No.
 Kandahar.
 Afghanistan? Yeah.
 Took the corporate jet to hook up with my neo-con inamorata.
 Well, I'm glad things are working out for you and your mystery lady.
 Well actually, they're not.
 I broke up with her.
 Really? What happened? Well, I finally realized that we're not compatible.
 I mean, I'm all for fantasy role-play, but Abu-Ghraib? Well, you know, relationships end.
 Peoplemove on.
 But I'm glad at least I gave it a shot.
 Thank Dennis for making me do that.
 Dennis? Yep.
 You know, I might've been too hard on that guy.
 He's okay.
 Hmm.
 "Jack likes Dennis.
 "Jack likes Dennis.
" At Snapple, when young fruit ripens, they may want to combine with other fruit.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 I just, um, just wanted to drop off your Christmas present.
 I had already bought it for you, so Oh It's a fancy briefcase, you know, 'cause you're classy and important.
 Like a dude.
 Thank you, Dennis.
 I, uh, also got you some antihistamine.
 In case the next guy you're with, you know, has a dog and you wanna stay with him.
 Anyway.
 Do wanna eat? What? I got all this Chinese food.
 I'm never gonna finish it by myself, so For real? Should I, um, grab a plate? Yeah.
 Get me a diet soda.
 Okay.
 Good evening and welcome to Dateline.
 Chris Hansen has our latest investigation-- Hello? Good evening, sir.
 I'm Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC.
 Can I ask you what you're doing here tonight? Oh, yeah, I'm here to boff some chick named Mary.
 Boff some chick-- Oh, my God.
 Do you know how old Mary is? Yeah, uh, 22.
 I think.
 You wanna try again? Crap.
 That girl said she was 16, but I swear to God I could tell she was 22.
 Get out of my apartment! This happened while we were broken up.
 No, no, no, no.
 I was right about you! This is a con, by the way.
 You on Dateline is a con! You know what? I knew you wouldn't be cool about this.
 We're finished.
 You can't break up with me.
 I already broke up with you! Fine! Then we agree to disagree!   

                




                    			Well, I don't know why they need you in the studio.
 Surprise! Oh, my God! Is this for me? I can't believe you made all this fuss over my birthday.
 It's so incredibly thoughtful.
 Let me give something back to you guys.
 * I believe the children are our future * * Teach them well and let them lead the way * Hey, guess what, everyone? I'm engaged.
 Engaged? Hey, this isn't gonna change the way you dress or eat lollipops, is it? No.
 Oh, then congratulations.
 This is for you, Cerie.
 * I believe the children are our future * * Teach them well and let them lead the way * * Show them * All the beauty they possess * Everyone, guess what? There's an antique car show out in the plaza! How long is Jack gonna be? He's still on the phone.
 Area code 407? Oh, no.
 When did this happen? It's fine.
 It's gonna be just fine.
 Jonathan, these cheap phones keep on shattering! You can go in now.
 No.
 Who let 407 through? Jonathan, we have drills for this! Liz distracted me.
 No, I didn't.
 What's going on? Business got you down? Business doesn't get me down.
 Business gets me off.
 Now, what is your urgent problem this time? Well, the writers and I wanted to get TGS jackets, but the guy in accounting says that we can't have the jackets.
 But Dateline has jackets.
 Jackets? Is this what you're talking about now? Jackets? Lemon, do you realize that your little show accounts for Hello?! Now, would you do me a kindness, please? And handle your problems yourself and stop bothering me.
 Is that too much to ask? Absolutely! Forget it.
 I won't bother you about anything anymore.
 Wow, he's a little bit of a stress eater, huh? He puts up with so much.
 All right.
 Liz, you shoulda seen this guy at the club last night.
 Everybody at this party is a Jedi.
 We must get our freak on while our fruit is a-plentiful.
 Oh, naw! Oh, sounds like another great party I wasn't invited to.
 Tracy, thank you for the funnest night of my life! Love you, man.
 I love you too, J Bird! Yo, I don't like that dude.
 It's disrespectful when he imitates me.
 I want him fired.
 Oh, come on, it's a goof.
 How would you like it if I did an impression of you, Liz Lemon? Hi, I'm Liz Lemon! I like to wear man shirts.
 Watch me skateboard.
 I don't skateboard.
 Hurts, doesn't it? I'm not firing Josh.
 You always take his side.
 Tracy, stop tasering him.
 See? I need to be respected, Liz Lemon.
 What do you know about respect? Please, Tracy, just let it go.
 Well, if you won't do anything about it, then I'll just go over your head to Donaghy.
 No, no no, do not do that.
 Don't bother him.
 I'll talk to Josh.
 Hey, Cerie, what are you doing? Oh, I let them do my make-up sometimes.
 They say it's fun for them.
 She's like a Barbie.
 Oh, sorry, my babysitter got jury duty.
 I think I'm going to kill myself.
 So, Cerie, how long have you known this guy that you're marrying? It'll be two months in three weeks.
 You'd love him, Liz.
 He's so funny.
 He does this thing where he screams at limo drivers.
 Yeah, it just kind of seems like you're rushing into it a little bit.
 I guess.
 But we both wanna have babies while it's still cool.
 I already have all the names picked out.
 If it's a girl, Bookcase.
 Or Sandstorm.
 Or maybe Hat.
 But that's more of a boy's name.
 Yeah, I was gonna say.
 It's just, you're so young, Cerie.
 There's no big hurry to have babies.
 I mean, there are other things in life.
 Like having a career.
 And working.
 Andhaving a job.
 And working.
 You can have a career anytime.
 But you only have a really short period where you can be a young, hot mom.
 If you wait too long, you could be like Oh, I'm sorry.
 Are you 50 now? Paul Newman or Robert Redford? I've told you 1,000 times, Newman.
 Because  I enjoy his salad dressings and lemonade.
 Me too.
 Okay, uh, Brad Pitt or George Clooney? Do you think I'd be a good mother? What? Something is kicking in.
 And the last few months I've just started wondering if I'm ever gonna have a baby.
 I mean, I'm so many steps away from being able to do it.
 And I panic that maybe I waited too long.
 What if my junk goes bad? What if Cerie is right? Wow, red wine is not your drink.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm in my right mind.
 I just--it comes in waves, you know? And I love my job and I love my friends.
 And if I am meant to crank out a kid, then I have plenty of time.
 Uh, not really.
 Jenna! No, Liz, I'm just saying.
 If this is something you really want, let's go for it.
 I'll help you.
 Please, let me help you for once.
 We'll get you a guy.
 Like that hot dancer Madonna used to have Lourdes.
 No no no.
 That is not how I roll.
 Forget I said anything.
 Because you agreed to this.
 I did not make you sign anything.
 I will not be intimidated by you! Good morning, Mr.
 Donaghy! Go to hell.
 No, thank you.
 Kenneth, I'm sorry.
 How do you do it, Kenneth? How do you sit here every day taking crap from people and you keep smiling? My mother always told me that even when things seemed bad there's someone else who's having a worse day.
 Like being stung by a bee or getting a splinter.
 Or being chained to a wall in someone's sex dungeon.
 Isn't that a kick in the soft stuff, Kenneth? I  mean, you gain strength from your mother while mine is sucking the life out of me.
 She calls me constantly.
 That was her.
 That was her.
 Complaining about where she's living.
 Threatening to move in with me.
 Oh, how wonderful.
 No no no, that's not wonderful.
 I run companies.
 Plural.
 But to that woman I'm always gonna be the punk kid who cried when Pop was run over by a mail truck.
 Oh my, a mailman killed your dad? No, Pop was my dog.
 My dad left when I was two so I grew up calling my Collie Pop.
 My mother is my best friend.
 My mother tried to send me to Vietnam to make a man out of me.
 I was 12.
 Well, my mother has her dark times too.
 But that's when I tell her, "Mama, you carried me for nine months.
 Let me carry you now.
" You are a remarkable human being, Kenneth.
 I bought my mother a lovely retirement home.
 In Florida.
 With a tea garden and fake rocks made of foam because she falls down a lot.
 Got everything she needs except a phone.
 I told those people, I made it clear, do not give her a phone.
 It's her.
 It's always her.
 Hello? This is Dr.
 Leo Spaceman.
 Oh, hi, I'm sorry.
 I got this number under fertility in the Writer's Guild Health Manual.
 I'm also listed under meth addiction and child psychiatry.
 So what can I help you with? I should start by saying that I can't personally help you conceive.
 Something happened to me while scuba diving.
 Hey, so Jenna tells us you're looking for a babydaddy.
 She what? Yeah.
 So? So Are you kidding me? Now, okay, before you say no I just wanna say our child would have a leg up getting into Harvard.
 Oh, really? Did you go to Harvard? 'Cause you haven't mentioned it in like three hours.
 Our kid would have strong, flat feet.
 And if you choose me, I agree not to take my shirt off.
 But I do like to get yelled at during sex.
 You're disgusting.
 Yeah, that's a good start.
 Ugh.
 Get out of here.
 Jenna had no business telling you guys that.
 Oh, hey, blue pages.
 What? What's wrong? Jenna told the writers that I'm looking for a guy to get me pregnant.
 Can you believe her? I know.
 It's so uncool.
 I mean, why would she go to them? Who do you know better than me? Oh, come on.
 Didn't you have a vasectomy? No, I just told my wife I did.
 And she doesn't get pregnant how? I fake it.
 Is Jenna out here? Is she rehearsing? She's onstage.
 Excuse me, Ms.
 Lemon? Uh I'm not usually this formal, nor this bold, but I figure time is on neither one of our sides.
 Uh, could you excuse us for a second? I'd kind of like him to stay.
 Very well.
 Ms.
 Lemon Liz I'd like to carry your child if I might.
 I have a small ferret farm about 60 miles north of the city.
 It's not much, but it is self-sufficient.
 I can get cable if you want, 'cause I know how much you like the TV.
 Sometimes  I watch you watching it.
 Think about it.
 Jenna.
 Stop telling everyone I need someone to get me pregnant.
 I'm not telling everyone.
 All right, guys, check this out.
 Oprah and Steadman are the same person.
 You know what? I don't have time for this conversation.
 I don't have time for anything.
 That's why he/she won't run for president.
 Hey, you gotta stop doing that impression.
 Tracy hates it.
 What? But it's funny.
 These guys like it.
 The Mars probe didn't brake.
 It was attacked by a Martian cougar.
 This is how you take care of things, Liz Lemon? I'm going to Jack Donaghy.
 No, no Tracy, please don't do that.
 Too late.
 This is untoward.
 This is not toward! You better fix this, nerd.
 Otherwise, Jack Donaghy is gonna kill me and then he's gonna kill you.
 And then he's gonna fold us up in a pizza and eat us.
 What? Hey Liz! I heard you're looking for a hook-up.
 Oh, you know what? Everybody, stop working right now! I don't wanna have sex with any of you.
 I have plenty of time to have a baby.
 And I am not looking for sperm donors.
 Okay.
 But do you still want a sound hook-up so you can listen to rehearsal? Yeah, thanks.
 How are you, Bobby? Good? Great.
 Yo! Tracy.
 It's Jack Donaghy.
 I hear we have a problem with Josh Gerard.
 Damn right! Keeps impersonating me.
 Making me into a caricature.
 Well, I would take care of this if I could.
 But it's tricky.
 You see, Josh's father's an assassin with the Russian mafia.
 They call him El Matador.
 Whoa.
 Those dudes are crazy.
 Forget it, I don't need any of that noise.
 It  happys me to hear you say that.
 For being so understanding.
 I'm sending you our new super top secret invisible motorcycle.
 For reals? [laughing] For realses.
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to see a doctor.
 I keep pooping during sex.
 Lemon, we have a problem.
 I have this whole Tracy/Josh thing under control.
 What are you talking about? Nothing.
 What are you talking about? You.
 You yelling at the crew.
 You trolling for seed.
 Oh, it's a big misunderstanding.
 Jenna thinks that I want to have a baby.
 I should have known this was going to be a problem when I decided to mentor a woman.
 No, in fact, what I said was that my body is trying to make me think I wanna have a baby.
 But my body is not the boss of me.
 My brain is.
 All right, if you insist upon going all Murphy Brown on me, let me give you a tip.
 Don't smother your child with affection to compensate for not having a man in your life.
 Don't say you're the only man I'll ever love.
 Even babies know that's creepy.
 Of course.
 Don't put little notes in their lunch bag that say, "Mommy's watching you.
" People find those things.
 I bet you behaved yourself, though.
 If your child is a terrific hockey player and a gifted flautist, don't make them play the National Anthem on the flute in front of their teammates.
 Your mother did that? Now she wants to move in with me.
 I can't have that, Lemon.
 Then be an adult and call her and say you love her very much.
 But that living together is not going to work for you.
 Oh, no.
 You don't know my mother.
 This is a woman that actually had a heart attack to prevent me from going on my honeymoon.
 Maybe her heart broke because she spent 20 years raising you and you're a total ingrate.
 That's exactly what she said.
 Is this what you want, Lemon, to breathe life into another human being just to spend the rest of your days slowly sucking it out of them? No, that's why my brain is the boss.
 Speak of the devil.
 Take a breath.
 Be nice.
 Hello, Mother.
 So nice to hear your voice.
 No, I am not on anything.
 I know that things have been difficult for you lately and I was thinking you carried me for nine months.
 Let me carry you now.
 Well, right back at you, Colleen! Yeah, that's right! You cut Pop's balls off! And left him in the street to die! Liz, check out my wedding dress.
 Absolutely not, young lady.
 Kenneth, get Donaghy on the phone.
 Jonathan, I have Tracy Jordan for Mr.
 Donaghy.
 No.
 No no no no.
 Tracy, please.
 Do not bother Jack.
 He is in a weird place right now.
 Bebe Jackson's condo? No.
 A children's clothing store in Dubai? Stop guessing! What I'm saying is, leave Jack alone.
 Too late, Liz Lemon.
 He called me five minutes ago.
 Five minutes ago I was with him.
 How did he sound? What did he say? Nothing unusual.
 Russian mobs, invisible motorcycles Sex pooping.
 Are you insane? What are you gonna do when Tracy asks Jack for his invisible motorcycle? Uh Yeah, dummy.
 Here's what you're gonna do.
 It's not your mother.
 Hello? Donaghy! What's up, Tray? If in the future In the future If I mention anything crazy If I mention anything crazy Like an invisible motorcycle Like an invisible motorcycle It means I'm off my meds It means I'm off my meds and should be ignored.
 should be ignored.
 Also, I think Josh Gerard is a young Alex Guinness.
 Go back on your meds, Tracy.
 Hang up.
 Hang up.
 What? What? Idiot.
 Idiot.
 Tracy, I've gotta go.
 Idiot.
 I think that went well.
 Now you gotta call Tracy as Jack.
 Or I could call him as Christopher Walken.
 Do you not understand what we're doing? Jenna, did you tell Life and Style that your favorite book is the Koran? I just wanted to sound smart.
 Oh, hi, baby! Would you take her for a second? I'm trying to finish her eyes.
 Oh, I'm actually really busy.
 I heard you were baby crazy.
 No.
 Yes, she is.
 Please.
 Oh, for the love of--nuts.
 Okay.
 Hi! How about that, huh? Yeah, she likes you.
 Go ahead, walk her around.
 Oh, okay.
 Look how pretty I look.
 Who's the cutest baby in the world? Who's the cutest baby in the world? Who's the cutest baby in the world? How did I get home? Why didn't you say something? Jack Donaghy.
 Now, I know you asked me not to say anything.
 But I think I know somebody that can help you with your sex poop problem.
 Hi.
 Please don't hurt me.
 I can't help it.
 It just pours out of me.
 I'm Jack Donaghy.
 I'm important.
 I just bought the moon.
 Oh, my God.
 I'm doing it again.
 What? Mother, I love you too.
 But living together is not gonna work out for me.
 Yes, I went this morning.
 I  don't know, regular consistency? I can't do this.
 Every day for the rest of your or her life.
 And she will outlive you.
 She's like Castro.
 And when you're done with that, call my wife and tell her I'm sorry about what happened with me and Keith and them.
 Wait, who? Oh, God! It's true that you had the baby.
 I don't know what happened.
 One minute I was holding the baby in make-up and then suddenly It was like highway hypnosis.
 You know, when you pull into your driveway but you don't remember driving home? Oh, right right.
 And you have someone else's baby in your car.
 I feel so terrible.
 Give me the baby.
 I'll try to smooth things over.
 What's her name? Well, Anna calls her Isobel, but I call her Nancy.
 I think it might be a good idea if I give Anna the rest of the week off.
 Seriously? We're really busy.
 No, of course.
 Of course.
 Stealing a baby? Really? Hey, I found Isobel! I'm a hero.
 Hi, baby.
 Hi, muffin.
 Oh, I'm so glad you're back.
 You're loving this, aren't you? Oh, yes.
 I'm a big fan of kidnapping.
 Especially by my middle management.
 So the thing you were saying about listening to your mind and not your body, how's that going for you? My body's telling me several things.
 First of all, I need to start working out.
 That kid was killing my arms.
 Number two, I could be very happy with a baby that looks nothing like me and didn't bake in my oven.
 Three, I gotta let myself have a personal life.
 What I've been telling you for five months.
 Well, you're right again.
 Right it down in your little "I'm Awesome" book.
 Where are you going? You have a rehearsal about to start.
 I stole a baby, Jack.
 I'm taking a half day.
 Fair enough.
 I have to do some thinking.
 Maybe it's impossible to have it all.
 Career, the family But if anybody can figure out how to do it, it's me.
 That's going up.
 Oh, nerds! I was talking about you at work today, Mother.
 I think my boss, Mr.
 Jack Donaghy, wishes you were his mother.
 Isn't that something, mother? Yes, Kenneth, that's sweet.
 Do you have me on speaker phone again? Yes, Ma'am! It's just like Charlie's Angels! Oh, by the way, did you get your old Halloween decorations I sent you? Oh, yes, thank you! I'm looking at the kooky skeleton right now.
 I love it! You're the best mother in the whole world! Okay, calm down, dear.
 Yes, Mother.
   

                




                    			The flowers are lovely.
 Thank you.
 No, you hang up first.
 Okay, on the count of three.
 One, two, three No, I didn't hang up either.
 Donaghy, I need your help.
 I miss you too.
 I said I miss you too.
 You're breaking up.
 Maureen? She cut out.
 I need $60,000, or I'm gonna lose my house.
 Which house? I need $100,000, or I'm gonna lose both my houses! Tracy, I don't understand.
 You've starred in 14 films.
 You don't have any money saved? Nah, I lost all of it.
 Really? Who's your money manager? Grizz.
 Worldcom, man.
 Worldcom.
 Look, Tracy, I can't just give you money.
 But what I can do is show you how you can earn all the money you need.
 You must know Arsenio.
 Hall or Billingham? You know someone named Arsenio Billingham? Put his name and face on a product.
 Because of Arsenio's "woof-woof" catchphrase, we settled on dog food.
 The product was a runaway success.
 The company and Arsenio made millions.
 I like that.
 Put my name on something.
 But what would I sell? The product is irrelevant.
 The people aren't buying that.
 They're buying you.
 Now, you come back with an idea of a product you'd be willing to sell, anything at all, and you'll have all the money you can dream of.
 I'm on it.
 I forgot about that Worldcom mess.
 Why you gotta be so obsessed with telecommunications? Get me Maureen Dowd back on the phone, please.
 Hey, I've got to miss an hour of rehearsal today because I just found out from my publicist I've been booked on The View.
 Oh, Jenna, that's great.
 For the first time in your life, you'll be in a room full of women and you'll be the least crazy one.
 I know.
 (Liz) Oh, you know what clip you should show? "MTV: Darfur.
" You and Tracy were really funny in that.
 Oh, this isn't for TGS.
 It's for my movie.
 The Rurr-Jurr has a limited release next week.
 Oh, congratulations! I didn't know they had a release date for The Rurr-- For that movie.
 Oh, sorry.
 Gotta take this.
 Hello? You still don't know what the title is? No! No one does.
 It's gone on way too long to ask her about it.
 This title isn't hard to understand, right? No, it's awesome! I love that we can work while we're on cocaine! Could it be Roar Her, Gem Her? No, that doesn't make any sense.
 It's got to be Oral Germ Whore.
 Okay, bye.
 Sorry, that was my publicist.
 You know, I have to admit, I kind of like that Tracy Jordan is no longer the only movie star on TGS.
 Maybe I'll finally start getting some respect around here.
 What's up, flabby butt? You look weird today.
 Hey, Pete, you wanna see a comic book with pregnant zombie nuns? Yes, I do.
 Cool.
 And I have a screener of the movie for you.
 I want you to watch it.
 Ah, The Rural Juror! That is something.
 I can't wait to watch it.
 Oh, you won't be disappointed.
 The source material was amazing.
 It's hard to go wrong with a Kevin Grisham novel.
 You mean John Grisham.
 Oh, no.
 Kevin, John's brother.
 Did you know that before Kevin was a novelist, he worked at a recycling center? Wow.
 Yeah, and he just finished writing a sequel.
 It's called Urban Fervor.
 Boy, these titles-- They really make you think.
 Oh, wow! Doesn't it seem like just yesterday we were doing the show back in Chicago, dreaming about being in the movies? We've come a long way from that apartment we shared in Little Armenia.
 Oh, it was so weird there.
 You remember that neighborhood festival where they killed a goat in the street? Yes! But we did have really good luck that year.
 Yeah.
 I need to come up with a big idea for a product to put my name on.
 Something no one has thought of.
 Something crazy.
 I know a gentleman who had a lot of crazy ideas.
 He was a carpenter.
 He wanted everyone to love one another.
 Oh, you mean Jesus? No-- Miguel from set design.
 He's over there.
 Eurek-o! Hey.
 What are you doing back here? They're rehearsing your Paris Hilton sketch.
 I'm trying to avoid Jenna.
 She gave me a screener of her movie.
 And? Oh, Pete, it's awful! I couldn't believe how bad it was.
 Although, I guess it's no surprise that Tony Hawk can't play blind.
 So you must know the title! Yes, yes-- The Rural Juror.
 The Rrr-- Rural.
 The Ruh-- Rural.
 Eh.
 (Pete) So, what are you gonna do about Jenna? (Liz) Same thing I've always done when she's done something terrible.
 Think of one thing nice to say and then hug her.
 So, what did you think? Oh, my God! You looked so beautiful.
 The lighting was really neat.
 Ethan and I both thought the programs were really easy to read.
 So, what nice thing are you going to say about The Roaring Junior? Uh, I don't know.
 It's a mess.
 No, you've got to tell them that when Paris Hilton tries to make out with the bear, the bear has to act like he's into it.
 All right.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, stop what you're doing because I'm about to blow your mind! Hit it! Tired of your sandwich making you angry? Then behold the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine! Stick any three meats-- Whatever you want! Bologna, salami, boar-- Whatever! Into this sexy lady and she will melt them all together into one delicious food ball.
 Never again will you have to suffer through the bread part of your sandwich.
 I give you the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine! (all) Meat is the new bread! Uh-huh! What do you think? Well, it's certainly not the worst celebrity product idea I've ever heard.
 Hi, I'm Whoopi Goldberg.
 And you're Working Out With Whoopi.
 With Tracy Jordan behind this, it just might work.
 We'll roll it out in time for Christmas.
 Manufacture it for four bucks, slap your name on it, and sell it for 50.
 So GE will produce the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine? Oh, no.
 No.
 GE could never make something so, um Unique.
 We'll have to pass this off to one of our subsidiaries.
 You see, GE owns KitchenAll of Colorado, which, in turn, owns JMI of Stanford, which is a majority shareholder in Pokerfastlane.
com, which recently acquired the Sheinhardt Wig Company, which owns NBC outright.
 NBC owns Winnipeg Iron Works which owns the Ahp Chanagi Party Meats corporation of Pyongyang, North Korea.
 And they will make the Meat Machine.
 Jack Donaghy, you are the best.
 (Tracy) You know what? I'm gonna make you a mix tape.
 You like Phil Collins? I've got two ears and a heart, don't I? All right, Jenna's on next.
 Everyone shut up so we can hear the title of this stupid movie.
 And coming up, I'll be talking to The Girlie Show star Jenna Maroney about her upcoming project, The Rrr-Jrr.
 That is not helpful.
 Hey, do you know the name of Jenna's movie yet? Oh, yeah, she gave me a screener.
 Okay! No, no, no-- I'm not telling you anything about it.
 I'm not giving you more ammunition to make fun of her with.
 So it's bad.
 How bad? Please! Just give us one detail.
 Okay, fine.
 Jenna plays a southern lawyer named Constance Justice.
 You gotta let us see this.
 No! Come on, Liz! No! Oh, man.
 Constance Justice.
 Justice has been served.
 Good stuff.
 Tracy to the stage please for Pull Your Own Wisdom Teeth.
 (Jenna) Oh, excuse me.
 Hey, there you are.
 So, what did you think of the movie? Oh, my God, Jenna! The soundtrack was so moody.
 What else did you like about it? What? Oh, um You were good! Your face was very expressive.
 And another cool part wasthe trees.
 I gotta get back to work.
 You didn't like the movie.
 What? Yes, I just said I like the movie.
 No, you didn't.
 You did that condescending compliment thing you always do.
 What? When have I ever done that? So, what did you think? Oh, my God You looked beautiful.
 The lighting was really neat.
 Ethan and I both thought the programs were really easy to read.
 Well, that's not how I remember any of that.
 Look, Liz, for once, be honest with me.
 I want your real opinion.
 Okay, I thought the story was preposterous.
 I thought the acting was way over the top.
 And I thought it was about an hour too long.
 It's only 90 minutes.
 It's kind of a train wreck.
 A train wreck? Okay.
 I'm not trying to be a jerk here.
 You asked me for my opinion.
 No, no-- I understand.
 Thank you.
 I wasn't kidding about how cool those trees were, though.
 What were they? Oaks? Damn it! Where are my car keys? Jack, Tracy-- What can I do for you? Leo, we have a product we want you to give a medical endorsement to.
 I'll do it! What is it? It's called the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine.
 It's a dual-press grill.
 Say no more.
 If it's giving people meat, then I'm onboard.
 I've always said humans need more animal blood.
 It keeps the spine straight.
 We appreciate it, Leo.
 You boys need anything while you're here? Some reds, yellows Just got some purples in from Peru.
 No, I'm good.
 Well, it would be rude not to take, uh One or two.
 Now, The Rrr Jrr is the true story of Rory Jerner, whose pure furor ensures a terrible murder-- Excuse me.
 I feel like I'm getting further away from it.
 Hey, last night I broke into Liz's office.
 I got Jenna's movie.
 Oh, how'd you get in there? That weird security guard Tony let me in.
 I also looked on Liz's computer.
 Her last two Google searches were for singles yoga and scalp pain.
 That is grim.
 The Rural Juror? Man, that's disappointing.
 I had to let Tony watch me pee to get that tape.
 What? Hey, you wanted to see me? Yeah, I don't want to wear this Paris Hilton nose.
 (Liz) I'm sorry.
 You have to wear the nose.
 There's a whole bunch of jokes in the sketch about the nose.
 Well, to be perfectly honest, I think the entire sketch is a train wreck.
 Oh, I see.
 We're not talking about the nose.
 We're talking about the movie.
 You're wrong about it, Liz.
 It's getting some very positive early reviews.
 Teenmoviescene.
com gave it five out of five iPods.
 Jenna, believe what you want.
 I'm your friend.
 I'm telling you the truth.
 Please-- Here's what's really going on.
 It's killing you that I'm in something good that you had nothing to do with.
 And now you're taking it out on me.
 Oh, come on! Well, enjoy kicking me around for now, Liz.
 Because I won't be on your crappy little show forever.
 Really? Really.
 Really? Really.
 Really? Really.
 Well, Jenna, I'm sorry you feel that way.
 Ow! What the hell? Oh, God, I'm sorry! I didn't know there was a person in there! Pete, could you tell Liz Lemon not to stand in my eyeline while I'm rehearsing, please? Pete, could you tell Jenna she smells like a stripper? So, uh Are you guys still fighting? We've reached kind of an understanding.
 She's not talking to me.
 And to retaliate, I'm writing impressions for her that she can't do.
 I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
 You guys can't go on like this.
 You have to apologize to her.
 I didn't do anything wrong! She insisted on me telling her what I thought of her crappy movie.
 And then she attacked me.
 Liz, I can't have the head writer and one of the stars of the show fighting.
 I can barely keep a lid on the feud going on between Kenneth and Dougie from props.
 Audience, let me ask you a question.
 How many times has this happened to you? Or this: Seem familiar? Bread is one of the worst things in the world.
 But we've always needed it.
 Until now! By burning three different types of meat together, The Tracy Jordan Meat Machine takes bread out of the equation! Now your sandwich is all of the good stuff.
 That's delicious! And it's healthy.
 Hi, I'm Doctor Leo Spaceman.
 I'm a working physician with a degree from the Ho Chi Minh City School of Medicine.
 Doctor Space-man, is it true that bread eats away at your brain? We have no way of knowing because the powerful bread lobby keeps stopping my research! Well, folks, bread will never maybe attack your brain again! Because with the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine-- Say it with me now! (all) Meat is the new bread! Where did you guys get this tape? Oh, Josh broke into your office.
 You went in my office without permission? Because I'm worried about your scalp pain.
 Hello, everyone.
 Frank, could you tell Liz-- Nope, not interested.
 Girl writer, could you tell Liz that I don't-- Jenna, stop this.
 It's stupid.
 Let's just go in my office and talk.
 Oh, there is nothing to talk about.
 Stop making this something it isn't.
 I just didn't like the movie because it's bad.
 These guys watched it.
 They'll tell you.
 Actually, we all kind of liked it.
 What? No, you didn't.
 Yeah, we all did.
 It's not the best thing in the world, but it's solid and Jenna's really good in it.
 Thank you, Frank.
 Look! Look at her! She can't stand that I'm in something good.
 It's probably because of her own intellectual insecurities.
 What? Frank, shut up.
 Fine, dismiss me.
 I guess because I look weird, I can't be perceptive.
 I can't believe you like this movie! Oh! Jeez, I hope those two work it out.
 Relax, man.
 As long as they're yapping at each other, we're not working.
 Enjoy it.
 I want these everywhere! I want every person here eating from a Tracy Jordan Meat Machine.
 Ow, ah! Cheese and crackers, that smarts! What happened? The grease burned me, Mr.
 Jordan.
 The machine must be broken.
 That one must be defective.
 Oh, ow! My face! My page jacket! They all must be like that! Where's Donaghy? Can somebody take me to a hospital? Jenna, stop.
 I just want to get past this.
 What do you need me to do? Well, you can start by saying you're sorry.
 To-- Fine.
 I am sorry that I assumed other people would hate the movie just because I hate it.
 That was wrong.
 That's it? That's your apology? Yeah.
 Are we good? We're good.
 Great.
 So, do I have to wear the nose tonight? Yes, you do.
 Okay, well then I hope you get bird flu and die.
 What did you just say to me? You are a big fake, you know that, Liz? She doesn't even need those glasses.
 Really, I'm a fake, blondie? I'm a fake? Burning jets of grease, huh? Were any of our people hurt? Only Kenneth.
 Good.
 What are we gonna do? We can't sell this.
 You're right, we can't sell this in the United States.
 What? We simply have to find a market with lax safety regulations.
 With your international appeal, we can go anywhere.
 How about the Ukraine? Not the Ukraine.
 I own some property on the Dnieper River.
 In Volyn? Closer to Cherkasy.
 Well, we'll find another country then.
 How do you feel about Venezuela? Can't do it, Donaghy.
 I can't put my name on a product that's gonna hurt people.
 That's disappointing.
 Although I admire your integrity.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, they need you on stage immediately.
 Some kind of emergency.
 For crying out loud.
 I'm sorry that we're not all weeping with gratitude at getting to read your words.
 I am so glad I studied voice at Northwestern so I could do raps about Suri Cruise.
 Oh, please! If it wasn't for me, you'd still be slutting it up for car dealership owners so they'd put you in their commercial.
 Oh, so now I'm a slut? Yeah.
 Let me tell you something.
 This slut slept with your brother! Mitch? Yeah, and let me tell you something about Mitch.
 He is disgusting in bed.
 You know he's not right.
 He was in a really bad skiing accident! Ladies.
 Sit down.
 Now, what is this about? It's about my movie, The Rrr Jrr.
 They've adapted The Rural Juror? I'm a huge Kevin Grisham fan.
 Jenna has taken the fact that I don't like her movie and blown it completely out of proportion.
 She twisted my boob.
 Liz, you wanted the movie to be bad.
 You wanted me to fail.
 Okay, let me tell you something, Jenna.
 Liz has always supported you.
 Even when I wanted you out of here, she wouldn't give in.
 I've never seen her so worked up.
 She came at me with that angry little badger face of hers-- There it is right now.
 The point is, she went to the mat for you.
 And she was right.
 I know, but-- But nothing.
 Now you're accusing Liz of undermining you? They did warn me those diet pills were mood altering.
 Yeah? I think you owe her an apology.
 Oh, Liz I'm sorry.
 No, don't be.
 You're right.
 I did want the movie to be bad.
 Wow.
 The one time I try to take your side, Lemon, and you sandbag me.
 I'm sorry, Jenna.
 I smelled crazy in here and I assumed it was you.
 God, Liz, I mean-- I wish you had written my movie too.
 No, it's not that.
 It's just-- The dream that we had in Chicago of getting famous-- We had it.
 It was my dream too, Jenna.
 Yeah, but you couldn't have been serious about acting for a living.
 You have brown hair.
 Look, I like what I do now.
 But there's still this sad little part of me that wants to be the center of attention.
 That wants to get my hair done and get free clothes.
 That wants to be you, I guess.
 And your movie just brought all that stuff up again.
 This is boring.
 I'm bored now.
 Oh, God, Liz.
 I had no idea.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm a jackass.
 No, I'm sorry.
 So you really think I'm beautiful? I never said that.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 Tell me (in russian): Feed me, Whoopi! (all) Whoopi! What's this? I gave the Meat Machine to Whoopi.
 Goldberg or Billingham? Looks like Whoopi's made herself another billion grivka.
 Food ball? Let's get personal.
 Your father Werner was a burger server in suburban Santa Barbara Yes, that's right.
 When he spurned your mother Verna for a curly-haired server named Roberta, did that hurt her? It was hard on all of us, yes.
 I'll always be his little girl.
   

                




                    			That was hillarious! We're back in two minutes! So are you going to ask out the Head? The Head? There are these two MSNBC guys we keep seeing around, and we don't know their names, so we call them the Head and the Hair.
 How come? So what are you, like 6'2"? Wow.
 I see you're looking at my watch.
 What? It's cool, isn't it? That's a Japanese pie watch.
 Oh, okay.
 It tells time with those little pie pieces.
 Each piece is six minutes.
 So right now, it's six times four.
 My watch has these little hands that go around and point at numbers.
 Hey, that's awesome, possum.
 One minute! The point is, the Hair is ridiculously good looking.
 It's true.
 He makes me nervous just to be around.
 And the Head is perfectly harmless and totally into Ms.
 Liz Lemon.
 Hmm Not as much as he's into his pie watch.
 I think the Head sounds perfect for you right now.
 I mean, low pressure, high nerd factor, come on.
 If you're serious about getting your personal life on track, you need to work at it.
 Okay, fine! I'll ask him out.
 I win.
 No, the French maid werewolf thing is cut.
 You're supposed to be Hillary Clinton right now.
 What? Pete! Gary! Lutz! What do you think sounds like the better idea for a new show? A talk show without a host, just the voice of the dead lady from Desperate Housewives, or a reality show with a lot of super hot nannies who move into a house and help fat kids lose weight? Never mind.
 This television programming stuff is just one unpredictable ass ache, and I want you to get it out of here.
 Kenneth, please.
 Come in.
 Is this about the clementine I took off the actors' snack table? Because the catering lady already talked to me.
 No, no.
 No, I wanted to talk to you about our corporate "Bottoms Up" day.
 Once a year, all the Senior VPs spend one day doing the job of one of our lowest level employees.
 Last year I was a welder at one of our locomotive factories, and I made this.
 And this year, I'll be a page for a day, and you'll be my boss.
 Thank you, sir.
 That's how the "Bottoms Up" program works.
 I'm going to be your bottom, Kenneth.
 And I want you to ride me as hard as you can.
 Dude, this party was messed up! They had girls dancing in cages.
 And not the go-go cages, the little dog cages that you crate pit bulls in.
 That is awesome.
 That is upsetting.
 That is awesome.
 It couldn't have been that great a party.
 You're on time to work for the first time ever.
 January 17th.
 Write it down, Cerie.
 It's historic.
 How dare you, Liz Lemon? I'm not arriving to work.
 I left the party on a bacon run.
 Write it down, Cerie.
 January 17th.
 Just like every other day.
 Oh, what's today's date? January 17th.
 Yeah.
 Ah, dammit! I knew this was going to happen.
 Toofer, pass me some paper.
 What's wrong? My autobiography is due tomorrow.
 Morning, boss.
 I'm sorry I'm late.
 Well, don't let it happen again.
 Are you ready for an exciting and challenging day? You bet.
 (Tracy) Yo! Me, Toofer, and Frank are gonna be writing my book all day long, and I think my snake is sick, so I need you to go out to my car and rub his belly 'til he poops.
 Our first assignment.
 This is so annoying.
 I just went down to the ATM to get money, and it gave me a hundred-dollar bill.
 So? So? It's like having Confederate money.
 No one's going to take that.
 Whatever.
 It'll give you something interesting to talk to the Head about.
 Oh, yeah.
 Am I doing that? Yeah, right now.
 Hi, can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for the Head? The  head of what? Yeah, how am I going to do this? Hi.
 What are you doing up here? Oh, Chris Matthews owes me ten bucks.
 Yeah, you'll never get that.
 My name is Gray, by the way.
 You know, it's kind of funny.
 My friend Jenna and I didn't know your name, so we've been calling you the Hair.
 The Hair? How would you like it if I called you Glasses? I would be fine with that.
 Oh, good, because that's what I've been calling you.
 Which was no help when I was trying to find your extension.
 Why were you trying to find my extension? I have a friend who's opening up a new restaurant in SoHo, and I was hoping that you'd go with me.
 What? Do you want to go out with me tonight? Why? Because it would be fun.
 And you seem cool.
 What? I was looking for some money in my mother's room, and I found  some naked pictures under her mattress.
 She was just sitting there in her house coat, holding one of her boobs like this.
 I knew she must have taken those pictures for her boyfriend Sonny.
 Because Sonny used to come over twice a month.
 You knew when Sonny was coming over, 'cause she would take us to the store and buy two steaks and a bottle of Nair with cocoa butter.
 How many pages do we have now? Five.
 Make the letters bigger, Toof.
 According to Wikipedia, you were discovered after doing stand-up at the Apollo in 1984.
 I have no memory of that.
 Write it up.
 Here is your salad.
 And your change.
 Oh, no.
 Dude, is this spinach? Yes,  you, uh-- You asked for a spinach salad.
 No, I like the stuff that comes on the spinach salad, but I wanted it with romaine.
 So you want me to take it back? I'm supposed to treat you like Kenneth, right? Yes.
 Well, then, yeah, genius.
 Get me a new salad.
 Or get me a time machine so I can go back in time and smack your mom for smoking crack while she's pregnant.
 Too much? No, that's usually how it goes.
 Hey, what happened? Did you ask him? Well, I was going to.
 Oh, Liz.
 But before I could, the Hair asked me out.
 What? The the Hair? What did you say? I had to say yes.
 He looked at me with those crazy handsome-guy eyes.
 It was like the Death Star tractor beam when the Falcon is-- No, Liz.
 Do not talk about stuff like that on your date.
 Guys like that do not like Star Trek.
 Wars! I'm sorry.
 You're right.
 I don't go out on dates with guys like Gray.
 It feels wrong.
 He's the Hair, and I am a Head-plus, at best.
 Or maybe you really are the Hair and I'm the Head in our relationship.
 Oh, God, no.
 Something is wrong with this.
 I have upset the natural balance of things.
 Good morning, ladies.
 I'm making a coffee run.
 Would either of you care for anything? Liz and Jenna, nothing.
 What's happening? I don't know.
 Good God, what does that man doing here? I don't know.
 I've never met Brian Williams, but his dressing room has to be cleaned up every day between 11 and 11:30.
 That way, by the time Mr.
 Williams gets back from the liquor store, it's nice and tidy.
 Kenneth, a friend of mine tipped me off about a position in our aviation division.
 It's entry level only, of course.
 Is this tube sock filled with bird seed? Yes, sir.
 Just put it in the basket with the others.
 At any rate, I'd be happy to put in a good word for you.
 What? And leave show business? No, thank you.
 Kenneth, what's your plan? Well, I like to start cleaning in one corner, and then work my way across the room in a zig-zag.
 No, no, no.
 Your life plan.
 You're learning nothing here.
 You're doing nothing here.
 You're a punching bag.
 I like this job.
 Kenneth, this is not a job.
 This is an exercise in constant humiliation.
 You're fired.
 I beg your pardon? You said I'm your boss for today.
 So I fire you.
 How ya doin'? Liz! Hi.
 This is Kiara, Francesca, that's Talbot and that's Armand.
 Hello.
 Would you like something to drink? Yes, Pinot Grigio.
 I'll be right back.
 Is  that bad? So you guys been watching Heroes? I like the Japanese dude.
 The hors d'oeuvres tonight are boxes of pure oxygen infused with a saffron and a white truffle oil.
 Wow.
 Hey, how is it going? Terrifying.
 It's too much.
 I just want to go home and watch that show about midgets and eat a block of cheddar cheese.
 If it makes you feel any better, I've discovered I'm not a Head.
 I'll talk to you later.
 Let's put the fun in funky.
 Hey! Hey, what are you doing? Sorry, that party was just a little too awesome for me.
 Do you want to go someplace else, just the two of us? Okay, what's your game, friend? Game? There's no game.
 What are you talking about? I don't have any money, if that's what you're after.
 And I'm not one of those girls that does weird stuff in bed, because they think they have to.
 If you're a gay guy looking for a beard, I don't do that anymore.
 And if you're trying to harvest my organs and sell them, I have an uncle who's a cop, so don't even try it.
 Hey, we all have uncles who are cops, so just take it down a notch.
 No hundreds.
 Small bills.
 Oh, I knew this was going to happen.
 Store policy.
 Yeah, that's an illegal policy.
 You have to take this.
 No, I don't.
 Yeah, sir.
 You do.
 See? It says right here: "Legal tender for all debts public and private.
" Does it say anything about $100 for a bottle of water? You can't decide what money you'll accept.
 That's illegal.
 It's an illegal policy.
 You're holding up the line.
 No, you're holding up the line.
 Well, I spent most of the summer in the studio doing my Christmas album, which was huge.
 I'm almost afraid to ask.
 What Christmas album? * Imagine Christmas wishes * Shooting out of your eyes * A candy cake * Full of snow dreams *  A stocking full of smiles * It's a Jordan Christmas * I remember that.
 That video was raunchy.
 Mm-hmm.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 Did you get home okay last night? Yeah.
 Thank you for convincing me to go back to the party.
 It was fun.
 Although I ate way too much oxygen.
 Yeah, you actually got a little oxygen right there on your coat.
 Thank you.
 This is going to sound pathetic, but I'm kind of trying to make myself do new things, and last night was all new for me, so that's good.
 Okay, so here's something else I bet you've never done before.
 Call in sick to work and go see a movie.
 A movie? A movie.
 With you.
 With me.
 Now.
 Right now.
 Come on.
 Good.
 Oh, Pete, it's me.
 I'm not coming in.
 I have a flu thing, and I'm-- I just barfed on 6th Avenue.
 Hi, Jack.
 I was, uh-- This is Gray.
 Nice to meet you.
 Lemon, you're looking a little under the weather.
 Maybe you should go home.
 Come on.
 Kenneth, do you have a minute? I sure don't.
 Kenneth, you and I actually have a lot in common.
 We're both hard workers.
 When I was your age, I was putting myself through college in Boston, paddling swan boats for the tourists.
 Is that a euphemism for some kind of sex worker? Kenneth, my point is, I worked hard, because I wanted to get somewhere.
 I had drive.
 And it disappoints me to see you without a dream, content with this meaningless, pitiful job.
 Do you know why I put up with this pitiful job, Mr.
 Donaghy? Why I fetch these folks' lunches and clean up their barfs? Because they make television.
 And more than jazz, or musical theater, or morbid obesity, television is the true American art form.
 Think of all the shared experiences television has provided for us.
 From the moon landing to the Golden Girls finale.
 From Walter Cronkite denouncing Vietnam to Oprah pulling that trash bag of fat out in a wagon.
 From the glory and the pageantry of the Summer Olympics to the less fun Winter Olympics.
 So please, don't tell me I don't have a dream, sir.
 I am living my dream.
 Oh, my.
 How did he get that up there? I wish I shared your passion for television, Kenneth.
 Which show would you rather watch? An ex-porn star who talks to ghosts, or a remake of Little House on the Prairie? Neither.
 I want to see a show where women get their hair done, while listening to salsa music.
 I also have an idea for a cop show.
 Called K-9, exclamation point.
 Oh, and a game show called Gold Case.
 It's a cross between Deal or No Deal and Millionaire, with a charming celebrity host to be determined.
 Go on.
 It's called Gold Case.
 It's Deal or No Deal meets Millionaire.
 There are ten models, each holding an identical briefcase, but one of them is filled with gold.
 Have you pitched this idea to anybody else? Well, I talked to Moonvest over at CBS.
 Les Moonves, president of CBS, knows about this? Hey, Moonvest, I got an idea for a game show last night.
 Give me your fingernails! No! We've got to move fast.
 Mr.
 Parcell, we love Gold Case.
 How do we make your show? I thought y'all would know where to get cameras and stuff.
 I think he means, "How much do you want for it?" Oh.
 As far as compensation goes, I would like to be officially the head of the pages, and I need a new clock radio.
 You've got it up there, now snap it off.
 Also I want five points on the back end, and a creator credit on this and any international editions.
 And a clock radio.
 We're a go.
 Congratulations.
 Thank you.
 Woke up in the camper at the auto show, and that's how 2006 ended.
 I can't believe this.
 We're actually going to pull this off.
 It was early January 2007 when I got the idea to write my autobiography.
 So I took a meeting at Random House, and I went in and talked to this editor about it, and this dude looked me straight in the eyes and said, "No, Mr.
 Jordan.
 No, thank you.
 We do not want your book.
" Oops, my bad.
 That's on me.
 Shut it down.
 No way.
 Your elevator opens right into your apartment? Are you coming in? I don't know.
 This is new for me.
 I don't really hang out with superfluously handsome gentlemen in kick-ass elevator lofts.
 What else don't you do? I don't smoke.
 I don't use any drugs, except for my allergy medicine.
 I don't download music without paying for it.
 And I never wear flip-flops.
 Ever.
 It's gross.
 Real? It's real.
 I do not sit on laps.
 Really? No, not a lap-sitter.
 Never have been.
 Nice to see you again.
 I thought you were trying new things.
 Okay.
 It's just-- It's a small girl thing, it's not a grown lady thing.
 Okay.
 All right, there you go.
 Okay? Mm-hmm.
 See? It's not so bad.
 No, it's not bad.
 I  can't-- I keep waiting for something to go wrong.
 Liz, I am not gay, I am not married, I don't have a human head in my freezer.
 Yeah, but you're the Hair.
 And so are you.
 Okay, we're going to do this, then.
 Mm-hmm.
 Why do you have a picture of my great-aunt Dolly? Uh, no, that's my grandmother's cousin Dolly.
 Dolly Harlan.
 No, I said Dolly  Harlan.
 From Smithtown.
 Oh, my God.
 We're related.
 Oh, no.
 Oh, God.
 Wow.
 This is the worst! Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were fifth cousins.
 Okay, on the count of three, say what level of cousins we would have to be for this to be okay.
 One, two, three.
 Fifth.
 Unacceptable, no matter what.
 This is never going to work.
 Of course it's not.
 It never was.
 This is what I get for trying to be somebody I am not.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
 Look, look.
 I meant what I said earlier.
 You are a Hair, Liz Lemon.
 It's in our blood.
 Accept it.
 Embrace it.
 I think we're third cousins.
 Yeah, I'll see you at the reunion.
 Kind of wish you had a door right now.
 All right, Jeff.
 One of these briefcases is filled with a million dollars' worth of solid gold.
 Are you ready? Let's play Gold Case! That one.
 Congratulations.
 You struck gold on Gold Case.
 Uh-oh.
 What? That one.
 That one.
 That one.
 Congratulations.
 You struck gold on Gold Case.
 Oh, gold's real heavy, isn't it? This game doesn't work.
 Okay, my bad.
 Shut it down.
 Shut it down! That's it! At least you got a clock radio out of it, right? Whose idea was this? This is pathetic.
 A joke.
 This whole show is a joke.
   

                




                    			Subs By Traff and raceman Okay, Round 2.
 Josh, you're up.
 What do you got? Check it out.
 Your mama is so stupid, she thinks an iMac is a new hamburger at McDonald's.
 Okay, not bad.
 Okay, okay, I got one.
 I got one.
 What's the difference between your mama and a washing machine? When I drop a load in the washing machine it doesn't follow me around for a week.
 Lemon, could I speak with you alone for a moment? That's what your sister asked me last night.
 Booyah! Uh, right this way.
 Uh, my friend Gerhard Hapsburg is throwing a birthday party for himself at the Pierre tonight.
 Oh, and you want me to think of something funny that you can write in the card? No.
 I want you to come with me.
 Oh.
 Who's Gerhard Hapsburg? Prince Gerhard is the last male descendant of the Imperial House of Hapsburg.
 They ruled the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
 The Defenestration of Prague? Lemon, what exactly did you study in college? Theatre Tech.
 I see.
 I'm inviting you to the social event of the season.
 OhI don't know, Jack.
 Would I have to wear high heel shoes? Yes.
 This will be good for you.
 You finally got Dennis out of your life.
 You're even wearing lipstick.
 No.
 They're just really chapped.
 I'll have the wardrobe department pull a dress for you.
 I just thought maybe you'd like to spend some time with a, um different class of people.
 Okay, fine.
 I'll do it.
 But I'm not gonna like it.
 That's what your mom said to me last night.
 Booyah.
 You got slammed, girl.
 That was surprising.
 Yes, dear.
 Oh, boy, who's crying? Is that Caleb? What's up, Pete? Okay, I'll try.
 Yeah.
 Elmo wants you to aim your pee-pee at the potty! Ha ha! No, not at Mommy.
 At the potty.
 How is that Elmo's fault? Did Mommy have some wine before she called Elmo? Click.
 Enhhhh! Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete.
 Where's your spinal cord, son? What? No, it's just my wife is visiting her folks and she's a little stressed out.
 Yeah, seem like you got yourself a Delilah.
 A what? Pete, you got two type of women in this world: one who gives you strength and one who takes strength from you like Delilah took strength from Samson in that movie? My wife gives me strength, make me feel like a man.
 That's why she's so special.
 I actually haven't met your wife yet.
 Hi.
 That ain't my wife.
 Go get me a fizzy water.
 It's like this, Pete.
 I love my wife.
 I love her.
 We're a team.
 That's why eight times a week I go to the strip club.
 It gives me energy, which I bring back to her.
 And your wife doesn't get jealous? Nah.
 She likes it.
 Makes me feel strong, like a Samson.
 Here.
 Samson! What? Great shoving, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Wow, what's that for? Well, I'm going to a birthday party for some prince tonight.
 You mean like a dog birthday party? Oh, that's better.
 No.
 He's a real European prince: Gerhard Hapsburg.
 What? You have to take me with you.
 Oh, Liz, it's always been my dream to meet and marry a prince, like a modern day Cinderella story.
 Hey, maybe I'm Cinderella this time.
 No, Liz, Cinderella is blonde.
 You can be Snow White and party with the little people.
 Oh, take me.
 I can't take you.
 I'm only getting in because Donaghy's taking me.
 Wait.
 You're gonna be Jack Donaghy's date? No.
 It's not a date.
 Wow.
 Lemon.
 I, uh, got you a little something.
 Oh, my--Ow! That really hurt my hand.
 Dag! Who does that?! I'm sorry.
 Our car will be downstairs at 7:00.
 Could you make sure that she, uh, gets this? Oh, yes.
 Sorry.
 This is definitely a date.
 No.
 Is it? I didn't know I was coming to this tonight.
 Don't apologize.
 You look great.
 May I? Uh, I got it.
 Thanks.
 Careful.
 Careful.
 Thank you so much.
 Let's see, um to us.
 Is this a date? What? [chuckles] Lemon I date socialites and models and actresses-- Liz Hurley in the '90s.
 Fine.
 My mistake.
 I think 's so funny that you thought that.
 Hi, Jack.
 Maybe I'll see you later.
 I hope so.
 Her.
 Her.
 Her.
 The two of them.
 This guy coming up on my left-- his daughter this summer.
 Wes, good to see you.
 Pete Hornberger, tonight is the night we celebrate our bodies and our minds.
 Hit it! Oh, hello.
 Hi.
 How did you get in here? Oh, Liz, if you dress well and enter with confidence, you can get in anywhere.
 You showed the security guy your boobs, didn't you? Just one.
 It's not the White House.
 Um, Chocatini, please? You were dead wrong about this being a date, by the way.
 I just made a complete ass out of myself in front of Jack.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 When I'm the Queen of Australia, I'll have him executed.
 Austria.
 Yeah, that's what I said.
 Ladies und gentlemen, may I present His Royal Highness, zeh Duke of Thuringia, Earl of the Duchy of Westphalia, Prince Gerhard Messerschmidt Ramstein Von Hap.
 Thank you.
 Thank you, all dear friends for coming to my birthday! Wow, who's Snow White now? That Gerhard is amazing, isn't he? Ah-hum.
 Most people in his situation would be angry with their family for the centuries of inbreeding, but not Gerhar.
 He's too busy trying to stave off infection.
 Oh, my God.
 What is she doing here? Who? My ex-wife.
 Oh, I forgot, you were married.
 Wow, she's gorgeous.
 And surprisingly age-appropriate.
 Damn it.
 I was told she was in Paris.
 The party of the year, that woman turns up, and I'm all alone.
 Thanks.
 Johnny.
 Bianca.
 Ah, it's been a while.
 You look good.
 Thank you.
 Do you remember my fiancé Vincent Foley? Yes, of course.
 This is my live-in girlfriend Lemon.
 Elizabeth.
 Elizabeth.
 Hello, Elizabeth.
 Lemon.
 Nice to meet you.
 And how did you two meet? It was part of the Big Brother/ Little Sister Program.
 Congratulations, John.
 She's much sharper than the last girl you had.
 What was her name? Beyoncé.
 And unlike the rest of Jack's girlfriends, I have all my original parts.
 Oh, hang on to this one, John.
 She's a keeper.
 Mmm, yeah.
 I'm a keeper.
 So now it's a date? I thought I could never be your date, Jack.
 I thought no one would ever believe it because I'm so grotesque.
 Thank you for not embarrassing me.
 Excuse me, Miss, but His Highness has noticed you.
 Who, Gerhard? Really? His Highness is quite taken und invites you to dine next to him.
 Oh, wow.
 That's flattering.
 Are you sure that me meant me? His Highness is attempting to wink at you.
 Oh.
 Heh.
 There you are.
 I need your help.
 I've been asked to dine with His Majesty.
 Oh, well, if you're looking to sneak out the window, it doesn't open.
 I already tried it.
 Should I say I'm still a virgin? Wait.
 You're actually considering this? Of course I'm considering it.
 You know I've always reminded myself of Grace Kelly.
 I'm not gonna be gorgeous forever.
 Who knows how long this show will last, and I have no other skills whatsoever.
 I need to find someone who can take care of me.
 Yeah.
 I don't think Gerhard can take care of you.
 And I can get past someone's looks.
 Since when? I'm an actress, Liz.
 It would be my greatest role of all time.
 You've already made up your mind about this, haven't you? Oh, you're right, Liz, I should go for it.
 You're not even listening, are you? Poop.
 Monkey Butt.
 No.
 You're a good friend.
 And thank you.
 You enjoying yourself, Pete? Actually-- Actually, Tracy, I'm trying to get some work done here.
 Hey, Supersize, take care of that dude.
 That there's my friend.
 Saved my life when we was in Desert Storm.
 Our tank broke down.
 He killed 14 Germans so we could get the hell outta there.
 No.
 No, actually, I'm just a producer on Tracy's show.
 You're a producer? Yeah.
 I'm an actress.
 Oh, yeah? Have you ever seen the movie Secret Touchings? I was a scientist in that.
 No, I'm not familiar with that.
 Your name sounds Jewish.
 You must be important.
 No.
 Well, I just, you know, I run the show.
 Mr.
 Hornberger.
 This is shocking.
 Mind your business, son! He's embracing his power.
 Rawwrr.
 Rawwrr.
 Rawwrr.
 Hey, are you gonna come sit down? Because they put out lobster tails, and I want to eat yours.
 Isn't she beautiful? Yeah.
 What happened there? I just couldn't keep up with her.
 On any level.
 Socially, it was a different party, a different charity event every night.
 I had to keep my tuxedo in my glove compartment.
 Sexually-- she wanted it four or five times a day.
 And always standing up.
 Standing up, what? How does that even work? You're kidding, right? Yeah.
 She left me, Lemon, 'cause I was never enough for her.
 So now I keep it simple: nothing but endless, meaningless one-night stands with a carousel of super hot women I couldn't care less about.
 That's heartbreaking.
 And her? She just keeps getting better.
 She's lost weight.
 She cut her hair.
 Look at her over there, taunting me.
 Seeing her so happy and normal makes me crazy.
 You've got to move on, maybe.
 Is she coming over here? She's coming over here.
 If she comes over here, I'm gonna do something.
 Okay, come on.
 Let's go.
 Let's go dance.
 Oh, no, no, no.
 No.
 Yeah, come on.
 It's a fast song.
 Okay, easy there, Jackie Chan.
 Are they in? They're not out? Yeah, be careful.
 Oh.
 Hee hee.
 That tickles.
 Oh, my dear Jenna you are exquisite! Uh, Gerhard would you like to dance? Sadly, because my body does not produce joint fluid, I cannot.
 But I would enjoy watching you dance for me.
 Oh all right.
 Jazz! Tap! Jitterbug! Charleston! Ooh.
 Interpretive! Twirl! Twirl again! Keep twirling! Everyone thinks I'm 5'5", but I'm only 5'4".
 Wow! That is an amazing story.
 Yeah.
 What are you doing? You are a married man.
 I'm not doing anything wrong.
 Just--I'm just dancing, Kenneth.
 Do you remember the movie, Footloose, where those evil kids won in the end? You're going to make a mistake tonight.
 You gonna make a mistake tonight! Remember the vows you and your wife took in that church.
 Botanical garden.
 Botanical garden.
 You promised fidelity-- Lick her face.
 Think of God.
 Look, both of you calm down.
 I'm just trying to have some fun for the first time in, like, ten years.
 Ladies und gentlemen, if you will please direct your attention to zeh center of zeh room, it is now time for zeh cake.
 (attendees) Aw.
 You're 25? Yes.
 Can you believe it? Finally old enough to rent a car.
 Ahck! Ahck! Oh, it feels good to laugh.
 Oh, boy! * Happy birthd-- * Zum geburstag viel gluck * * Zum geburstag viel gluck * * Zum getburstag viel * * Gerhard * Gerhard * Zum geburstag viel gluck * Go on.
 Pbbbbbt! Pbbbbbt! Sie sprechen Deutsch? Yes.
 Yay.
 Is that Jenna mit Gerhard? Bianca.
 Happy birthday.
 Thank you.
 Vicky.
 No.
 This is the men's room.
 I know.
 I just wanted to talk to you.
 Oh, no, no.
 You don't need to do that.
 We should get back to the party, right? I mean, shouldn't we? Mr.
 Hornberger.
 I mean, right? The party? Mr.
 Hornberger! Never done it in a men's bathroom before.
 Well, in this building.
 Wow.
 You're Smooth.
 Mr.
 Hornberger! Kenneth? You're making the biggest mistake of your life.
 Don't do it.
 Oh, I suppose you're gonna tell me I should do it.
 No.
 I'm just lookin' for the lobby.
 But, yes, you should do it.
 (Ken) No, you shouldn't.
 Please think of your children.
 Be a Samson! You're a better man than this.
 She's so smooth.
 I'm sorry.
 I can't do this.
 I love my wife.
 My wife is not a Delilah, Tracy.
 Hey, that's beautiful.
 I feel you, Hornberger.
 Who's that tickling my feet? I'm gonna kick you in your face, I know that.
 Just water, please.
 Are you going to marry him? Oh, hi.
 What? Are you going to marry Jack? UhI don't know.
 We've talked about it.
 I can tell from the way he looks at you that he's serious.
 That's going to get you pregnant right away, I'm sure.
 A little late-in-life baby he can parade around Nantucket.
 The whole thing makes me want to vomit.
 Oh, no.
 You know what-- I can take the models-- the Rockettes to Shakira-- because ultimately I know they are going to leave him, but you? You can actually make him happy.
 And that makes me want to sit on a knife! Wow.
 I hate seeing Johnny happy! Uh Oh, boy.
 Oh, Jenna, this is almost like something out of a fairy tale.
 [chuckles] Yes.
 Almost.
 Great news.
 Great news.
 Bianca is neither normal nor happy.
 You don't have to do this, Lemon.
 I'm telling you, she's not over you.
 And get this: she was all jealous of me.
 She busted out crying over it.
 That's impossible.
 Ohfine.
 You don't believe me? I'm gonna go over there, I'm gonna tell her that you just proposed to me, and you watch her.
 Watch how red her face gets, okay? Bianca, I have to tell you, Jack and I are engaged.
 Ah! Aah! Let go.
 Aah! You! What do you know? Jenna I know we have just met, but I think I love you.
 Do you love me? [muffled] Mm-hmm.
 Oh! Knowing I have the love of a beautiful woman has set me free.
 I think you just lost an eyebrow.
 To freedom.
 To us.
 Thank you, dear Jenna.
 And good-bye.
 Good-bye? W-why good-bye? Who let him drink champagne? He cannot metabolize zeh grapes.
 Someone call Dr.
 Spuchemen! Uh-oh.
 I think she pulled out a chunk of my hair.
 Really? Where? Oh, yeah.
 We gotta boogie, gang.
 Meine damen und herren, zeh Hapsburg line has ended.
 You can pick up your gift bags at zeh coat check.
 Hey, Pete, really inspiring what you did back there.
 You're strong now.
 When your wife get home, you gonna mess it up? Actually, I think I might.
 Let's go.
 You goin' down, Pete? Uh I'll take the stairs.
 Hold the door, please.
 Mmm! You look like a baby.
 Well, thanks for a fun evening.
 Sorry your friend died.
 When Gerhard was born, the doctor told his mother and cousin he would either live for 15 minutes or for 100 years.
 Boy, he proved them all wrong.
 No, please, come in.
 The look on Bianca's face just before she choked you.
 That was the most satisfying thing.
 It was pretty good.
 Oh, just to know that she's filled with bile over me warms my heart.
 Attaboy.
 That's the Jack Donaghy I know.
 What are these, your bike shorts? All right, knock it off.
 Lemon, I want to thank you for showing me that I can have a pleasant evening with a woman my own age.
 I'm 12 years younger than you.
 A woman your age, then.
 Jack, wait.
 Oh, my God.
 I thought you were-- Oh, good lord, Lemon, let it go.
 That's never going to happen.
 I've been with beauty queens-- Yes, I get it.
 Pilates instructors, acrobats.
 Get outta here so I can take my shoes off.
 Come on.
 I had "lunch" with Martha Stewart and "dinner" with her daughter Alexis.
 Gross.
   

                




                    			No, Jack, I'm not blaming you but everybody got food poisoning.
 Food poisoning? That isn't possible.
 That seafood was a gift from my friend, the owner of the Cleveland Browns.
 They're very expensive freshwater clams from the Cuyahoga River.
 My whole staff has been blorching for three days, so if there's any way that we could show a rerun-- I wish I could help you, Lemon, but I've already sold the ad time to the army.
 Now, do the best you can, I need a live show from you in two days.
 Uh, no, no, no, no.
 That's not for you.
 Bianca's coming.
 Crazy Bianca is coming here? You make me wanna vomit.
 Why? Because she wants something.
 She only contacts me when she wants something, and she's bringing her lawyer.
 Which means she's gonna try to bleed something else out of me in our divorce proceedings.
 You're not all the way divorced? Well, we've been legally separated since 1989.
 It's been a nightmare, Lemon.
 I mean, one minute you're newlyweds making love on the floor of the Concorde, and the next your lawyers are fighting over who gets to keep the box your dog defecates in.
 You taught your dog to poop in a box? Bianca did, but I want that box.
 Ugh.
 It's gonna take all day and into the night to deal with that crazy woman.
 Fighting, conniving, clawing at each other.
 Are you angry or excited right now? I can't tell.
 Mrs.
 Donaghy and her lawyer are here.
 I'm sorry, Johnny.
 I'm a little early.
 This would work on Ugly Betty.
 Hey, guys.
 I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to work all night tonight till we get caught up.
 What? Liz I can't believe you're gonna make us work all night on Valentine's Day.
 Is it Valentine's Day? Oh, I totally forgot.
 Hells, yes, Liz Lemon.
 And I had plans.
 Me and Angie rented the penthouse at the SoHo Grand where we will drink wine and pleasure each other.
 Gross.
 When you been married 17 years, you have to keep it spicy.
 That's why me and my wife role-play.
 She put on a Girl Scout outfit with a box of cookies, and I answer the door in my boxers.
 Or I rent out a wheelchair, and she pretends to be my caseworker.
 And in a way, she is.
 Well, what about me? I just took a whole bunch of Cialis 'cause I have big Valentine's plans tonight.
 With who? Uh, nobody.
 Okay, you know, I'm sorry, you guys, but we have to get this done.
 Let's order some dinner.
 Cerie, do you mind working late on Valentine's Day? No, I don't care.
 Aris and I are in a huge fight anyway.
 Well--Aris? Is that your fiancé, Aris? Yeah, he keeps sending me all these flowers to apologize, but he's still insisting on having a Greek Orthodox wedding, but I really disagree with the church's stance on Cyprus.
 Mm, so, um, Chinese? Or not? Liz, these are actually for you.
 Who are they from? I don't know, it doesn't say.
 Secret admirer! Too bad you gotta work all night! Johnny, thank you for speaking to me in person.
 If this is about the dog box, I'm not giving in.
 Oh, no, Johnny.
 I feel so terrible for what happened at Gerhardt's party.
 Really? I had a fabulous time at that party.
 I want our divorce to be final.
 All right.
 I want back all the jewelry I ever bought you.
 Fine.
 I want the art supplies that I gave you on your 40th birthday and any subsequent art projects you made with them.
 Fine.
 I want all of our love letters.
 Fine.
 I want all of your parents' love letters.
 Fine.
 I want full stake in the Arby's franchise we bought outside of Telluride.
 Oh, damn it, Johnny, you know I love my big beef and cheddar.
 Take it all.
 Take the Arby's, take the house in Amagansett, take the Otto Dix paintings.
 I don't care anymore.
 I wanna move on.
 Mrs.
 Donaghy intends to relinquish all communal property.
 We should have the papers for you to sign tomorrow.
 Then I suppose we're done.
 We're done.
 Break out a bottle of champagne, but not the one that came with the shellfish.
 Get some other bottle of champagne.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Did you send me these to be nice? Why would I send you flowers? Because it's Valentine's Day-- Oh, no! It's what? It's Valentine's Day? Again? Oh, did you blow it with your wife? It's too late, it's too late, I blew it.
 Well, who cares, you know, it's just Valentine's Day.
 It's also her birthday.
 Ah.
 Oh, I got the turkey club.
 Hey.
 Hey, what's up? Did you just come from a Suzanne Somers look-alike contest? Hilarious, Frank.
 Actually, I just came from performing at Vagina Day.
 Is that an off-shoot of The Vagina Monologues? No, we are in no way affiliated with The Vagina Monologues.
 Vagina Day is a charity event founded by a group of celebrities who have, for whatever reason, never been asked to participate in The Vagina Monologues.
 Every February 14, we improvise monologues about our lady parts for the homeless.
 Oh, to benefit the homeless? No, just for them.
 My vagina is a flower.
 A weird ugly flower.
 I remember the night I lost my virginity.
 It was 1968, during the Democratic Convention.
 Lemon, it's done.
 What's done? My divorce, it's final.
 [laughter] Mwah! I'm divorced, everyone! Who wants to grab a drink? Yeah, I really can't, Jack.
 You're making us work all night, remember? Oh.
 Hey, did you send me these because you feel bad? I did not and I do not.
 Hey, Pete, you up for a quick cocktail? Sorry, I gotta duck out, I just found a Hallmark store open 70 blocks from here! Oh, Tracy, what do you say? A quick drink to celebrate my freedom? Aw, Jackie D.
, any other time, but I made plans with my wife tonight.
 Just one quick one.
 This is the best night of my life! All right-- just one! I gotta be downtown dressed as a ninja by 10:00.
 Let's go.
 Hey, Frank, marry, boff, kill.
 Beyoncé, Paula Abdul, and Oprah.
 Dude, that's beyond easy.
 Boff Beyoncé, kill Paula, marry Oprah.
 Okay, marry, boff, kill.
 Cerie, Liz, and Jenna.
 Once again, no-brainer.
 Marry Liz, get with Cerie, kill Jenna.
 I can hear you! (Liz) Frank, knock it off.
 Don't play that game about people who are in the room.
 Why not? Because it always starts out fun and then it gets weird.
 But thank you for saying that you would marry me.
 You didn't send me these, right? No.
 Are you kidding me? Hi, um, my name is Liz Lemon, and I received flowers from your shop tonight.
 And I can't tell who they're from.
 No, no, I did read the card, but it's not signed.
 No, I'm not with so many men that it's impossible for me to guess.
 Well, that is just-- oh, oh, well, you know what? I found the card, actually, they're from your mom.
 Yeah, so tell your gay mom I said thanks.
 We gotta order some more champagne, go and jump on my helicopter, and buzz Trump Tower until Don comes out on the roof and begs us to stop.
 Yeah, sounds good! I just gotta call my wife, let her know I'm gonna be late.
 Hey, Angie, listen, I'm gonna be-- Right.
 I have to go.
 No, no, no, no, no, no.
 That is the weak married man inside you talking.
 I used to be like you.
 Always remember, marriage is a competition, and after 18 years of overtime, I am finally going to claim victory! You live it up, J.
D.
 You know where to find me if you need me.
 Okay, I got a hard one.
 Osama bin Laden, Martha Stewart, Jenna.
 Bone Osama bin Laden, it'd shame him, and then his own people would murder him.
 Marry Martha Stewart 'cause, you know, she seems like a dirty bird.
 And kill Jenna.
 Cerie, marry, boff, kill.
 Lutz, Toofer, or Kenneth.
 I'd marry Toofer 'cause he's classy.
 I'd kill Lutz.
 Sorry, Lutz.
 The thought that you would do anything to me is awesome.
 And I'd boff Kenneth.
 What? Really? Okay, what's your problem with me? What? You're always making rudeomments.
 You never wanna work with me.
 Why don't you like me? 'Cause you're a big phony.
 What? Everything about you is fake.
 Your tan's fake, your hair's fake.
 Not the front! You've never done or said anything real or genuine the whole time I've known you.
 Oh, really? And does a phony bare her soul for the homeless? Because that comes from in here.
 My vagina is a convenience store.
 Clean and reliable.
 And closed on Christmas.
 Fakeand weird.
 Now I would like to propose a toast to my ex-wife who tomorrow I'm going to be saying good-bye to for the very last time.
 (women) Aww.
 No, no.
 No, no, no.
 She is very, very mentally sick.
 I mean, if you met her, you might think she's wonderful, but believe me, she is the succubus from the bowels of hell.
 I mean, if I were forced to remember her as I first met her, when I first fell in love with her, then, yes, I-I, you know, suppose empirically she is very, very beautiful, but, uh But it's what's inside her that really makes her disgusting.
 I wish I could touch her boobs again.
 She really had a fabulous pair of boobs.
 Ah.
 I admit Sometimes I would fantasize about her getting various terminal illnesses, and I would nurse her.
 To her death.
 And she would say, "Johnny, I'm in so much pain!" And I would say, "Just hang in there a little longer, Bianca.
" Love.
 They say that lightning never strikes twice.
 But I know that I will love again.
 And I'm never gonna be happy until I find that woman.
 I think what I'm saying to you is what are you doing tonight? Shh.
 [whispering] Kenneth.
 This is your chance.
 Cerie digs you.
 Excuse me? And she's upset with her fiancé.
 Cerie said she would do it with you.
 Well, that just makes me perspire.
 In fact, I think we need you and Cerie to go on a candy run.
 Okay.
 [quietly] But I need to-- (Lutz) She can't go by herself.
 It's 1:00 in the morning.
 Can I help you? Yes, sir.
 We have reports of a nitrogen leak on this floor.
 Oh, no, our room is fine.
 I mean, we don't smell it.
 Oh, it's odorless, sir.
 I really need to check this room.
 Well, could you hurry up? Because my wife and I are planning a really special night tonight.
 Oh, it's for your own safety, sir.
 Mm.
 I'm detecting a lot of heat over here.
 Is it dangerous? I don't know.
 I think it's coming from my butt.
 Oh, no, I'm married! That's how I like 'em.
 Ah! What? Oh! Role-play, baby! Give it to me, baby! Oh, oh, yeah.
 Okay.
 I don't know who that is, but we done 'cause I'm not velcro-ing up again.
 Just be cool.
 Just bebe cool.
 Hold on tight.
 Who is it? Oh, Tracy.
 We couldn't find a hotel room anywhere.
 The whole city is booked.
 We were hoping we could come here and party with you.
 [heavily accented] Happy Valentimes! Baby, I'm sorry.
 But he's going through some stuff.
 Angie, do you like champagne? No, it gives me a headache.
 This is a Krug Clos de Mesnil.
 I was saving it for a special occasion.
 And I thought to myself, my God, this is it, am I right? Good news, good friends.
 I clean this too, or, uh, just the sex? Isn't she precious? Hey, fun fact about Vlem, she originally came here to study engineering.
 Come on, doll.
 You tell GE light bulb man I want Sophie's Choice out of my suite! Babe! Lemon! Are you coming? Let's stall for a minute.
 It's so boring up there anyway.
 You know, Aris is just so immature sometimes.
 That's why I like you, Kenneth.
 You're an old soul.
 Thank you.
 My momma thinks so too.
 In fact, she's pretty sure I'm the reincarnated soul of Adren Twyford.
 He was our town minister who died in an organ fire.
 [beeping] Ugh.
 He keeps texting me to meet him downtown at his club, even though he knows I'm working.
 Well, it's like Dr.
 Laura Schlessinger says, "Women should be more accommodating to their men for the health of the marriage.
" She sounds smart.
 Is she really a doctor? No, I think she's kinda like Dr.
 Pepper.
 Well.
 I'm gonna go meet him downtown then.
 Thanks, Kenneth.
 You give really good advice.
 Kenneth.
 What? How dare you? You're so weird.
 Tell Liz I left, okay? All right.
 Oh, and if you wanna tell those guys upstairs that we made out, it's all right with me.
 Ooh, video games.
 We could play video games.
 This is the second-worst Valentine's Day we ever had.
 Hi, is Mr.
 Donaghy here? Another prostitute? Lemon, what do you say? You and me, Atlantic City.
 We can be in the crepe line at The Borgata by dawn.
 No, Jack.
 What are you doing? I'm celebrating.
 I want Bianca to see that I'm moving on.
 Well then maybe you should call Bianca to help you carry your prostitute out of the hotel you were just ejected from.
 You think I should? She'd probably come right down here.
 You two are sick! This relationship is sick! You just don't understand, it's complicated! No, I don't understand! Let me ask you a question.
 Marry, boff, kill.
 Bianca.
 Which do you wanna do? All of them.
 All of them.
 You've gotta get out of each other's lives, Jack, or you wilnever be happy.
 Between the two of you, you are 100 years old, and this is not a dignified way for a 100-year-old couple to behave.
 I know.
 I know.
 Uh, oh, leave her there.
 It's nicer than where I found her.
 Come on.
 Happy Valentimes! You know what, friend? You got a loof nerve, calling me a fake.
 You wear your thrift store T-shirts and your big weird glasses, and everybody says, "Oh, look at Frank, he's so cool.
 He has a hat that says Extra Cheese.
" What does that even mean? It's pretty self-explanatory.
 Admit it, you spend just as much time and energy trying to look weird as I do trying to look beautiful.
 And you can act like you hate me, but if I tried to kiss you right now, you would totally do it.
 'Cause you're a big phony jerk! And I just wanted to tell you that.
 Okay, fine! I pooted.
 It's 3:00 in the morning.
 Are you happy? Yeah, I'm happy, because that's the first time you've ever done something like a real person.
 It's pretty cool.
 I-I could do it again, but I wouldn't wanna show off.
 Jenna.
 I'm sorry I said I would kill you.
 Thank you.
 Snacks! What happened? So? Tell us? None of your beeswax.
 He blew it.
 Way to go, loser.
 Oh, yeah? If I blew it, then how did I get her underpants? Just this last one, and then your marriage is officially dissolved.
 It's almost like it never happened.
 I wouldn't be surprised if that five-inch scar across my abdomen was suddenly gone.
 Johnny.
 Promise me you won't sell the Arby's.
 No, I won't.
 I'm gonna shut it down.
 Leave it vacant.
 Open the windows and let nature have at it.
 This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
 That's prime property on Highway 145.
 Yes, there's not a thing you can do about it.
 But it is irresponsible to the community.
 They should sue you.
 I hope they do.
 Oh, I'll see to it.
 I'll go right to the Telluride Chamber of Commerce.
 Do it.
 The case could be in court for months.
 Maybe years.
 Damn it, Johnny! Whoops.
 Hello.
 I'm sorry.
 Can I help you? Hey, that's cool? Is that a French Planet of the Apes poster? Yeah.
 Wow.
 You know, I've heard that in Greece they have to change Charlton Heston's name on movie posters to Charlton Easton.
 Because in Greek the word "Heston" means to poop yourself.
 I'm sorry, do I know you? No, I don't think so.
 Uh, you're Liz Lemon, right? Yeah.
 Okay.
 Uh, this is super awkward, but did you get two dozen pink roses last night? Yep, there they are.
 Those are from you? Yes.
 Uh, I work up in legal, and-- You're a lawyer? I prefer law stylist.
 Uh, anyway, I meant to send these to my girlfriend, Liz Lemler, who works in accounting.
 [softly] Oh.
 Yeah.
 There's actually supposed to be a box of chocolate-covered cherries with this, did you-- I don't know anything about that.
 Fair enough.
 She pouted all night because she thought I forgot to send her something.
 I told her I did, but she didn't believe me.
 She sounds great.
 Yeah, she is.
 Wellgood for you.
 Here you go.
 Sorry about the mix up.
 N-no, no! They were delivered to you, they're yours now.
 Thank you.
 You're welcome.
 But could I possibly get a photo? Of you with the flowers? Like with your ID? Oh, okay.
 Is that all right? You know, just as proof.
 All right.
 There we go.
 Aw, that's a cute one.
 Thanks.
 Sorry to bother you.
 Happy Valentine's Day.
 Happy Valentimes!   

                




                    			Come on in, Tracy.
 Yo, is this about that little red-headed intern? 'Cause she asked me to take it out.
 No, no, no.
 I wanted to invite you to join me at a charity golf tourney that Don Geiss is hosting at his country club in Old Saybrook.
 I'm not familiar with about half the words in that sentence.
 How 'bout you come with me to a big party in Connecticut, and meet Don Geiss? Is that the gay guy from Project Runway? No.
 He's the CEO of this corporation.
 The big man.
 The dude from my checks? The dude from your checks.
 And a good person for you to know.
 A'ight, sure.
 Thanks for inviting me.
 Okay false alarm.
 It turns out she asked him to take it out.
 Oh, hey.
 I'll see you in CT, Jackie D.
 What's that about? I've invited him to join me at a GE charity golf tournament in Connecticut.
 Was Courtney Love not available? Liz, all the VPs will be angling to golf with Don Geiss, but my partner will be Tracy Jordan, his grandchildren's favorite movie star.
 Geiss will absolutely choose us, and that's a big deal because being in a foursome with this man can change your life.
 You might want to rephrase that.
 Golf with Geiss means four hours of face time with a man you normally only get 20 minutes with.
 Which one is Geiss again, the bald one? No.
 That one.
 Where did that come from? I painted it myself.
 Wow, that's really good.
 You want one? Consider it done.
 Thanks.
 Simply the best Has anybody seen Condoleeza on Meet the Press yesterday? She always sounds so terrified.
 She's always, like, The President has a plan for Iran, and we are currently adhering to that plan.
 Hey, Frank, wake up.
 You're not allowed to sleep through the topical meeting.
 Dude, I'm exhausted.
 I stayed up all night watching a Designing Women marathon.
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, yeah, me too.
 At first, I hated it.
 And then I liked it.
 And then I hated it again.
 And then I got horny, and then I fell asleep.
 Well, focus up, we have a lot of work to do.
 Lutz, not while we're working! Ay, pero ay Dios mio! Oh, I'm sorry Theresa.
 I'm sorry.
 Okay, maybe something about the mid-term elections? Hey, what about my Dancing with the Hobo sketch? I didn't like it two weeks ago when it was called America's Next Top Hobo, and I didn't like it a month ago, when it was called Hobo Eye for the Straight Guy.
 Deal or No Hobo? Hey, Lutz, why don't you approach your job with the same creativity and excitement you have for all-you-can-eat buffets? Ooh.
 Ooh.
 Okay, the van to take you up to Connecticut will be leaving at noon.
 And once you get up to the golf course, you'll be working in pairs.
 So, Tim and Shyla, Amy and Becca, Kenneth and Grace, and Eric and Pat.
 Okay, have fun.
 Don't get drunk.
 Buddy up.
 Mr.
 Hornberger.
 Yeah? Grace and I cannot work together.
 Why not? We have a past.
 A romantic past.
 Well, Grace, it's been a pleasure talking to you.
 Grace Park! You know this can't happen.
 We're pages.
 I just don't want to disgrace the peacock.
 Oh, Kenneth, if you're worried about disgracing the National Broadcasting Company, you're too late.
 Look, Grace, this is obviously incredibly awkward for both of us, but let's just try to be professional.
 Your peacock earrings look nice.
 Doggone it, Grace, I just don't know myself around you.
 Hello, gentlemen.
 Welcome to the ninth annual Cure Diabetes Now golf tournament.
 Has Don Geiss arrived yet? No, sir, but if you'd like, we could work out a signal, so I could let you know when he does arrive.
 Like-- That won't be necessary.
 I'll probably just do it anyway.
 That cold open you guys wrote last night came out really good.
 Oh, thanks.
 It was like pulling teeth.
 They're so lazy sometimes.
 Especially Lutz.
 Well, good job whipping 'em into shape.
 That thing is really smart.
 Now, when Dennis Hastert farts, should that be live, or pre-recorded? Live.
 It has to be live for the timing.
 I thought so too.
 Look at these guys.
 Yeah.
 They like you.
 They're very good at sensing debilitating loneliness in a person.
 Maybe you ought to adopt one.
 Oh, I can't.
 I'm allergic to anything warm and adorable.
 I'm sick of it.
 I'm doing my job, and she just shoots me down in front of everybody.
 I don't care if she's the boss, Liz is a grade-A-- Runt! What? This kitten, he's such a runt! I'm gonna name you Runty.
 You're such a little raging little runt! Come on, Runty.
 Come on.
 Jack, how are you? Ted, Amanda, so nice to see you.
 Hello.
 This is Tracy Jordan.
 Ted here is the head of our commercial aviation division.
 You need to hook me up with one of them helicopters.
 Absolutely.
 I'd be happy to arrange for you to take a ride.
 No, I don't want to get in it.
 I want to blow it up and run away from it in slow motion.
 Pleasure to have met you.
 Damn straight.
 I'm delightful.
 You're doing great.
 Everybody loves you.
 On season five, when Delta was really packin' it on--- Glorious.
 We need to fire Lutz.
 Why, what happened? He called me the worst name ever.
 What did he call you? I'm not gonna repeat it.
 That's how much I hate it.
 Fat can? No.
 Mouth hooker? No.
 Monster bitch.
 Hatchet face.
 No! The one the rhymes with the name of your favorite Todd Rundgren album.
 It rhymes with Hermit of Mink Hollow? No! Oh.
 Oh boy.
 Well, you know, he was probably just blowing off steam.
 You can't fire a guy for cursing.
 I'm not upset about cursing.
 I mean, I love cursing.
 I love it.
 But this word is not acceptable because there's nothing you can call a guy back.
 There is no male equivalent to this word.
 Well, why don't we come up with one and then you can call him that? Likemonkus.
 Fungdark.
 No, I'm serious, you guys.
 You're just in reaction right now.
 You need to just take a few hours and calm down.
 Don't tell me to calm down you fungdark.
 Yeah, you're right.
 It doesn't work.
 I don't know, I think Liz is right about this.
 Lutz has been totally slacking off since his grandma died.
 What? Why didn't you guys tell me? I thought you knew and you were just being a You know, that word Lutz called you.
 Wait, are you saying that I am like that sometimes? Um Um And they thought my sister couldn't even have a baby, so she's really excited.
 Oh, he's adorable.
 Okay, we're at the bottom of page two.
 Hey, look everybody Sherlock Homo is here to solve the case of the gay sweater.
 I'm telling you guys watching that isn't gonna get us out of here any faster.
 Oh, my God, I am.
 I'm a total Runt! Runt! I lost my kitten.
 Has anyone seen my runt? Runt! Runt! Bringing Tracy Jordan was a smart move, Jack.
 He's the hit of the party.
 You got that right, my friend.
 Tomorrow I'm gonna be in an intense six hour foursome with three other men.
 And one of them will be Don Geiss and he's gonna get all of my attention.
 And you're just gonna sit back and watch.
 Would you excuse me? You know the army's been messing with the sun.
 That's why I keep my junk covered.
 Once that stuff get in your hang, you're done.
 Would you excuse us for a moment, please? What's going on? It's game time.
 Jack, you handsome son of a gun! This guy gets younger every time I see him! No, you're the one.
 Oh, hair like a Viking.
 God bless you.
 Don, I want you to meet my friend Tracy Jordan.
 Tracy Jordan.
 This is exciting.
 My grandchildren just love your movies.
 Thank you so much for being here and supporting diabetes research.
 Hey, I feel you.
 Messed up sugar runs in my family too.
 So, how's your short game? You'll find out tomorrow.
 This guys spends so much time in the sand that his nickname should be Falu-ser.
 That's humorous.
 Hey, how come you don't hire more black people around here? Beg your pardon? How come there's no black people here? Black people can't make light bulbs? No, actually we have an award winning diversity program.
 How come there's just me and Carlton over there? I believe Tracy's referring to Carlton, the straight laced brother from Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Are we having fun or what? My associate's name is Francis Callier.
 And he's a lawyer.
 Excuse me.
 So what time does this golf thing kick off tomorrow? It doesn't matter now, Tracy.
 We're not in Geiss' foursome, thanks to you.
 What? I can't help it if he got mad.
 You know me.
 I'm gonna say what's on my mind, Jack.
 No, not in here you don't.
 I wanted you to entertain these people, not publicly humiliate them.
 I'm supposed to just be a funny black man who says funny things.
 No, I wanted you to discuss your astounding medical breakthroughs.
 Okay.
 Bartender, could you bring me a Mustang Melon and a bag of barbeque potato chips? 'Cause apparently I'm only here to be a stereotype.
 Would you keep your voice down, please? You're embarrassing yourself.
 No, I'm not embarrassing myself, I'm embarrassing you.
 And guess what, Jack? I'm just getting started.
 Son, I wasn't joking about those chips.
 Hey hey hey.
 What do you wanna do about Lutz? Should I call him into my office? I think we should wait on that.
 Really? Okay.
 Whatcha got? A-ha! I made something for the writers.
 Brisket! No, it's two dozen cupcakes with melted mini-candy bars in the middle.
 Mmm.
 Oh, I get it.
 You're trying to be nice now 'cause of what Lutz said.
 No, I'm not trying to be nice.
 I am nice.
 I'm a nice person you bald, gangly I'm gonna try harder.
 I'm gonna try and be nice.
 I sure hope Mr.
 Jack plays his game good today.
 Otherwise he whups my ass right well when we get home.
 Ain't that right, Mr.
 Jack? You know, Ted, Kenneth here is one of our most promising young pages.
 He knows everything there is to know about the business.
 I studied TV theory at Kentucky Mountain Bible College.
 I studied fried chicken at the school of hard knocks.
 Ain't that right, Mr.
 Jack? You still here? I'm ridiculous.
 I'm black! I may even be ugly.
 But dear God I'm here! I'm here! And nothing but them can keep me from it! Oh, I'm so sorry.
 I'm so sorry.
 I thought I turned it off.
 No, Cooper, take the call.
 I mean, come on.
 This isn't Hitler's bunker.
 That would make me Hitler.
 What? This is the new me.
 Do you like the new me? Before you answer, superballs! Awesome! What a fun boss you have, right? Would you like me to do a tap dance for you and your big time friends, Mr.
 Jack? Or I could run around while y'all are throwing rocks at me.
 Kenneth, play this hole for me, would you? Come with me.
 What are you doing? Payback.
 The way you treated me.
 You used me.
 God, it's like dating Katie Couric all over again.
 I didn't use you.
 I created a situation that could have been mutually beneficial, and you blew it.
 If you can't handle Tracy Jordan, don't invite Tracy Jordan.
 This is what I do.
 I drop truth bombs.
 I don't care about Don Geiss! I'm a movie star! Oh, my.
 No, no.
 You were a movie star.
 You haven't gotten a movie made in over two years, and you know why? Because of your truth bombs.
 Remind me, Tracy, what did you tell the president of Warner Brothers? Told him he could suck it.
 And the president of Paramount? Told her she could kiss my delicious ass.
 And how's that working for you? Yeah, I thought so.
 Hey, why don't you play the game with me? Like it or not, guys like Geiss run everything, including movie studios.
 And we could be playing golf with him right now instead of Ted, who's best known for getting caught using a corporate credit card at a gay strip club.
 I'm sorry, Amanda, you were bound to find that out eventually.
 Where is everybody? Oh, they all had personal problems they had to take care of.
 Go, go.
 If I thought I left my coffeemaker on, I wouldn't be able to focus either.
 No, no, I get it.
 Everyone should see Mama Mia before it closes.
 What kind of sinus stuff? I'm just having some weird sinus stuff.
 Okay.
 Go home.
 Then I sent Lutz and Frank out to get us some pizzas and they never came back.
 So you're finishing up everyone's re-writes by yourself? That's not right.
 Yes, but at least I know that nobody hates me today.
 You think Jack Donagee sits up there and worries if people are saying bad things about him? It's different for women.
 I don't think it is.
 Sometimes people hate their bosses.
 Big deal.
 But you gotta stick up for yourself.
 Because if you don't they'll take advantage of you.
 Oh, hey, could I borrow 60 bucks? I'm going to meet Frank and Lutz at Scores.
 So I founded the Don Geiss Diabetes Research Foundation which is why you're all here tonight.
 Gwen and I really hope you'll be as generous with your checkbooks as you were on the links today with your scorekeeping.
 Thank you.
 What's he doing? Excuse me! I know I wasn't asked to say anything, but I would like to share my experience with you.
 When my daughter Shahita was born, she had chubby arms and legs and a big bald head.
 She looked like my Uncle Rupert in a diaper.
 By the time she was five, she was 87 pounds.
 I mean, she could eat! But then, when was around eight years old I remember it was Easter.
 We stayed up all night the night before watching bible movies and eating Fiddle Faddle.
 I remember the next day, Easter Sunday, she threw up right in the middle of the Jaguar dealership.
 She was mad sick.
 And I carried her all the way to St.
 Luke's Roosevelt.
 The doctor said she had diabetes.
 I get very upset because I think I was the cause of that due to my ignorance of nutrition.
 And I promised Sha that night that I was gonna dedicate all my efforts to raise awareness and finding a cure.
 And I just hope that all of you will join me.
 Thank you.
 Unbelievable! Record donations.
 I can't thank you enough.
 Jack, I'm gonna be on the Vineyard next month.
 I want you and Tracy to come up, and we'll talk about getting you back in the movie business.
 I'll set that up, sir.
 Okay.
 Tracy, bring your daughter.
 That's a deal.
 Thanks again.
 Congratulations, Tracy.
 And welcome to the grown up world.
 Yeah.
 I don't have a daughter.
 Let's have a casting session on Monday.
 Grace There is something that I must say to you.
 But my words cannot suffice.
 So to quote Mr.
 Jerry McGuire.
 you make me a complete person.
 When you said hello, you had me.
 My wife needs her sweater.
 Ow! Yes, sir! You're watching the Designing Women Marathon on Nick at Nite.
 Sir, you may be right.
 I may be not capable of understanding normal thinking because I think a woman is just as powerful as a man.
 And until you learn to respect me, you better learn to stay out of my way.
 'Cause this is my house.
 This is my house.
 Staying up all night re-writing The Amazing Hobo.
 You fat nerd.
 Good morning, Lemon.
 Hey, Jack, come on! You stay up all night? How can you tell? This is the men's room.
 Oh! Did you win your golf parade? Even better.
 Next weekend Tracy and I are gonna double team Don Geiss with our big ideas.
 You're so weird.
 Now get out of here.
 I have to yell at my staff.
 Because I'm not just feminine, I also can project my power.
 Didn't you bake us anything? Hey, I thought you were gonna being snickerdoodles in.
 That's the only reason I showed up.
 I mean, you can't promise snickerdoodles and then not bring any.
 That's not cool.
 Listen up, everybody.
 Listen to me.
 Listen! Shh shh shh shh shh.
 There will be no more baked goods.
 No more walking all over me.
 I was here all night doing your work.
 But at 3:30 this morning, I happened to see this episode of Designing Women.
 And when it came on again at 5:30, I taped it.
 And I want you all to watch very closely.
 Because it sums up so perfectly what I wanna say to you.
 What do I hit, input? Is there a TV/VCR button? What is aux? Hey, can I go now? Hang on.
 I want your full attention! Why is it making that noise? Ugh.
 Okay, never mind.
 But I want to say something to all of you.
 I am the boss here.
 And sometimes that's gonna make me unpopular.
 But the point is I know what you called me, Lutz.
 Oh.
 I'm sorry that I said that.
 Please don't make me move back to Alaska, Liz.
 I hate it there.
 You can stay.
 But if you ever If any of you ever call me that horrible word again, I will fire you.
 And you will never alter drapes in Atlanta again.
 Because you do not cross a Sugarbaker woman! I'm so tired.
 I'm so tired, you guys.
 All right, champ.
 It's nonny time.
   

                




                    			Wow, this is an honor.
 I am friends with number four on Maxim's list comedy.
 Thanks.
 At first I was mad that Jessica Simpson was ahead of me.
 But then I saw the Dukes of Hazzard.
 Funny! What is that, baby oil? Actually, they use salad dressing, 'cause it gets a better sheen.
 This is ridiculous.
 What does any of this have to do with comedy? Ya burnt! Listen, I just I wanna make sure you're not gonna regret this, you know? Because it's not just cute guys that buy these magazines, it's teenage boys with weird rashes and old guys that live at the Y.
 Liz, posing in Maxim is a great career move.
 There's no shame in it.
 I'm laughin', I'm horny, let's do this! Put the chicken near your mouth.
 Awesome.
 Oh! Well, you look happy.
 Somebody just have a root beer float? No, Josh's contract is up, which means it's time for my favorite thing in the world, negotiation.
 The essence of capitalism.
 There's nothing like it.
 God, I wish there was something I could negotiate with right now.
 Hey, Jack? Just a reminder, I need a couple minutes to go over breakage today-- how's noon? Can't do that.
 Make it 4:00 AM.
 That's no good.
 What about after rehearsal? Stop insulting me.
 Midnight.
 You bring the coffee.
 That's my final.
 Done.
 Wow, you do have a talent.
 I can't wait to go mano a mano with Josh.
 Right, I think you mean mano a toddler.
 Josh is a very sweet, very dumb kid.
 Please go easy on him.
 I'll try to remember that when you and I meet with him later.
 What, me? No.
 Don't make me be part of this.
 Lemon, I would like to teach you something.
 I would like to be Michelle Pfeiffer to your angry black kid who learns that poetry is just another way to rap.
 No, Jack, I don't wanna learn about negotiation.
 I just want Josh to stay.
 The show needs him.
 Lesson number one, you don't need anyone.
 Sure, Josh tests well with female viewers 12 to 24, which is important to advertisers, because young women will buy just about anything.
 These sunglasses have a chip in them that makes the lenses change color as my iPod loses power.
 But whatever Josh brings to the show, he's still replaceable.
 He's not replaceable as my friend.
 He's not your friend now, he's your opponent.
 He's going to try to grab all the marbles, and it's our job to hide them.
 That's not how you play marbles, Jack.
 But that's how you keep them.
 Yo, remember that email we got from those Nigerians that needed our help gettin' all that money out of Africa? We did it! I got the check today.
 Say word? Word is bond.
 I would have been happy if our only reward was just helping that dethroned prince of Nigeria, but this is great! We should treat ourselves.
 Want to go to Vegas and buy a bunch of sarcophagi? Nah.
 I don't even use the ones I have.
 We could add someone else to the entourage.
 That's a good idea.
 Yo, what's young Larry doing these days? He's in Jay-Z's entourage.
 What about Cheese? He's rolling with Ghostface Killer now.
 Fatballz? Studying hotel administration at Cornell.
 Well, go ahead, Fatballz! That's a good program.
 Hello there, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Mr.
 Slattery, Mr.
 Griswold.
 I picked up your lunch from Sylvia's.
 Extra cornbread because I know you like it.
 Like it? I love it! I love this cornbread so much I wanna take it behind a middle school and get it pregnant.
 Pregnant cornbread.
 K, you like doing stuff for me, right? How would you like to be in my entourage? Well, that sounds like fun! What would I do? Well, let's see.
 Dotcom does the driving and the cooking.
 Grizz is in charge of sitting on me when I get over stimulated.
 But I have been looking for someone to harmonize with me.
 The sun'll come out Tomorrow Tomorrow Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow Fa la la la There'll be sun This is a really special day.
 Just thinking about to-- Nice.
 Yowza.
 Isn't it great? These are the sexiest women in comedy? Where's Jackée? Jenna, have you read your interview yet? Oh, no.
 Did I come across as interesting? 'Cause I tried to mention Bono as much as possible.
 No, you come across as crazy.
 Why did you tell the reporter that you hate the troops? What? I didn't say I hate the troops.
 but it's just a bunch of gay guys that like to get in silly costumes and prance around.
 No, Liz, he heard me wrong.
 You know that I love the troops.
 Do you remember that fleet week after I broke up with David? Oh, God, this is bad.
 Nobody reads the articles in these things, right? Maybe no one'll pick it up? These Hollyweirdos from La La Land like Jenna Moron-ey are just un-American! So we are calling for a boycott of NBC, General Electric, and their parent company the Sheinhardt Wig Corporation.
 Jack, I was misquoted.
 This is my fault.
 I never should have let her do this Maxim thing in the first place.
 We're going to nip this thing in the bud.
 Jenna is going to make a public apology tomorrow on Hardball.
 You know what that is, don't you? Yes.
 Should I prepare a song? I really can't wait to renegotiate your contract.
 Thank you, sir.
 What? Hey.
 Does my vulva look swollen? Come here.
 I just wanna warn you as a friend about this contract thing.
 Jack is gunning for you.
 Really? Don't worry, you're not going anywhere.
 Jack said advertisers love you, because you test great with women 12 to 24.
 Which advertisers? Could I get free Choco Sticks? Just don't be pushy about your contract, and I promise we will get through this.
 Yeah, um Alan actually told me not to talk to anybody about this.
 Alan? Who's Alan? Jacuzzi, the whole nine yards.
 Jack.
 Jack Donaghy.
 Alan Steiner.
 Good to see ya.
 I'm Josh Gerard's agent.
 Oh, really? Listen, I'd love to grab a little face time with you re: Josh's contract offer.
 We've got some serious troubs, my friend.
 We are not smiles-times.
 I'm sorry to hear that, Alan.
 What your skedge mañana? 'Cause this is gonna be one serious negosh.
 My skedge is wide open, Alan.
 Hasta mañana.
 What a man, what a man what a mighty good man Mighty mighty good man Yeah! So, entourage, what's on the schedule for today? I have us penciled in for Halo.
 I love Halo! I love Halo so much, I wanna take it out behind a middle school and get it pregnant! Why are you guys laughing so hard? That's the same joke Mr.
 Jordan said earlier.
 I don't think so, K.
 'Cause I like to keep my material fresh.
 I like to keep things fresh so much, that I wanna take it out behind the middle school and get it pregnant.
 Whoa, who just killed me? That's never happened before.
 I did, Mr.
 Jordan! That's impossible! I've beat all the world's best players.
 Grizz, Dotcom, my publicist, my stylist Oh, well I just killed you again! You're cheating! And I don't wanna play no more! I hate this! Grizz! I think it's best you come sit on me.
 And I just want the troops to kill everyone and come on home.
 Pretty good.
 But this is Hardball, Jenna, so you might wanna be more specific.
 You could say that you support the troops, but you feel that the war was poorly planned and started under false pretenses.
 And that we should have used those resources to hunt down Osama Bin Laden.
 Liz, I'm just worried that I'm gonna sound like I don't know what I'm talking about.
 Hey, would Sharon Stone worry about that? Mm-mm.
 Would Richard Gere? No.
 Then you go out there and you voice your opinions like a star.
 Okay, what are you gonna do if they ask about '08? Well, of course I want Hillary to be the first woman president.
 Ugh.
 No, Obama.
 You support Barrack Obama.
 Remember, you liked those pictures of him at the beach? Oh, right.
 Obama, what is he, Hispanic? No, he's black.
 And he's running for President? Good luck.
 Is this new furniture? This is my negotiation set.
 What? Gentlemen, please sit down.
 All right, let's skip the foreplay and get right to the penetraish.
 Josh is looking for a 15% raise, a two-pic guarantee from Universal, and time off for every Jewish holiday no matter how ridiculous.
 I mean, Yaznach is coming up.
 That seems pretty reasonable, right, Jack? Here's my counteroffer.
 One dollar.
 What? Oh, boy.
 That's absurd.
 You know what's absurd? These photos I found of Josh roughhousing with Lance Bass at SeaWorld.
 What, we were just being silly.
 My offer is now 75 cents.
 Tic toc tic toc tic toc.
 It keeps getting lower.
 I think we should take it.
 Relax.
 Look, Jack we know about the testing.
 Women from 12 to 24 love my guy.
 Who told you that? Oh, Liz did.
 Shut up.
 What? That was privileged information.
 That's what I thought.
 Awse.
 We are back in the game.
 I knew you weren't ready for a big chair.
 Yo, Kenneth, we need to talk, man.
 Oh, I've had this conversation before.
 You're marrying my mom, aren't you? No.
 It's about how you're treating Tracy.
 You're beating him at Halo, you're not laughing at his jokes.
 He's the king around here.
 You gotta respect that.
 Oh, my gosh.
 I had no idea I was causing a problem.
 Hey, I got next game.
 Hold up.
 How are you beating Kenneth, Grizz? I don't know.
 If Kenneth can beat me, and you can beat Kenneth, then by the transitive property, you should beat me too! Have you been letting me win? Just at some things.
 Things? Plural? What is the world's only egg-laying mammal? The Easter bunny! Right again! That's a green pie piece.
 Amazed.
 Raaah! Yeah, what, cat? Yeah, Dotcom! Yeah, Grizz! Have you two been treating me like this all this time? Like a child? No no no, I won't stand for this.
 Entourage disbanded! Oh, my.
 Tucker Carlson, you heard what Jenna Maroney had to say.
 She supports the troops.
 Well, here's a question, Chris.
 Why do we care what she thinks about anything? This woman strikes me as another empty-headed self-involved member of the Hollywood ignorati.
 You know, for someone who's super super hot, you're really cranky.
 I have just as much right to my opinion as you or Chris.
 I'm not sure you do.
 You've been on the show for 20 minutes now.
 You sang six bars of something called Muffin Top.
 Thank you.
 And then told a disgusting story about Fleet Week.
 I guess this is the state of political discourse in this country nowadays.
 And that's fine, let's just embrace it.
 Let's have our policies determined by former Cable Ace Award nominees.
 First, I was great in that Arliss.
 Second of all, if they president is so serious about the war of terror, why doesn't he hunt down and capture Barrack Obama before he strikes again? It's time for a change, America.
 That's why I'm voting for Osama in 2008.
 Oh, no comeback? Ya burnt! Hey, Jack, I was totally gonna call you.
 Which of your massive screw-ups should we discuss first? How about the Jenna situation? That is taken care of.
 I have written an op ed piece for the New York Times under Jenna's name in which I put the media on trial.
 Boo! Here's the plan.
 We're gonna take Jenna, put some flags behind her, have her sing a song that rhymes USA with "Make them pay," dress her in an eagle costume, and we're gonna call it a salute to the troops episode.
 Okay.
 Moving on, Josh Gerard.
 I had him right where I wanted him.
 Until my partner stabbed me in the back.
 I didn't mean to do that.
 I'm sorry.
 I was just trying to give my friend a head's up.
 Why can't we all just sit down in normal chairs and figure this out? Suri, is Josh in yet? Josh isn't coming in today.
 He's sick.
 He said he was throwing up all night.
 A sick out? I didn't think he had it in him.
 What are you talking about? He's faking.
 He's gonna stay home until we give in to his demands.
 No, Josh could not come up with a sneaky plan like that.
 He told me he was a pallbearer at his brother's wedding.
 He's probably just sick because he's stressed out about his job.
 Lemon, what happened in your childhood to make you believe that people are good? You know what? If my friendships and my job are in compatible, I choose my friends.
 And right now, I am going to get some chicken soup from Josh's favorite place and take it to him and say that I hope he feels better.
 Do you ever get any emails other than from match.
com? No no, don't look at that.
 Aaah! Damn it! Close, right? Feel like I'm above the rim.
 Can't palm the ball.
 Sir, I think you made a mistake firing Grizz and Dotcom.
 They just wanna make you feel better about yourself.
 They disrespected me.
 But don't you miss them? You're the only one I can trust, K.
 You're my whole entourage now.
 Oh, I'm not so sure I can handle that.
 Yes, you can.
 Because you were honest with me.
 I don't need a couple of yes-men.
 I need the truth.
 Well, if that's the case then you should know that you're never gonna dunk this basketball.
 Also, that Oscar you have is made of chocolate.
 And that lady you European kissed last night was actually a gentleman Okay, that's enough.
 Oh, here comes one right now.
 Excuse me, do you work for NBC? Oh, no, I was just passing through there on my way to church.
 Well, are you interested in taking back your country? Am I! Then join here tomorrow night for a protest against the freedom-hating Jenna Maroney and TGS! There will be snacks! I will definitely be there.
 Large chicken soup to go, please.
 John and I saw your tape.
 Very very impressed.
 You seem like a perfect match for The Daily Show.
 We are always looking for new correspondents.
 Josh? You stupid turd.
 Hey! Liz.
 This is Yeah, I can guess who this is.
 Are you trying to get on another show? Behind my back? Look, Liz, I'm sorry.
 It's just business.
 No, it's not business.
 I stood up for you.
 You were opening for a puppet when I found you.
 How could you betray me like this? You know, that's not even the worst part.
 You know what the worst part is? You proved Jack Donaghy right! Again! And by the way, what kind of moron calls out sick and then comes to work to have a meeting? I get an NBC discount here.
 Idiot! I'm a big fan of your show.
 I want you to crush Josh.
 I want you to crush him.
 Mr.
 Jordan, Keith called on your cell.
 He said they were "at the thing, and Lil' Zay just end up running.
" What did you tell him? Well, he wanted Dwayne Jr.
's number, so I gave it to him.
 You did what? Damn it, K, now I have to hear from Tanisha's mom on how they both mad at the twins.
 You have to handle this stuff better.
 Mr.
 Jordan, I don't know any of these people.
 But Grizz would have Damn it, turn on the TV for me.
 Dotcom set this up.
 I don't know how it works.
 Television on! Pornography! Good, you're here.
 Josh and his agent are on their way up.
 Ha ha, yeah.
 Then they're gonna be on their way down.
 Um, you know, that was weak.
 But you're in the mix, you're having fun.
 I like that.
 Gentlemen! Make yourselves comfortable.
 What are all these headshots for? Nothing.
 Just some meetings we're taking.
 Meetings? And if Look, Jack, I think I should tell you, Josh has an offer from The Daily Show.
 Yes, Liz mentioned that.
 I don't think that's gonna pan out.
 What, are you kidding? What happened? What'd you do to our offer? I called my friend Saul Sheinhardt at our parent company Sheinhardt Wigs who called his nephew Morty Sheinhardt who called his son, John Stewart.
 Ah ha Ya burnt! Let's get down to brass tacks.
 Josh can stay.
 Thank God! But no raise, no movies.
 And only one Jewish holiday.
 What's the one where they go into the tent? Sukkot.
 That's the one.
 We have a deal? Deal, thank you.
 I need this money.
 I have a really bad sex addiction.
 Sorry.
 That's it? I thought you said we could crush him.
 What are you talking about? I took away everything.
 That's crushing.
 No, do more stuff! You made me look like an idiot.
 You have to pay.
 Liz, he's not getting a raise.
 Do the worm! Do the worm! Good Lord, the worm! That's so degrading.
 Are its origins German? Now say five reasons I'm better than you! Smarter than me.
 One! You can beat me in arm wrestling.
 Two! You read the paper.
 Yeah, suck it, I do read the paper.
 You want me to do anything? Be a crab! Crab.
 Fight the worm! Wow! Liz, you took to this like a natural.
 More than I ever Okay, now, the crab is getting aroused.
 Shut it down.
 Shut it down.
 Small town worn fatigues Big dreams and little leagues Gigantic star-spangled fireworks Light up the night You know, you actually did a good job on this.
 Why do you sound so surprised? I love America.
 Just because I think gay dudes should be allowed to adopt kids and we should all have hybrid cars, doesn't mean I don't love America.
 I said America She said America.
 And cue the pinwheels.
 Okay, the pinwheels are lit, but they're not spinning.
 When they're not spinning, they look exactly like Swastikas.
 TGS, Totally Godless Suckers.
 Or Satanists.
 Ooh, that's even better.
 Hi! Entourage Oh! You gotta get me out of here! Make a path, please! Help! Wow, Tray, you really saved us from that crowd, yo.
 You sure did, man.
 You sure did.
 Yeah.
 Of course I did! I love you guys.
 I love you so much, I'm gonna take you behind the middle school and get you pregnant.
 I love you, Dotcom.
 I love you, Grizz.
 And I will always love you And I will always love you   

                




                    			That's a wrap.
 Monday's call time is 9:00 AM.
 Good show, Liz Lemon! You coming to the after-after party.
 We have after-after parties? Hey, I'm Steven! Hi, Sven! I'm Liz.
 Yo, Lemon! You comin' to the after-after-after party? Sure.
 I'm Tracy's new business manager.
 He gave me tickets to see the show.
 Oh, cool.
 Let's blow this joint! It's about to turn back into a taxi dispatch center.
 You going to the after-after-after-after party? Okay.
 Well, let's rock.
 Don't go, Liz Lemon! There's still a after-after- after-after-after-party! I just gotta take my kids to soccer first.
 The inaugural vintage.
 "Donaghy Estates?" It's from that vineyard on the north fork of Long Island that I bought.
 I told you about that.
 No, you didn't.
 Oh Must've been Angie Harmon.
 Boy, I'm really excited about this.
 After 20 years of working for big companies, I finally have my own name on something.
 I know what you mean.
 When I was eight, I had my name on the score board at a Phillies game.
 And they spelled it "Lez" but it was pretty cool.
 Well, this ought to prove my mother wrong, saying that Donaghy is Gaelic for "failure.
" Huh, what the hell does she know? She's a Murphy.
 Bunch of mud farmers and sheep rapists.
 Well, congratulations.
 Yes.
 Umm.
 Oh, I'm gonna vomit! What the hell am I gonna do? I've got 10,000 cases of this crap.
 Hey, am I interrupting? No.
 Hey, Steven How are things going with Tracy? I'm making progress on his IRS problems.
 You two know each other? Well, I referred Tracy to Steven, who's an executive vice president at the investment firm of Dewey, Cheatham, and Livingston.
 I just swung by to see if we were still on for tonight.
 Oh, yeah, of course.
 Good.
 See you tonight.
 Well, well, well, Lemon! Steven's a good man.
 He's on partner track at Dewey.
 And he's a Black.
 A black? That is offensive.
 No, no-- That's his last name.
 Steven Black.
 Good family.
 Oh, yeah, of course.
 Remarkable people, the Blacks.
 Musical, very athletic.
 Not very good swimmers.
 Again, I'm talking about the family.
 Black is African American though.
 Well, I don't care about that.
 Well, I know that is the type of thing we tell ourselves, but trust me.
 When I was dating Condoleezza, there were genuine cultural tensions.
 I mean, we would go to the movies, and she would yell at the screen.
 I don't even notice those kind of things.
 You know, when I leave work at night, I am just riding on a subway car full of scary, teenaged people.
 Mr.
 Jordan, I have a message for you from a Mr.
 Ridikolus.
 Ridikolus-- the hip-hop producer? Isn't that the guy that bit Suge Knight? Yeah, yeah-- He bit Suge Knight.
 Held Raven Simone over a balcony.
 Made Rasheed Wallace cry.
 Dude is crazy! I don't want him calling me.
 Oh, he didn't call, Mr.
 Jordan.
 He gave me the message after I wouldn't let him into your party the other night.
 What? I'll call you when I get it-- I'm sorry, this is a private party.
 Hold on.
 We're with Tracy Jordan.
 And Mr.
 Jordan himself said, "Don't let no one in who's not on the list "'Cause this mess is gonna get raw like sushi, so haters to the left.
" Hey! Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
 What's your game, man? Boggle.
 Come on, come on.
 But you know what? You tell Tracy Jordan that Ridikolus "Is gonna eat his family.
" Excuse me, won't you? Oh, hey! Oh I'm sorry-- Who died? Nobody.
 I have a date.
 Really? With that guy that sent you the flowers? By mistake? No, that guy has a girlfriend.
 Technicality.
 Although, I did see flower guy recently.
 And it was pretty excellent.
 Hey, Liz Lemon.
 Hey, workout flower guy.
 Whattaya got there? The old leather pumpkin? Oh, I'm sorry.
 What? I was just saying, um You got the old leather pumpkin.
 Ugh.
 But he's taken, so I'm gonna go out with this guy Steven that I met at the after party.
 Oh, that cute black guy? Why am I the only person that doesn't care that he's black? Race is a huge issue in this country, according to Newsweek magazine.
 Well, it's 2007 and some of us don't have those hang-ups.
 And good morning to you, sir.
 Come on in, Lemon.
 Tracy, what seems to be the problem.
 Tracy who? You're lookin' at a ghost, JD.
 Dead Man Walking, The Green Mile, Christmas With the Klumps.
 Is this about Ridikolus? Because I think you're overreacting.
 Look, I am old school.
 Growing up, when you were mad at somebody, you would just break dance at 'em.
 I'm talking about break hard, pull it back-- pop, boom, boom-- Into gladiator-- Bring it back down.
 Yeah, I'm familiar with break dancing.
 Okay.
 Worm it out.
 And then pop! Boom! Now brothers just shoot you! Oh, no, no-- Look-- Ridikolus is the biggest hip-hop producer in New York City, and he was disrespected at my party! This may be a great opportunity.
 For what? To unload some of this awful wine.
 Tracy, for years, Cristal was the hip-hop champagne, until the president of Roederer committed a fateful error.
 Cristal has since been boycotted in the rap community, creating a vacuum which could be filled by Donaghy Estates sparkling wine.
 Which, according to this lab report, "contains no lead and is not fatal if swallowed.
" Mm.
 If you get rich off of this stuff, just take care of my family.
 I don't want my kids to have to go to college.
 Tracy, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
 You have my word.
 To success.
 Is that a piece of corn in there? So, uh, you like comedy.
 Mm-hmm.
 Have you heard of Mark Russell? Yeah, that's the guy that plays the ragtime songs about politics.
 Yes! He's wonderful.
 He has this one-- You better watch out.
 Don't make a flap.
 'Cause Hilary's wearing a Yankees cap.
 Oh boy, are you singing? Yes! It's just so funny.
 So, how about Lost this season? Sorry, I don't own a TV.
 Really? What do you sit and look at? I have hobbies.
 I participate in Vietnam war reenactments.
 And I take pictures of interesting doors.
 And I spend a lot of free time blogging about Star Wars.
 Oh, really? You like Star Wars? I love it.
 I was Princess Leia, like, four Halloweens in a row Recently.
 No no no no-- Not the fantasy movie with the, uh, monsters.
 I'm talking about the Strategic Defense Initiative.
 Yeah, we should probably go ahead and order.
 This Porterhouse for two looks good.
 I'm just gonna get a salad.
 I really don't care about food.
 And yet no brand has emerged to fill that market gap at present.
 There is no club drink.
 That's where Donaghy Estates comes in.
 Now, as you may have read in Robert Parker's wine newsletter, "Donaghy Estates tastes like "the urine of Satan after a hefty portion of asparagus.
" But this is not a question of taste.
 Sure.
 I mean, it's about branding, it's about perception.
 Exactly, and the ideal opportunity to launch a new drink label is right around the corner: The Source Awards.
 Well, I'm producing the Source Awards.
 And I would like Donaghy Estates to be your corporate sponsor.
 You ever have more money than you could shake a stick at? Well, pick out a stick.
 'Cause Ridikolus is gonna be drinking Donaghy Estates tonight.
 Excellent.
 Now, I also hope this means you'll set aside your problem with my friend Tracy Jordan.
 No, I don't think I could let that go that easy.
 What if he makes it up to you? Who's hosting the Source Awards? What about Tracy? Hey, Matthew, you want some juicy office gossip? They're closing the C-bank elevators for maintenance.
 Wow, that would've been a great way to shoot Tracy.
 Well, maybe next time.
 We're you gentlemen not given visitors' badges, Or did you all just not feel like wearing them.
 Jack, what's up with your man? This is just our Kenneth.
 How's it going, Kenneth? He's very unstable.
 Eh, did you get that at a cane shop? So then Zoolander goes, "Mm.
" Yeah, I've seen the movie.
 Yeah, but when you see it on an airplane, they take out all the swears and stuff, and it makes it so much funnier, I think.
 Ah, gracias.
 Wow, this has been so much fun.
 We should do this again.
 Oh, yeah sure.
 The night's young.
 We should take a carriage ride around the financial district.
 Okay, Steven-- you're obviously a really nice guy.
 But I just don't think we're a good match.
 Yeah, I know.
 I get it.
 It's because I'm black.
 What? I said I get it.
 You don't like me, because I am black! You think I'm racist? That is just nasty, negative-- What did you call me under your breath? Nothing! I am not racist.
 I love black men! I love you! This is fantastic.
 Let's get dessert.
 Death by Chocolate.
 No, no-- not that kind of chocolate.
 Steven played the race card? Yes! What did you do? What could I do? I picked up the check and I made out with him a little bit in the taxi.
 Maybe if I just hang out with him four or five more teams, he'll see on his own that we are a bad match.
 Why do you do this to yourself? If you don't like him, end it.
 Who cares if he thinks you're a racist.
 I do because I'm not! Ah, than Ahman-da.
 It's Amanda.
 What are you gonna do? Tom Cruise, 'cause that's how Oprah says it.
 "Tom!" That's good; sounds like her.
 Tracy, good news.
 I think I solved your problem with Ridikolus.
 For real, Jack? All you have to do is agree to host the Source Awards on Saturday.
 The Source Awards? No no no no no! What's the problem? Death sentence number two.
 Shooting people at the Source Awards is a tradition.
 It's like Christmas.
 Or shooting people outside of Hot 97.
 Tracy, don't worry.
 Ridikolus and I are in business together now.
 And business heals all wounds.
 I mean, look at our relationship with Germany or Japan.
 Who could even remember what all the fuss was about? It's not about Ridikolus.
 Who else is gonna be at this thing? Well, you're gonna be sharing the stage with Nas.
 Nope! He hates me! We used to date the same girl.
 What about Young Jeezy? Forget about it.
 I called his pitbull a gaywad on 106 &amp; Park.
 That would do it.
 The Game? Nope.
 TI? Ain't nothin' happening.
 Superhead? No can do.
 Fabolus? Won't do.
 Rindonkeykong? No! MC Scatcat? What? Homunculus? Mm-mm.
 Raw Dog? Hell no! Me and his beef go way back.
 We were both cast members on a Nickelodeon show called Ray Ray's Mystery Garage.
 Brush your teeth Brush your teeth When it's time for bed You gotta brush your teeth Hey, chump-- You scuffed my sneakers! Dr.
 J wears these! I'm sorry, man-- I'm pretty drunk.
 You know what? I'm gonna eat your family! Tracy, if it will make you feel any more comfortable, I'd be happy to loan you a handgun.
 What? Oh, Mother-- I forgot you were there.
 No, he's not taking a gun.
 Tracy, just tell them you can't go.
 If I don't go, Ridikolus is gonna kill me.
 If I do go, someone else is gonna kill me.
 See, it's a Catch 22! Aw, he's gonna be there too.
 God! Yo, my Gs, we roll 50 deep In the club, VIP Sippin' on Donaghy 'Cause I can get raw and take names Just like LeBron James And Donaghy kind of rhymes with party Which is cool This is nasty.
 I gots to get outta here.
 I gotta take a break.
 I can't drink any more of this.
 My tummy's killin' me.
 Okay, cut! Everybody take five.
 Ghostface, you think you could mention DonaghyEstates.
com at any point? Okay, Jack.
 I'll go get my rhyming dictionary.
 Tracy hasn't returned any of my calls.
 Do we still have a deal, Jack? Don't worry.
 He'll be there.
 What color plane you want to buy? Clear like Wonder Woman's.
 You don't realize how beautiful the sunset is till it's the last one you'll ever see.
 Ken.
 I'll be going soon.
 But I just wanted you to know that I've loved being your mentor.
 And it's been an honor having you be my manatee.
 Oh.
 Mr.
 Jordan, I hate seeing you like this.
 What can I do to help you? Nothing, Ken.
 I'm just going through the classic stages of grief.
 Fear Denial Horniness Wisdom, sleepiness-- And now, depression.
 What about anger? No, I don't want to do anger! You can't make me! Now, stop it, Mr.
 Jordan.
 You need to take some of your own advice.
 Aren't you the man who told me to live every week like it's Shark Week? And that nothing's impossible except for dinosaurs.
 Don't give up on life, sir.
 Wow! The manatee has become the mento.
 Wow! Hey, Steven.
 Can I talk to you? Sure, I was just gonna call you.
 Now, I know you like food.
 So I found this really neat Canadian restaurant in Times Square.
 Look, I need you to understand something.
 I don't want to go out with you, and it has nothing to do with your race.
 Okay.
 Steven, listen to me, okay? And please believe what I'm saying.
 I truly don't like you as a person.
 Can't one human being not like another human being? Can't we all just not get along? Liz, I wish it could be like that.
 And maybe someday, our children or our children's children will hate each other like that.
 But it just doesn't work that way today.
 So what you're saying is any woman that doesn't like you is racist.
 No-- No no no no no Some women are gay.
 Okay-- How racist is this? I'm going to the Source Awards tomorrow night.
 Well, let me get on the black phone and call the NAACP so they could just send you your medal right now.
 Okay, you know what? You're going with me as my date.
 And you will see that we don't get along as people.
 Yeah? Will there be a gift bag? Probably.
 Okay.
 Well, you can have everything in it.
 Because I collect tote bags.
 Tracy, do you think I'm racist? No--I think you like to dress black men up as Oprah as part of your effort to protect our dignity.
 O, yeah, when you do that impression, don't forget to stretch everything out.
 "We've got John Travoltaaaa!" Tracy, buddy-- You've got to do this Source Awards thing.
 No, I don't.
 Why not? I haven't given up on life yet.
 I have a plan.
 What plan? I'm gonna find a homeless man, dress him up like me, set him on fire, then I'm gonna start a brand-new life in Arizona under the new name "Ron Mexico.
" We're not doing that.
 Look, I need you to do me this favor.
 I know you're nervous.
 Why don't we go down to the pistol range, squeeze off a few rounds.
 Let the guns do the worrying.
 Again with the guns! What is it with men and guns? Well, I think I speak for the both of us when I say because they're metal penises.
 Yeah, well, you can't solve all your problems by shooting someone or setting a stranger on fire.
 Would Oprah do that? Lemon does make a good point, Tracy.
 What would Oprah do? Would she run away from her community, or would she face her problems head-on and try to make a difference at the Source Awards.
 What would I do, Tracy? What would I doooo! Welcome to the 2007 Source Awards.
 That's great news.
 Thank you so much.
 That was the lab.
 The monkey died of natural causes, so we're in the clear.
 It's great doing business with you, Jack.
 You too, Ridikolus.
 Mm--Call me Gerald.
 Oh.
 The choice to be excellent begins with the choice to silence your inner critic.
 Embrace your spirit! What was that? Oprah.
 It was the only way we could get him to come.
 You're all wonders.
 You're all my miracles.
 You're all my children of the corn.
 Hi! Good for you! Good for you! Thank you.
 He's channeling Oprah.
 Why? Because he's articulate? There is something about you that I just don't like.
 Yeah! Hey, can you put my phone in your purse for me? I don't want to drop it when I start crumpin'.
 Why do guys always do this? Bring your own purse.
 I'm gonna get food.
 Here you go! Another case of D.
E.
 I actually tried some before.
 It tasted real good, but it make my tongue turn white.
 Hey, do I look sweet to you? Do I look like sugar? Back away! Oh, he's harmless.
 Don't be ridiculous.
 I am Ridikolus.
 And you better be glad that Jack Donaghy has your back.
 Well, I Got your nose! Jay, go get my nose back.
 Ladies and gentlemen, your host, Mr.
 Tracy Jordan.
 Welcome to the 2007 Source Awards.
 Our chance to come together as a community.
 To not only look into our hearts, but to look under our seats! Because everyone is getting Vermont maple scooo-oones! Oh, man! You did not just scuff these shoes.
 P-Diddy wears these.
 Oh, will he be mad when you give them back? Son, to have you, your moms must be so stupid she thinks Grape Nuts is an STD.
 Well, sir, your mother must not have raised you right, 'cause you're not saying very nice things.
 Girlfriend, Oprah was right! People just want to be together and get free stuff! I didn't really have to bring this.
 Oh, my God! Tracy! How do you get the bullets out of this thing? Son of a bitch! I was looking for the phone in your purse! I wasn't trying to steal anything, you racist! It was an accident! Good God, Lemon-- You shot a Black! No no no no no-- It's cool; that's his last name.
 You gotta be kidding me, Donaghy! First, Mr.
 Furley here disrespects me, and then she shoots my business manager? I got blood on my tote! He's got blood on his tote.
 You're making a mockery of the Source awards.
 Wait till I tell Tupac about this.
 I didn't hear anything.
 Good.
 Get him outta here! Oh, my bad!   

                




                    			What class do you wanna take? Oh, anything that doesn't have the word "strip," "salsa," or "beatz" with a Z in the name of it.
 Cardio Hip-Hop Groove it is then.
 Hey, what's up? Hey! Nothing, just going into the same class you're going into.
 Cool.
 That's a flower guy.
 Hey, I hope I don't sweat on you.
 You can sweat on me.
 This is my girlfriend, Liz Lemler.
 Hi! That's Liz Lemon.
 Oh, the girl who got my flowers.
 Yes.
 Hope you enjoyed them.
 I did--actually, I finally just threw them out this morning 'cause they got that really bad flower smell.
 I kind of couldn't stop smelling them.
 Advanced hip-hop! You ready, here we go! Here we go, take it-- five, six, seven, and One, huh! Hup, yeah! Uh! Whoo! Turn it! Don't give up, ponytail.
 Come on, you got this.
 Lemon, come here, you've gotta see this.
 It's a video of a baby panda sneezing.
 Sit here.
 Don't watch the mother, just watch the baby.
 That is the cutest thing I've ever seen.
 Isn't that adorable? You have to fire 10% of your staff.
 What? We're synergizing backward overflow.
 I don't write the policy, Lemon, I only enforce it.
 No, but I've never fired anybody in my life.
 It's an acquired skill.
 I'm not trying to make your life miserable, but this is coming from the top.
 Now, there are 140 people on this show, so go out there and make 126 people very happy.
 No, I don't think I can do that.
 Everyone that works at this show is indispensable.
 Marco.
 Polo! Marco! Polo! Polo! Polo! Josh, you suck at this game, man.
 Who cares? Getting fired is better than getting killed by my wife.
 Those big farm people hands crushin' my windpipe.
 Everything okay at home, buddy.
 Remember that little secret I told you about Hornberger family planning? You mean that you flat-out lied about getting a vasectomy? Don't tell me that backfired.
 She's late now.
 And she's starting to ask questions.
 Oh, boy.
 Do you need a key to my apartment? Just for my own safety.
 Hey, Liz Lemon, you know where I can find a good church? How good, like Judaism good, or just like Unitarian? My attorney told me I should join a church preemptively.
 'Cause juries are suspicious of celebrities who find religion after getting into trouble.
 Why don't you try the Church of Practicology? They love movie stars and stuff.
 They already turned me down.
 I'm still not sure what happened.
 I believe the moon doesn't exist.
 I believe that vampires are the world's greatest golfers, but their curse is that they'll never get to prove it.
 I believe that there are 31 letters in the white alphabet.
 Wh--what was the question again? So what's your religion, Liz Lemon? Mm, I pretty much just do whatever Oprah tells me to.
 Can I help you? Yes, sweetheart.
 I'm looking for Jack Donaghy.
 And you are? Eddie Dona-hee, Jack's brother.
 Really? 'Cause Jack never mentioned a brother.
 And his name is Dona-gee, not Dona-hee.
 You know, you could be pretty if you didn't scowl so much.
 Tracy, this is Jack's brother, Eddie.
 Hi.
 Look who I found.
 Eddie Donaghy.
 As I live and breathe.
 You're a disgrace! You're not the boss of me, Jack Donaghy! That's Dona-gee, not Dona-hee! You ruined my suit! Aw, shut up, you baby! Oh, my God, stop! Someone's gonna get hurt! Look, this is about Dad.
 What'd you two dirtbags do now? Fix the Cotton Bowl? Dad's dead.
 It's over.
 Okay? This watch was Dad's.
 He wanted you to have it.
 Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay.
 I haven't seen my dad in 17 years.
 I haven't seen Eddie since I bailed him out of Disney jail.
 And now this watch.
 I'm sorry.
 Don't be.
 My dad and Eddie are a blotch on the Dona-hee name-- Dona-gee name.
 That's how it's pronounced.
 Say it.
 Donaghy.
 Right.
 I really appreciate you bringing me to your church, Ken.
 Hola, Julio.
 I'm glad to help you on your spiritual quest, Mr.
 Jordan.
 What kind of Presbyterian is this? No, we're the Eighth Day Resurrected Covenant of the Holy Trinity.
 We haven't been Presbyterian for months.
 And y'all always meet on Wednesday nights? Yeah, we lose half the congregation every time American Idol starts up.
 Reverend Gary's starting.
 God sees the wicked one.
 Eternal damnation is upon the sinner.
 The stench of rotten flesh fills the air.
 Judgment is upon us all! How will you be seen in his eyes? What? He pointed right at me! He sure did! No! The fires of the pit crackle and pop.
 Hi, I got you coffee.
 Thanks.
 Oh, I forgot your muffin! Banana walnut, your favorite.
 Uh, that's not correct, but okay.
 Good morning, Liz.
 What's all this? Sketches, promos, web content.
 Thoughts for next season.
 Uh-huh.
 Nice hat.
 You haven't heard anything about layoffs, have you? What? No! And even if I had, I'm just being normal.
 Gosh.
 Okay.
 Hey, Liz! You wanna hang out tonight? 'Cause you're totally my role model.
 You make smart sexy.
 There's my beautiful boss.
 Good morning! Good morning, Henry.
 There you go.
 The YMCA, huh? Congratulations, you've found me out.
 So your life's a mess, you go out and buy a new suit, pretend everything's okay.
 Butwhat happened, Eddie? What do you care? I'm happy here.
 Gordon, so help me! Look, I went broke taking care of Dad-- end of story.
 Then let me give you some money.
 No, seeing Dad at the end, it changed me, Jack.
 I got a real job now.
 I talk homeless people into joining the Army.
 Isn't there anything that you want? One thing.
 I'd like my brother back.
 Look, I know I've been nothing but trouble to you your entire life.
 Juvie, Jonestown, that time I punched Goofy.
 Hell, I even blinded you with a bottle rocket! Ah, that was for a couple of lousy months, big deal.
 I had sex with your prom date.
 I stole your identity.
 I threw you out of a window.
 I convinced you you had lupus.
 I microwaved your parakeet.
 I hated that bird.
 We had some great times, didn't we? Yeah.
 Hmm, you're on my good list, Cary.
 Hey, sorry about that.
 Not super appropriate in the workplace.
 No, it's it's only inappropriate when it's ugly people.
 So, um, how long have you guys been together? Oh, well that's tricky.
 Uh, kind of off and on the past year.
 But then she got this job here, and It's kinda tough to stay broken up with someone you have to see everyday.
 Where does she work? Your Liz.
 In accounting.
 On your show.
 She works for you.
 I know who I can fire! You can't fire the other Liz unless she's in the bottom 10%.
 Ugh, you can just tell she is by her stupid face! You're a better person than this.
 Jack has given me absolute power.
 I am the decider.
 Okay, you can't just do this.
 I'm not gonna just do anything.
 I have a plan.
 Step one, befriend the enemy and gather information.
 Then use the information to drive her into the bottom 10%.
 Good Lordyour eyes.
 You look like that lady astronaut who tried to kidnap that other woman.
 Hey, that was a lady with a plan.
 Diapers, Mace, Houston to Orlando in nine hours? Blammo.
 I know I'm the guy who lied to his wife about having a vasectomy, but this this is wrong.
 No, it's not wrong! I'm just staying the course, and I'm enjoying it.
 Jack is out of my hair, people are being nice to me.
 There's a guy I like in the building, and I have the authority to fire his girlfriend? For the first time ever, things are lining up for old Liz Lemon.
 Stop! Stop it! Jack, come on.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, your assistant's been looking for you.
 Oh, thank you very much, Kenneth.
 Uh, Eddie and I have just been making up for some lost time.
 Hey, Jack, uh, you mind if I take a few grapes for dinner later? Why don't you just take the money? No.
 If you wanna give money to someone, you give it to those nurses who took care of Dad at Chicago All Saints Hospital.
 They never once said anything about the racist stuff towards the end.
 All right, I'll have my assistant write a check.
 Help yourself to some grapes.
 But you had to go to the bathroom, so Dad missed seeing Meredith Vieira! Now I'm pissed! Not one of you kids is ever gonna amount to anything.
 That's why your mom left.
 Yeah.
 Maybe we should get all the Donaghy kids back together again.
 Aw, Jack, they don't wanna see me.
 Oh, come on, we're Irish.
 We're a forgiving people.
 Aww! I'm so glad you asked.
 Kabbalah is a wonderful religion that mixes the fun part of Judaism with magic.
 So where do you worship? Where don't you worship? My friend, Madonna Hey, Jack's brother.
 What religion are you? This one sounds really expensive and gay.
 Oh, well, uh, I'm Irish Catholic.
 Now, I know there's been a lot of controversy around the church lately.
 You know, because of The Da Vinci Code.
 But what's great is you can do anything, anything, and as long as you go to confession, it's forgiven.
 I'm Irish Catholic.
 Well, well, other Liz.
 Played saxophone in the marching band at Rutgers? Kept that a secret from your employer, didn't you? Excuse me, Liz.
 Jack said it'd be okay if I put this here.
 It's, uh, for the hospital that took care of my dad.
 Oh, yeah--I'm so glad to see you and Jack getting along.
 Uh, absolutely, we-- we'll give money, right? You want us to give money? I'd be happy to.
 Heart of gold, L.
L.
 Is there a limit to how much we can give? I hope not.
 Let's get our checkbooks! Yeah! Wow.
 I bet Pops is looking down right now and saying, "If I could come back and do any broad, it'd be that one right there.
" Ew.
 So Pop says, "What does it look like I'm doing right now?" So they ended up landing in Dallas for six hours and it was on the news! It was not on the news, you're such a liar.
 Excuse me, everybody, this is Kenneth.
 Kenneth, this is my family.
 That's Patrick, this is Patricia, this is Katherine Catherine, and her husband Bobby, and this is, uh, Margaret.
 We just found out about her today.
 Oh, uh, welcome! Kenneth's going to take you all downstairs to the studio.
 I would like to make a toast to Pop.
 Well, we've been toasting Pop for over an hour now.
 Maybe we should pace ourselves.
 You know what, why don't you stop trying to control everything, Jack? He was a wonderful father.
 He was always ready with a joke.
 Or rum balls in his pockets for the kids.
 Eddie? Come here, you magnificent douche bag! Eddie! How the hell are ya? Have a drink.
 Uh, actually I've been clean and sober for seven months.
 Stop showing off and have a drink.
 Sure.
 Hey, Liz.
 Oh, hey, Liz.
 Right, so I'm doing these quick performance reviews.
 I'm gonna be doing them with everybody every six months or so, so, um, are you settling in okay? Yeah, everyone's been great.
 Learning where stuff is.
 What would you say are your weaknesses? Some people say I'm too nice.
 Where do you see yourself in five years? Well, hopefully, I'll still be working for G.
E.
 It's a great company for working moms.
 What? You know, in five years.
 In--I mean, I'm in a relationship right now.
 By then I'll probably have a couple of kids, be living in the suburbs-- just having it all, really.
 You're fired! I'm the decider! Uh God, I missed you guys.
 It's too bad it took Dad dying to get us all together again.
 He was always bringing people together.
 He was just like Lady Di.
 He was.
 This is Margaret.
 Boy, she's really got Mom's smile, doesn't she? Yeah.
 To Pop! The sorriest bastard that ever walked the earth.
 Don't say that about my daddy! Oh, Patricia, you're embarrassing yourself.
 Yeah, well, you don't say that about my father, Mrs.
! What do you say Good posture, who cares? Uh, what do you say we all head downstairs right now before this takes the traditional Donaghy turn for the worse.
 Seriously, don't even start with me! Don't start with me, Mrs.
! You did it, you fired her? Uh-huh.
 You cant' do that, Liz! I'm gonna tell human resources! No, no, you're not! You're fired! Did you just fire Pete? Yes! I'm gonna put his name on a list! And everything! Can I help you? Ms.
 Lemon, the, uh, accounting department wishes to protest the firing of our colleague.
 Now, we have discussed it-- You're fired! You're all fired! Clean out your desks! Fired! Lemon, the purpose of these cuts is to make us more efficient so we make more money.
 And the people who tell me if I'm making more money are called accountants.
 And if I don't have any accountants-- No, Jack, you would be proud of me.
 It's all part of a plan.
 It just got out of control.
 A plan to do what? Things were really lining up for old Liz Lemon.
 And this other Liz, this accountant girl, was just getting in the way of my happiness.
 Your happiness? Lemon, is this about a boy? Mm-hmm.
 Good God in heaven.
 Who is he? What's his name? Flower guy? Lemon, you've gone chicken killer on me over a guy whose name you don't know? And you still think our next President should be a woman? He just seems like a really cool guy, and I think he likes me more than her.
 That'svery sad.
 It really is, isn't it? I'm gonna go talk to some food about this.
 Oh, Liz, did you put your check in already? Oh, no.
 Who do I make it out to? Chicago All Saints Hospital? Eddie just said to write the initials on the check.
 C A S H.
 Son of a bitch.
 Eddie already took the other box.
 Son.
 Dad? Your brother Eddie's dead.
 He wanted you to have his watch.
 Eddie.
 You.
 Me? You! What are you doing here? What do you think? I'm pulling the Dead Man's Curve on Jack.
 When we parted ways, we agreed that I would get Jack and you would do the thing in Sacramento! You are both a disgrace to the Donaghy name! It's pronounced Dona-fee, you lace curtain half-an-Englishman! When I think of all the things that I've been holding inside me that I wanted to say to you Well, now I'm gonna let St.
 Patrick and St.
 Michael do my talking for me! You'll have to get through Tip O'Neill and Bobby Sands first! You call those fist names? Say hello to Bono and Sandra Day O'Connor! Those are the stupidest fist names I've ever heard.
 Daddy's not dead! Eddie, you lying sack of crap! Jack Donaghy, you don't raise your fists to my dead father! Bobby, give me my keys.
 Let's go! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Yeah, what--what are you doing? You can't fight in front of my audience! What, do you think you're better than me? Lemon, are you okay? I want youto punch your sister in the face.
 It's on.
 I call same sides as the bicentennial brawl! I was impressed by how you take a punch, Lemon.
 I played dead for the worst of it, but it didn't fool your family.
 It sure didn't.
 The whole thing was strangely reassuring, though.
 To know that they'll be there after I'm dead, fighting over my corpse before it's cryogenically frozen.
 Where's Eddie now? I gave him and my dad a three-day head start out of love and sportsmanship.
 Hmm.
 As always, it's been a pleasure fighting with you.
 Oh, I had to rehire that Liz Lemler that you fired.
 Okay.
 And I didn't want any more trouble with her, so I had to give her a promotion too.
 Fantastic.
 It's an amazing opportunity for her out at, uh, corporate headquarters.
 In Connecticut? She's transferred to Connecticut? Yes.
 That's right.
 It seems that things are lining up once again for old Liz Lemon.
 And you say? Thank you, Jack.
 You're welcome.
 I hear your girlfriend got transferred.
 Sorry.
 Yeah.
 I guess it wasn't meant to be.
 Liz! You forgot to give me the key to your place, and I need it, my wife knows about our little secret.
 I don't know how she found out.
 Oh, God.
 I should've just gotten a vasectomy! Let me explain.
 Hey, did you hear the good news, J.
 D.
? I'm IrisCatholic now.
 Like you, Regis, and the Pope.
 Oh, no, you're not.
 The church already has enough lawsuits.
 See, I could screw up now, and then just go to confession.
 No longer do I have to throw my parties in international waters.
 That's not how it works, Tracy.
 Even though there is the whole confession thing, that's no free pass.
 Because there is a crushing guilt that comes with being a Catholic.
 Whether things are good, or bad, or you're simply eating tacos in the park.
 There is always the crushing guilt.
 I don't think I want that.
 I'm out.
 Somehow I feel oddly guilty about that.
 I don't want nothing crushing me.
   

                




                    			Hey.
 Hey.
 Wow.
 Hot dog times, huh? I only eat them on special occasions.
 What's the special occasion? I decided to eat one.
 Fair enough.
 You going this way? Uh, no, I'm going in here, actually.
 I'll see you later.
 Okay, bye.
 Church on a Tuesday? But he seemed so normal.
 I know, right? And, uh, this is Kenneth, one of our pages.
 Kenneth, this is Devin Banks, our Vice President of West Coast News, Web Content and Theme Park Talent Relations.
 Hey, Devin, you better watch out, Kenneth might take your job one day.
 Or your job, Jack.
 Or his job! Why don't we just, uh-- Devin.
 Yeah.
 Morning.
 My notes.
 Ugh, dude, how can we be wearing the same outfit? You saw me leave the apartment this morning.
 I saw you put it on and I thought it looked nice.
 How long are you staying with me? Indefinitely.
 Huh.
 Liz, I want you to meet Devin Banks.
 He's in from L.
A.
 Devin, this is Lemon.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 Love the show.
 Thank you.
 Look, I gotta go.
 Thanks for the tour.
 You guys you're the real heroes.
 They get younger every year.
 These punks who think they can take down Jack Donaghy.
 You're worried about that guy? Banks is in New York for a reason, and I intend to send him back to L.
A.
 Wow, if this turns into a showdown, you guys could settle it with a talking like this contest.
 Banks is no slouch.
 He pioneered the concept of ten second internet sitcoms.
 * Making it happen Honey, I'm home.
 Oh, great.
 * We made it I'm sure he's here to dazzle the old men with his webisode ideas, but I have ideas too, Lemon.
 Like what? Something big.
 A live television special with fireworks.
 They can do shapes now.
 One time, I saw a cowboy hat.
 Boom, boom, boom.
 Boy, you're gonna need more than that though.
 Maybe you're right.
 I want you on this, Lemon.
 Those jokes you wrote for my Mitt Romney fundraiser, they were top-notch.
 Those weren't jokes.
 That was an appeal for a return to common sense and decency.
 Well, it got big laughs.
 Yeah, we should do a sketch about alien abductions.
 Yeah.
 Like a Lamaze class in Roswell.
 Lamazewell.
 Dude, what's with the ridiculous hat and glasses? I'm incognito.
 Some dude is trying to slap me with a subpoena for a paternity suit.
 But the kid ain't mine.
 How do you know it's not your child? 'Cause I remember that girl and it's impossible.
 I never got out of my car and she never got all the way out of her tollbooth! Okay.
 Let's get back to work, guys.
 How about a sketch about Bill Clinton eating hamburgers? That stinks.
 What is this, 1992? Eh, what do you want from me? I'm not a comedy writer.
 Wha--? Mr.
 Jordan you've been served.
 You know, the more I think about it, the more jazzed I'm getting about these fireworks.
 Maybe don't pitch the fireworks thing right away.
 I'm gonna come up with a couple other things I think you'll like better.
 Well, what I'm saying is, that is what we're selling at the pitch meeting, Lemon: spectacle.
 It's what people want.
 The Romans knew it.
 Louis XIV knew it.
 Wolfowitz knows it.
 Mr.
 Donaghy.
 As instructed, I was spying on Mr.
 Banks.
 And there's something you should know.
 So what team do you play for? Oh, it's not really a team.
 It's just a bunch of guys who like doing gymnastics.
 You know I'm gonna be in town for a little while.
 Maybe we could get together.
 My, you're friendly! Good God.
 Devin is gay.
 He's even more powerful than I thought.
 Maybe you should seduce him and get him to tell you all his secret plans.
 So Mr.
 Donaghy, what can I do for you? I heard you were talking with my colleague Devin Banks.
 Did he tell you why he was in New York? No, sir, we just talked about Anderson Cooper mostly.
 You should get to know Devin.
 Tell him all of your television ideas.
 You know, he started off as a page just like you.
 Really? So did I! You say the right things, ask him the right questions, I'm sure he could open some doors for you.
 Okay.
 What kinds of questions? I'll write them down for you.
 You call him, tell him you got two tickets for A Chorus Line for tonight.
 And, uhKenneth Have you ever used bronzer? Dr.
 Spaceman, when they check my DNA, will they tell me what diseases I might get or help me to remember my ATM pin code? Absolutely.
 Science is whatever we want it to be.
 I'll let you know as soon as I have the results.
 I already know the results.
 The kid is not mine.
 Boy, it's crazy to think we used to settle questions of paternity by dunking a woman in water until she admitted she made it all up.
 Mmdifferent time, the '60s.
 But he was going to church in the middle of the day on a Tuesday.
 What do you think that means? It means he probably murdered someone and found God while he was in jail.
 Maybe he's born-again? Ugh, boy.
 We'll spend our Saturdays in Central Park trying to "save" gay rollerbladers.
 I just wish people would tell you immediately when you meet them, "Hi, I am so and so.
 Here's all the weird stuff about me.
" Ah, that would never work.
 If I told my wife in college, "Hey, I'm gonna lose all this beautiful hair and fart in my sleep for the next 20 years," she never would have married me.
 Love is like an onion, and you peel away layer after stinky layer until you're just weeping over the sink.
 Is that my sweatshirt? Hey! Ohsorry.
 No, no-- Ugh! And I have an idea for a show about a teacher named Art.
 I call that one "Art School.
" And one about a Jewish guy who opens an ice cream parlor.
 That one's called "Ice Cream Cohen.
" And a drama about two cops, one named Cash and one named Carry.
 I don't have a title for that one.
 But then also-- Kenneth.
 Can I offer you a libation? I have champagne, vodka, absinthe-- Fruit punch, please.
 Right.
 You'll excuse me.
 I'll go slip into something a little more comfortable.
 Like in the movies! So Mr.
 Banks what brings you to New York? Oh, just making the rounds.
 Hmm.
 What projects are you working on near-slash-long term? Oh my.
 That's an awful short robe.
 I know.
 I had to cut it down myself.
 Oh, Kenneth.
 You know, I was a page.
 And when I was in the program, we'd give each other a hand.
 Can you give me a hand, Kenneth? For a fellow page, anything! Great.
 Tell me about Jack Donaghy.
 Tracy, I have the results of your DNA test.
 Now, I'm very serious about doctor/patient confidentiality so I'm gonna have to ask at all four of us keep this to ourselves.
 What's the verdict, Doc? Good news.
 You are not the father of that child.
 Yeah! However, according to my DNA database, you are a direct descendant of our third president.
 Jasper Buceman? No, Tracy.
 Our third president.
 Thomas Jefferson.
 Jefferson? Not possible.
 Yeah, that's a white dude.
 Yeah, but that guy was into black chicks.
 I'm surprised I am not a descendant.
 These DNA results show that genetically you're mostly white.
 That ridiculous.
 I can't be white.
 My whole persona is based on an in-depth analysis of the differences between black and white.
 This is how black people dial a phone.
 * Boop ood a-boop a-doop a-doop whoop * This is how white people dial a phone.
 I gotta call my wife.
 Devin.
 What can I do for you? I think we're way past that, Jack.
 Let's be honest with each other.
 I'll go first.
 I'm gay and I want your job.
 Devin, I'm straighter than you are gay and I leave particles of guys like you in my wind.
 I'm not afraid of you.
 Yeah, well, you should be.
 Lets just see how little shakes out in the meeting.
 Yeah let's.
 Oh, by the way, a little slim-waisted birdie in a page jacket told me you got nothing.
 You're going down.
 No, Devin.
 I don't do that.
 No, no, no.
 Are you kidding me? You eat too many hot dogs.
 Please, I am concerned.
 I copied this article on sodium for you.
 Fine.
 But I will be reporting this to the Fox Problem Solvers.
 Oh, boy.
 What is this, Bible study? Excuse me one second.
 Hey.
 Hi.
 I didn't know you came here.
 Oh, well, I haven't been in a super long time.
 But, yeah, my parents used to make me go every week.
 Wow.
 Well, welcome back.
 Thanks.
 You're doing the right thing.
 Go ahead, have a seat.
 Okay, everybody.
 Let's get started.
 Hi, my name is Floyd and I'm an alcoholic.
 Hi, Floyd.
 Hi, Floyd.
 Uh It's been four years since my last drink.
 But I just broke up with my girlfriend, so I guess today I'll be talking about my issues with women and trust.
 The dishonesty that my dad You stayed? Pete, you don't understand.
 He was pouring his guts out.
 It was like eavesdropping on somebody else's therapy.
 It was great.
 Yeah, that's not okay.
 But I just feel like I've known him forever now, you know? I mean, his father was awful.
 Awful.
 And he told this story about trying to make French toast for his mom when he was a kid and he started crying! I love him.
 Liz, what is your plan here? What are you gonna do? You're gonna fake being an alcoholic for the rest of your life? I don't know, okay? One day at a time, Pete.
 I'm gonna take it one day at a time.
 I want you to tell me everything that happened last night.
 The curtains open on a group of chorus line dreamers in 1970s leotards-- Five, x-- Stop that.
 I'm not talking about the show.
 The only reason I sent you to Banks was to get information.
 Why were you telling him anything? I'm sorry, sir.
 I had to keep talking just to stop him from putting his fingers in my mouth.
 Kenneth, you are the worst gay bait ever.
 You used me? For television.
 Kenneth, I humiliated you for television.
 Like on What's Happening when that man used Rerun to bootleg that Doobie Brothers concert! Exactly.
 And I need to humiliate you again.
 I got a very important meeting coming up and Banks cannot be there.
 And you want me to kill him.
 No.
 I need you to distract him.
 You gotta make sure he doesn't leave that hotel room tomorrow morning.
 I'll do it.
 Just like Sidney Bristow on Alias, I'll use my sexuality as a weapon.
 To the wig shop! Psst, Lemon! Lemon, it's on.
 Banks is gunning for me.
 Yeah, I've been working on it all week.
 I don't know what happened in your life that cause you to develop a sense of humor as a coping mechanism.
 Maybe it was some sort of brace or corrective boot you wore during childhood.
 But in any case, I'm glad you're on my team.
 Ah.
 I can't do this sketch! What? Why? Because you can't have a white dude playing a criminal.
 That's a negative portrayal of my people! Tracy, you're not white.
 I don't know who I am anymore! There's been a black man inside of me for a long time, now there's a white guy up in here too.
 It's like the audience for a Bobby McFerrin concert up in here! Tracy, you should be honored to be a descendant of Thomas Jefferson.
 Of course you would say that.
 You wish you were white.
 Wh--how dare you? I happen to know what it means to be proud of one's heritage.
 My great-great-great grandfather was one of the few black men who had achieved an officer's rank during the Civil War.
 This is a picture of him shaking hands with Ulysses S.
 Grant.
 Yeah, let me check that out.
 I think he's shaking hands with Robert E.
 Lee.
 Dude, your relative fought for the South.
 You're related to a black Confederate officer.
 That's messed up.
 See? Now you know what I'm going through.
 Do you think these other black guys are his prisoners or what? Maybe Jack's special could be based on a holiday.
 What's left in April? Arbor Day, the Boston Marathon and Hitler's birthday.
 Soyou got options.
 Hey, Liz? Hi.
 Hi.
 Hey.
 Could I-- can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah.
 All right.
 I'm sorry to do this at work, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
 You weren't at the meeting today.
 Oh! No, I'm okay.
 Okay, good.
 I just wanna offer my support.
 If you ever need to talk to someone, I'd be more than happy to take you out for coffee.
 [silently] No.
 Do you have time now? Sure.
 Okay.
 Oh.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 All right, Tracy.
 I have the DNA results right here.
 Are you ready to find out who your biological father is? I think I am.
 Tracy Meet your father, Tom.
 No! I hate you, Thomas Jefferson! I don't know who I am anymore! Hey, Maury, he a dog.
 He a dog.
 Sally Hemings just called you a dog, Thomas Jefferson.
 No matter, Maurence.
 I'm here for you, Tracy Jordan.
 I rode a horse all the way from heaven to tell you something important.
 America, which I invented which I invented, is a great country because we are not burdened by our pasts.
 Embrace who you are, Tracy Jordan.
 And may the Force be with you always.
 I have never seen so much come out of one pigeon! Yeah, I think it might've been sick.
 Or maybe the little guy ate a cigarette or something.
 Hey, do you wanna come over? My friend Pete is staying with me and we've decided that we're gonna do this thing where every night we watch one of the AFI top 100 movies.
 How many have you gone through? Well, I only have Star Wars and Tootsie, so we just keeping watching those two over and over.
 I'm in.
 But only 'cause your friend's there.
 Otherwise it would be too tempting for this to turn into aa real date.
 What do you mean? Well Obviously, since we're in the same group, we can never date.
 It's against the rules.
 Right, but isn't that one of those rules like, "don't walk between the subway cars," and all the cool people just do it anyway? Liz, I need the rules.
 The last time I drank I ended up doing a man-on-the street commercial for Tarzan on Ice.
 It was awesome! I mean, he was swinging on his skates! And the little monkey was funny.
 I wanna see it again! Yikes.
 Yeah.
 And I didn't even see it.
 So all the rules.
 Yeah.
 But I'll buy the popcorn.
 Karate! Karate! Karate! Kenneth, what are you doing here? Well, I was in the neighborhood.
 Hmm.
 Do you want me to dance for you? Yeah.
 That's the business.
 Oh, man.
 Yeah.
 This is traffic on the twos.
 Top deck of the G.
W.
 Bridge (Devin) Yeah.
 Touch your belt buckle.
 Oh, touch the peacock.
 Construction on the Merritt causing slowdowns.
 Oh, you're a peacock.
 The time is now 7:52.
 You warlock! You came to entrance me.
 Donaghy sent you.
 Where the hell is Lemon? I can't find her.
 Hey.
 Oh, hey.
 Good morning.
 Good morning.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 I guess I kinda fell asleep on your legs.
 I know.
 It's weird.
 I've never let anybody put their head that close to my feet before.
 Um, do you want some coffee? Aaagh.
 Oh boy.
 Pins and needles.
 Are you all right? Aah! Both my legs are asleep.
 Okay, all right.
 Here we go.
 Come on.
 Hop up.
 Here we go.
 All right? Walk it off, scarecrow.
 That was really fun last night.
 I, uh I think Tootsie's a very well-crafted movie.
 Yeah, they use it as an example in all the screenplay books.
 Oh.
 Look I would really love to do this again sometime, but I You know, I don't think it's a good idea.
 Bye.
 I-- Floyd, I'm not an alcoholic.
 I lied.
 I followed you to that church because I have a crush on you and I let you think that I belonged there.
 What? I know.
 I know it makes me seem just nut-log Ann Heche crazy, but if there's any way that you could see past it-- No! No, that-- I said stuff in there that even my best friends don't know.
 I know.
 That's supposed to be a safe place! I know.
 It is extremely not okay that you did that! What are you still doing here? Don't you have a breakfast meeting with Jack? Oh, oh! Floyd, I'm sorry.
 I have to go.
 No, no, no.
 No, I'm--I'm going.
 I feel more confused and betrayed than those people that worked with Tootsie.
 Bear with me.
 Sorry.
 Gentlemen, lady, if Jack's not ready, I'd like to tell you about the future of entertainment.
 What am I talking about? Celebrity snuff.
 Reality content.
 Made exclusively for your mobile phone.
 Now, what's that? MC Lyte just murdered Danny Bonaduce? Oh, thanks, phone! Or fireworks.
 What? Banks here wants to make TV smaller.
 But broadcast television is big.
 It's about spectacle.
 The kinds of shows we watched as kids sitting on our neighbor's knee.
 Inaugurations, the Super Bowl, the Oscars.
 That's why we got into television in the first place.
 That's why I give you The Rockefeller Center Salute to Fireworks! Can you get those fireworks that look like cowboy hats? You sure can.
 Thank you so much.
 I appreciate your patience.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, Liz Lemon is on the phone.
 Don't bother coming in, Lemon.
 You're off the project.
 I'll do it without you.
 Jack, I'm so sorry.
 It's just, you know, I told you about the Flower Guy and-- I don't have time for this.
 You've made your priorities clear.
 I hope he's worth it.
 I found a biography on your ancestor.
 It's called, Confederate Monster: The Tobias Spurlock Disaster.
 Yo, Toof, how you doing? Not good.
 The barn that John Wilkes Booth hid in belonged to Tobias Spurlock.
 Well, listen.
 Dream Jefferson told me some amazing stuff.
 He said it's not about who you were, it's about who you are right now.
 No, Toofer.
 Give in to your heritage.
 Kill Tracy.
 Let me shoot something at you.
 I came up with a movie idea about all of this.
 And I want you to write it.
 Okay, what's the movie? It's the story of Thomas Jefferson, only thing we're gonna do it like Norbit, where I play all the parts.
 That's actually hilarious.
 It's not a comedy.
 It's a drama.
 Oh.
 Hium I'm really sorry about what I did, and I know that you can't forgive me.
 But just to even things out here's all of my weird secret stuff.
 I have been sexually rejected by not one, but two guys who later went to Clown College.
 I get super nervous whenever I hear a vacuum cleaner because when I was a kid, my mom used to turn on the vacuum to drown out the sound of her and my dad fighting.
 Which is why I rarely vacuum my apartment.
 Likenever.
 I have had three donuts so far today.
 Uh, once in college, I pooped my pants a little bit at a Country Steaks all-you-can-eat buffet, and I didn't leave until I finished my second plate of shrimp.
 A couple months of ago I went on a date with my cousin.
 Wow, I-- I am a mess.
 There is an 80% chance in the next election that I will tell all my friends I am voting for Barack Obama, but I will secretly vote for John McCain.
 Here's one, um when I was a kid, I used to put on my fanciest nightgown and then I would mix orange soda and cream soda in a champagne glass and I would sit in the dark and watch The Love Boat.
 Consequently, I have some weird sexual fantasy stuff about Gopher from The Love Boat.
 And Ilied.
 I have had five donuts today.
 So, umthat's my deal.
 Now we're even.
 Liz.
 You know, the Roomba is a nice, quiet alternative to a vacuum.
 Thank you, that's uh that's a good tip.
 And in the interest of full disclosure, I also have a sexual fantasy about Gopher.
 Except mine's the one from Caddyshack.
 Well, that makes sense 'cause he's a very good dancer.
 * Sky rockets in flight * Afternoon at night Oh, boy.
 I really should've been at that meeting.
 Welcome to the Rockefeller Center Salute to Fireworks! Now without further ado, three hours of fireworks! Wait, fireworks? In Midtown? On a day that is not the Fourth of July? Oh, my God.
 Oh, boy.
 That's gonna scare a lot of people.
 Sir, the Mayor.
 Shut it down! Shut it down! Oh, boy.
 Oh, the cowboy hat.
   

                




                    			Hey, what's wrong with you? What? Your face-- it's like you're happy or something.
 I am happy, Frank.
 'Cause of that dude you're donking.
 Floyd? Yes.
 He just gets me.
 I think you've got a little something-- Right here? Other side.
 Here? Up a little.
 In that area? You got it.
 Ugh, that movie was a complete waste of time.
 I thought it was moving my bowels.
 Reverse, reverse, skip, skip, draw four! Oh, hell no! Ha ha! That's awesome, Liz.
 I'm really happy that you found someone to care about.
 Because relationships are hard.
 So if you ever need someone to come over and videotape you guys doing it, or whatever, I can make room in my schedule.
 Thanks, Frank.
 You're welcome.
 No judgments.
 Don.
 Jack, you old dog, how are you? I'm good, sir.
 Of course you are.
 Look at those eyes, sharp, like a panther's.
 Thank you, sir-- would you like to sit down? I can't.
 I took my grandkids snorkeling at St.
 Bart's, and got stung by a jellyfish.
 I got a welt on my ass the size of a Red Delicious apple.
 I'm very sorry to hear that, sir.
 Yeah.
 Boy, Jack you really terrified the people with that fireworks special of yours.
 Well, we were trying for something dramatic, and I don't regret trying.
 Well, you gotta try.
 As my old man always said, If you try, you win.
 And he was a hell of a garbage man.
 I just want you to know we all still have a lot of faith in you, Jack.
 Well, thank you, sir.
 That means the world coming from you.
 But I'm taking the microwave division away from you.
 I mean, you're in the rough, Jack.
 You gotta get back on the fairway.
 Yes, sir.
 You ever think about getting remarried? Well, I just got divorced, sir.
 Everyone in this division is married except you.
 Look at Bob.
 His wife looks just like Walter Matthau, but she's always there for him.
 That's the kind of companion you need.
 Think about that.
 I will, sir.
 I'm going to see Tracy Jordan.
 He is funny.
 What's that film where he turned into a dog? Uh, Fat Bitch, sir.
 That's it-- I love it.
 Boy, that's a great film.
 I'm sorry I let you down.
 Thank you for agreeing to meet with me, Don Geiss.
 Would you like some Grenadine or some fried rice? I'm good, thanks.
 Sir, I have a movie project that is going to blow your mind.
 I call it Jefferson.
 A movie version of The Jeffersons? I love it.
 No, Thomas Jefferson.
 I just recently found out that he went to town on one of my ancestors, so we're related.
 You want to play Thomas Jefferson? And Sally Hemings, and King George.
 I'm going to play all the parts.
 Did you know he had a lisp? Whath's up, sthupid jerks? I'm Thomas Jefferthon.
 So we're gonna need about 35 million to do this thing right.
 I'm gonna get us one of those big clocks.
 We could hang it in there.
 Sorry I'm late.
 Aw, Lutz, that's okay.
 I'm just glad you're here.
 Oh, you've got a face like a baby's bottom! Boop.
 I hate when you're in a good mood.
 It makes me feel unsafe.
 Like when my mom used to make daiquiris and sing Tanya Tucker songs.
 That sounds awesome.
 Miss Lemon, Mr.
 Donaghy would like to see you.
 He's across the street at Christie's auction house.
 Oh, brother.
 What's this? Jack goes to Sbarro when he's angry, the New York Stock Exchange when he's horny, and Christie's auction house when he's depressed.
 He said he needs you immediately.
 Yeah that's the Liz face I'm comfortable with.
 You've been avoiding me, Lemon.
 How do you do that without turning around? To be perfectly honest, the first couple of people I did that to were not you.
 But here we are.
 Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Hi, you probably don't remember me.
 I'm Phoebe.
 I handled the sale of your ex-wife's jewelry to an anonymous Arab.
 Oh, yes, of course.
 Those were such lovely pieces.
 The ruby and diamond cluster ring was particularly exquisite.
 That was her engagement ring.
 You know, I took the money from the sale of those pieces, and I bought a sailboat, and I named it after my ex-wife, and I sank it.
 It's true.
 The Bianca Blows is somewhere at the bottom of the Peconic Bay.
 If there's anything I can show you, please do let me know.
 Okay? Yeah.
 I really do like these equestrian paintings.
 Isn't that magnificent? Sometimes I wish I were a horse.
 Strong, free.
 My chestnut haunches glistening in the sun.
 Are you okay? Hmm? Oh, yeah, sure.
 You know, I'm really sorry that I let you down.
 You should be.
 My special was a disaster.
 I wouldn't say that.
 You left me dangling, Lemon.
 I'm not a creative type like you, with your work sneakers and your left-handedness.
 I can't do what you do.
 I know, I dropped the ball.
 I was just trying to do what you said, and have a personal life.
 And I guess I got caught up with this new guy.
 Oh, right, flower guy.
 His name is Floyd.
 That's unfortunate.
 I'd really like you to meet him, Jack.
 Fine.
 I'd like to meet the man that made Liz Lemon shirk her responsibilities.
 Let's say Persil, 9:00.
 Be sure to wear a tie.
 Are you sure you're okay? I pitched my Jefferson movie to Don Geiss.
 He said no.
 He said people only see movies because of the previews, and he couldn't visualize my Jefferson preview.
 He wants me to do Fat Bitch 2 instead.
 Well, that doesn't even make sense.
 Everyone knows Fat Bitch died at the end.
 It's not the kind of stuff I want to do anymore, Ken.
 I want to be taken seriously.
 What should I do? Well, remember when Fat Bitch called all her dog friends together, and they used their high-pitched howling to mess up the-- You're right, K.
 I should make my own Jefferson preview, and show it to Don Geiss.
 I'm never gonna finish this bikini before Nana's birthday.
 Hey, Liz Lemon, where you going? Uh, home.
 I gotta go get ready for a dinner with Jack.
 Listen, I'm gonna need to make a fake trailer for my Jefferson film.
 I'm gonna need the entire resources of the show for no more than three weeks.
 You in? No-what? No.
 Tracy, you're not doing that.
 We have a show on Friday.
 Liz Lemon, you are my Alexander Hamilton.
 I don't know what that means.
 Writers, listen.
 I need your help.
 Well, I hope this isn't too boring for you.
 Are you kidding? Jack Donaghy's a legend.
 I've read his book, like, 20 times.
 Jack wrote a book? Yeah.
 Jack Attack: The Art of Aggression in Business.
 Oh, no.
 He got here before us.
 You're not supposed to let that happen.
 That's chapter two in the book.
 Hi, Jack.
 This is Floyd.
 It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
 Well, you're Floyd.
 The only other Floyd I ever knew was this Korean barber who used to cut my hair down in the 50th Street subway station.
 That's my dad.
 I'm Floyd, Jr.
 I-I'm just kidding.
 Well, please.
 Sorry.
 I'm just nervous to meet the head of east coast television and microwave oven programming.
 I just got the word from Geiss they're taking me off microwave.
 Oh, no.
 Really? Mr.
 Donaghy, with all due respect to Mr.
 Geiss, I gotta say he's making a terrible mistake.
 This company's stability in the small-appliance market is in large part your doing.
 The dedicated popcorn setting on your microwave was the imagination breakthrough of 1995.
 In 2002, you increased corporate earnings by 3%, while the country suffered through a recession.
 And Attack of the Clones, which was seriously the worst of the Star Wars-- One sec, Liz, one sec.
 And on a personal note, sir, in my mind, the Foo Fighters' song Best of You is about your managerial skills.
 Lemon, I want to kiss your boyfriend on the mouth.
 Chapter 12.
 I thought you were gonna do it.
 What are you drinking? Club soda.
 Oh, that's a shame.
 Pete! Hey, Liz Lemon.
 Could you go away for a while? I gotta get rid of Freddie's erection.
 Explain what is happening here.
 Freddie is playing the part of Thomas Jefferson's horse Caractacus.
 We needed a place to keep him till we shoot his stunts.
 No, Tracy, I told you not to do this.
 Jack said I could.
 This movie is my destiny.
 It's the reason why God put me on this earth.
 I'll take you off this earth.
 The overwhelming violence of the subject matter is in deliberate juxtaposition with the pastoral beauty of the terrain.
 Jack, Tracy put a horse in my office.
 Lemon, you've met-- Hello.
 You probably don't remember me--I'm Phoebe.
 We met the other day.
 Yeah, yeah, I remember you.
 I'm Liz.
 Oh, sorry.
 I don't shake hands.
 I have Avian Bone Syndrome.
 Oh, boy, okay.
 Hollow bones.
 Lemon, I want your opinion.
 Which of these two do you like? They're both beautiful.
 They look just like the one crapping in my office.
 Did you tell Tracy he could use the crew to make a trailer for his crazy movie? Yes.
 How's Floyd? What? he's fine.
 You know, I called him earlier.
 We had a very nice chat-- did he mention that? No, he didn't.
 Oh, he will.
 He's a good man, the Floydster.
 Oh, "the Floydster.
" Don't give him a nickname before I do.
 Umthe white horse.
 I was wondering if-- [whispering] Did I hurt you? Just a little bit, but that's okay.
 Yes, the white horse, it's-- Yo, Trey, we got a problem.
 Pray, who be this Tracy Jordan thou speakest of? Uh, President Jefferson, we got a problem.
 Speakest.
 That horse ate your wig.
 Well, stand guard by his rump, and await it in his droppings.
 Or we could probably just go get a new wig.
 I like you, young man.
 You shall run my university.
 Yeah, yeah.
 No, it's very nice.
 Hey, what are you doing here, Jack? Jack bought me this painting.
 Wow.
 Um Is that lion eating the horse? Or perhaps it's eating universal health care.
 I bought this for the Floydster to congratulate him on his promotion.
 Well, it's not a sure thing.
 I didn't know you were up for a promotion.
 We should go celebrate.
 I'm free for lunch.
 Do you want to grab a burger, or-- Shoot, I just said I'd go to lunch with Jack.
 Oh.
 Why don't you join us? Would that be okay? Yeah, I guess so.
 Sure.
 It's kind of like you two are dating.
 Um, I think that Coulter was right about Edwards.
 So where's Pete? He took his kids to that Russian cat circus.
 Wow.
 You are bringin' it.
 Yeah, you like that? Mmm.
 It's got pockets-- are you into that? Ooh, what's this? A used Kleenex.
 I feel like I'm in a rap video.
 Wait, let me turn on my humidifier.
 Yeah.
 Uh-oh.
 It's so dry in here.
 I really don't know how much more of this I can take.
 Unh, unh Unh, unh.
 Yeah.
 Old school, Kid 'n Play.
 Here we go.
 That's not that impressive.
 That's Davy Jones.
 Hey, it's Jack.
 Jack-- what does he want? He's just saying hi.
 Oh, he wants to meet at that diner on 71st.
 Get a veggie burger and a milkshake.
 You wanna go? It's midnight.
 Yeah, we don't have to go.
 There, done.
 Good, 'cause this VapoRub isn't gonna get under my nose by itself.
 He says goodnight.
 And "sleep tight.
" "And don't let the bed--" All right, enough.
 Gimme that.
 "Jack, I have taken a sleeping pill because I have a big lawyer meeting" That's what we call 'em.
 "in the morning.
 Floyd.
" "Lemon, is that you?" I always sign it Floydster.
 It's Jack! Don't answer it.
 Oh, my God! Can he see us? The call is coming from inside the house! Turn of the lights and get down.
 Jonathan, I want to talk to Jack right now.
 He's at Christie's.
 But he left these for you.
 What's this? Tickets for you and Floyd for tonight's Knicks game.
 For me and Floyd? He tried to drop them off at your house last night, but someone pretended not to be home.
 Oh.
 This is really nice.
 Yes, he seems very taken with Floyd.
 And you, of course.
 Are these good seats? Yeah.
 It's actually a private box.
 Hey, guys.
 Mr.
 Geiss, I know we disagreed on my next movie project, but I hope this willchange I give you this.
 Ah hoe that dirt.
 Put your back into it.
 Mr.
 Jefferson, the British have invaded.
 Ah, bring me my horse! Bring me Caractacus! You come along.
 In a world without hope Who are these Americans with their ridiculous ideas of freedom and equalities? One man would declare his independence for us all.
 Aah! Eat that, King George! I shall call it Susan! I'm with child.
 What? Free me and make me your wife.
 Um, I'll have to get back to you on that.
 Source Award nominee Tracy Jordan Kill them! Kill them all! NAACP Image Award presenter Tracy Jordan and Academy Award watcher Tracy Jordan is This is for you, Don Geiss! Ha ha! Jefferson! Christmas, 2008.
 Get me off this horse.
 Well, Mr.
 Geiss, what do you think? Well, Tracy that was terrible.
 The answer is no.
 Let's talk about Fat Bitch 2.
 So I'm bored, and I sit next to Don Geiss, and I want to make a good impression, so I bought four bottles of absolutely fantastic champagne.
 Lemon, you're gonna love this story.
 You told me this story, Jack.
 We're on our way to Tokyo, we're out over the ocean, and the cabin pressure drops.
 The masks are coming out of the ceiling, and the corks are popping out of the champagne.
 And I don't give a damn about the masks, I'm on all fours trying to shove the corks back in the bottle.
 And Don Geiss says, "Now, there's an executive who knows how to keep his costs down!" That's great.
 I'm gonna get some more crab cakes.
 Liz, you want anything? No, thanks.
 What are you doing?! I'm watching the ballgame with you and the Floydster.
 But don't you kind of feel like a third wheel, Jack? No, Lemon-- you're the third wheel.
 Excuse me? Well, it's really quite simple.
 Men seek out the company of other men they admire and want to be like.
 Floyd is me 20 years ago.
 I'm Don Geiss 30 years ago.
 I'm gonna be Don Geiss, and Don Geiss will be dead.
 Who thinks like that? Men do.
 That's why you're the third wheel.
 Just back off, okay? Lemon, are you telling me to stay away from your boyfriend? Not that I blame you, because I could take him away from you if I wanted to.
 This is my life, Jack.
 I know you're in a bad spot right now.
 But you can't use Floyd to feel better about yourself.
 It's not fair.
 All right, how about some kind of a time-share arrangement? You can have him Monday, Wednesday, and Friday-- I don't want Friday-- we have a show.
 Why am I even having this conversation with you?! Look at your life, Jack.
 It's like this skybox.
 It's fancy and it's empty, and it smells like crab cakes.
 Get your own Floyd, because this one is taken.
 Oh, outstanding.
 Thank you.
 Sir? He said no.
 Then he offered me $7 million to reprise my role as Cocoa the dog.
 * I'm gonna get an iPhone * * Everybody's gonna be jealous * No, I turned him down.
 It's like a roller-coaster ride of emotion in here.
 Look, Thomas Jefferson made his own country.
 I'm gonna make my own movie.
 Finance it myself, all on my terms.
 Now, who's with me? We all are, sir.
 Good, good, good.
 Now, first order of business, get that dead horse out of my car.
 Well, I'm sorry your friend wasn't pleased with the Stubbs.
 Yes, so am I.
 You seem very preoccupied.
 Well, it's just people don't like fireworks anymore.
 Were you aware of that? They took away the microwave division.
 I'm having terrible Lemon problems.
 I'm eating all the time.
 I mean, who needs 16 flautas after midnight? Mr.
 Donaghy Jack.
 Listen, if you're still interested, there is another piece I'd like to show you that you might enjoy.
 I'll need to take you back to the private office.
 This piece is very delicate.
 Very few people have handled it.
 Oh, God, I hope we're talking about the same thing.
 May I speak with you? If this is about the other night, I am not gonna apologize.
 This whole Floyd thing-- No, no, no.
 You're absolutely right.
 I have to make some changes in my life, just like you have.
 Phoebe and I are seeing each other.
 Really? Wow, that's great.
 Now you have a Floydster, and I have a Floydster.
 Well, I don't think Phoebe would appreciate being referred to as a Floydster.
 But you like her? You approve? Of what? Of her for me.
 Yeah, sure.
 Good.
 Hello, I'm Phoebe.
 I don't know if you remember me, but-- Yes, Phoebe, I remember you.
 Hi.
 May I ask you something? Uh, Phoebe, I want you to be my wife.
 Wait, what? Will you marry me? No! The ruby diamond cluster! I bought it back from the anonymous Arab.
 How romantic.
 Ow.
 Ow.
 I'm sorry.
 Okay.
 Ow.
 Careful, my bones.
   

                




                    			And this is the two-bedroom.
 Wow.
 By the hammer of Thor! Can you afford this place? Yeah.
 I can with this new promotion.
 It'sa lot more money.
 Like "get away with murdering my first wife" kind of dough.
 Mm-hmm.
 See, now, I could hang a huge TV right there.
 You could get that third humidifier you always dreamed about.
 Slow down.
 I'm not ready to move my humidifiers yet.
 Oh, I know.
 I don't mean right away.
 I just meantsomeday.
 Hopefully.
 Yeah, good.
 Someday.
 But for now, I got a great job.
 A kick-ass girlfriend.
 I deserve an apartment to match.
 And I think this is definitely it.
 I'll take this one too.
 My son Ahmed will keep his motorcycles here.
 Oh! Thanks for coming.
 Ohooh.
 Lemon! Oh, welcome back.
 How was Paris? Paris was fantastic.
 We stayed in this little place in the Seventh that Phoebe knew about.
 I'm Phoebe.
 We've met before.
 Jack proposed to me outside your office.
 I have hollow bones.
 Like a bird.
 Yes, no.
 I remember you, hi.
 Hi.
 Well, I should go.
 We've just won the auction rights to a fantastic collection of Chinese erotica.
 Pick out a good one for me.
 Careful.
 Bye.
 Sohave you guys set a date? Yes, we have.
 May 18th.
 That's Bianca's wedding date.
 It was my idea.
 That's fast.
 Well, there are no rules in love, Lemon.
 MyPrinceton roommate did it the right way.
 Dated his college girlfriend for 13 years, and the marriage didn't last eight months.
 And now he's a post-op transgender.
 Will you look at that? Phoebe reset my watch to New York time while I was sleeping on the plane.
 She really is a wonderful girl.
 And I do hope the two of you get to know each other better.
 Okay, sure.
 Why don't you have a girls' day out? Take Jenna with you.
 You could have lunch, go shopping.
 Heretake my gold card.
 Ooh, it's heavy.
 It'smade of gold.
 Ah.
 Wow.
 Turned me down, Liz Lemon.
 Who? The damn bank.
 I need a loan to finance my Thomas Jefferson movie.
 It's gonna be at least $30 million with all the Claymation sex scenes in it.
 And they didn't want to pay for that? It's all right.
 The movie's just a small part of my plan.
 What plan? The Tracy Jordan comeback.
 I'm doing a comedy tour, a Michael McDonald cover album.
 Ah, boy, I don't know, Tray.
 I don't think of you as a great multitasker.
 What can I do? I'm on my grind.
 I'm gonna have so much money, my grandkids are gonna play lacrosse.
 Lacrosse, Liz Lemon.
 "I'm on my grind.
" Is that a There he is.
 The Floydster! I heard you were going in for your final interview.
 I wanted to put in a good word.
 All right, well, that should put me over the top.
 Oh, you're already there.
 The other candidate is an outsider.
 And we like to promote from within.
 Plus, his name is Alan Garkel.
 You're never gonna lose a job to a guy named Garkel.
 Did someone say my name? Nah, you're not gonna beat that.
 Well-played, Garkel.
 Because Carl's trying to kill the gophers, but then the explosion knocks Danny's ball into the hole, and he wins the tournament.
 And that is the plot of Caddyshack.
 I can't believe you've never seen it.
 Classic.
 Oh! Jeez, I'm sorry.
 Oh, you like Wagner? No, I like Elmer Fudd.
 Kill da wabbit Kill da wabbit My parents were both poets, so I don't really get it.
 So this has just been a whirlwind romance for you.
 Just awhirl of wind.
 Look, I know what you must be thinking.
 What kind of a woman marries a man she hardly knows? What is she after? No, no, no.
 I don't think that.
 I completely get it, why you would wanna marry Jack.
 I'd marry Jack in a heartbeat.
 I would have a three-way with two Jacks.
 You need to cool it.
 Let's face it-- at our age, we can't afford to waste any time.
 Mm-hmm.
 Floyd and I have been dating for a month.
 Do you think I should be mad that I don't have a ring? Wow, how Sex in the City are we right now? I'm Samantha, you're Charlotte, and you're the lady at home who watches it.
 Dude, check it out.
 Bill Cosby hates you.
 What? Look here.
 "Tracy Jordan has made a career out of exploiting black stereotypes.
 He is an embarrassment to African-Americans.
" Why would he say that? What have I ever done to embarrass black people? Uh Why are we doing this? Because the Jets lost! Mr.
 Jordan, your manager called.
 Temple University has canceled your stand-up appearance.
 And Michael McDonald is denying permission to record any of his songs.
 In other words: Oh, Tracy, you can't Use any of my songs.
 This is no coincidence.
 What are you talking about? The bank loan.
 The Michael McDonald situation.
 Temple University.
 Dr.
 Cosby is sending a message! They're out to destroy me! Who is? The Black Crusaders.
 Oh, Floyd would love this one.
 Yikes! If I was gonna spend $600 to have my boobs pinched, I would have gone to that fundraiser at the Clintons' house.
 Come on, that was solid! Liz, I'm concerned I'm boring Jack sexually.
 No, no.
 Nough.
 We've only just got engaged, and already our intercourse is infrequent and unimaginative.
 Phoebe, I'm really not that kind of girlfriend.
 I would gladly pick you up at the airport.
 In Paris, he fell asleep on top of me.
 I mean, I just want to make him happy.
 If he's happy, I'm happy, you know? Mm.
 Do you have that credit card? Thanks.
 Hi, I'll take everything.
 Liz, can you help me? Yes, ma'am.
 I don't know you, but I will help you.
 Damn it.
 I can't believe it.
 Garkel? I'm sorry.
 I'm just sick of it.
 I'm so tired of this city.
 I am so tired of the rat race.
 Fellas! You gotta keep it down, okay? I got work in the morning.
 Molnya is looking very strong tonight.
 Mr.
 Debarber, come on.
 Fine.
 Yeah, you gotta talk to your landlord about that rat race.
 That is my landlord.
 Oh.
 Yeah.
 Maybe I just need to go out of town for a little while.
 That's a good idea.
 Vermont is always nice.
 Or the Bahamas.
 I was thinking of Cleveland.
 That is also a place.
 I just haven't been home in a long time.
 We need to search your bag.
 Ugh.
 Of course they do.
 You know, I dream about moving back to Lakewood.
 Or maybe even Shaker Heights.
 Big Creek Parkway.
 Sending the kids to St.
 John Bosco's, you know.
 Maybe even cheering on the tribe at the Jake.
 This dream, this is way down the road, right? Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Three, maybe four years.
 What's this fungus cream for? All right, that's it.
 Show's over.
 Gimme that.
 Let's just walk.
 So how long do you see yourself living in New York? Well, like, forever.
 At least, I did.
 Really? You wanna end up like that? No.
 I'm gonna be like her.
 Oh, there is nothing like New York in the spring! It's--oh! Ooh.
 All right, come on.
 This is the capital of the world.
 The culture, the div-- Ugh! Uck! You all right? He spit in my mouth! Ugh! Let's go to Cleveland.
 Oh, blurgh! Hey, Frank told me about that Cosby thing.
 That is harsh.
 Harsh? I'm done.
 The Black Crusaders want to make an example out of me.
 I'm not gonna ask you who that is.
 The Black Crusaders are a secret group of powerful black Americans.
 Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey are the chief majors.
 But Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell, and Gordon from Sesame Street, they're members too.
 And they meet four times a year in the skull of the Statue of Liberty.
 You can read about that on the interweb.
 Ah, well, it must be true if it's on the "interweb.
" Right, uh-huh.
 Make fun of me all you want, Liz Lemon.
 Do you know they'll ruin anybody who they think are making black people look bad? They tanked 50 Cent's movie.
 The blew out Terrell Owens' ankle.
 And they canceled Eddie Murphy's Oscar, 'cause he, uh, ran out on Scary Spice.
 And now they after Tracy Jordan! Tracy, I know the movie is important to you, and you're stressed out and everything, but keep it together, okay? The cleanup continues.
 Fortunately, there were no injuries.
 Tracy Jordan, the Black Crusaders are coming for you.
 We'll have more on the weather coming up Man, I wish somebody else had seen that.
 Hi.
 Look what Phoebe got me.
 Golf clubs? Not just golf clubs.
 These clubs once belonged to President Gerald Ford.
 Oh, wow.
 So what do you think of Phoebe? Oh, well we had fun.
 And, uh, Phoebe bought some bonkers underwear.
 So have fun with that tonight.
 Well, not tonight.
 Uh, may I? Thank you.
 Not tonight unfortunately.
 She's, uh, speaking in a seminar up at Columbia.
 And as much as I would like to attend, I haven't been above 72nd Street in over a decade.
 Well, I'm glad you're happy.
 Ha! It's all Phoebe.
 We have an attraction that can only be described as wolf-like.
 Lupine.
 Okay.
 I am so exhausted.
 Paris was, to borrow a phrase, justbonkers.
 Yes, Phoebe said.
 Do you cover him? Phoebe isn't going to Columbia tonight.
 She had me call a car to take her to this address downtown.
 So what do you want me to do, go spy on her? For Mr.
 Donaghy's sake.
 I know you have your doubts about this.
 I can see it in your eyes.
 It's weird, right? Then again, all relationships are weird.
 I mean, my boyfriend Floyd wants to go to Cleveland.
 Ah, thank God.
 Mr.
 Donaghy's office.
 Just a quick look.
 By the hammer of Thor! Ew.
 Jack, I have to talk to you.
 Is this about the Tracy situation? No.
 Then it'll have to wait.
 What Tracy situation? I tried to call you.
 He set fire to a cardboard cutout of Al Roker, and now he's locked himself in his dressing room.
 Oh, brother.
 Tracy! Come out.
 Nobody is trying to get you.
 Have you seen the cover of this month's Oprah magazine? It's an anagram for "Outlaw Sour Tray.
" Who taught Tracy about anagrams? I'm gonna call Dr.
 Spaceman.
 Hey, car's downstairs.
 You ready to go? Um The Black Crusaders are trying to get rid of me.
 They want me to disappear like Coolio.
 Coolio is around! What-- Would you also prescribe something for Tracy which would keep him awake during sex? Oh, great.
 Okay, I'll talk to you later.
 Thanks.
 Let's get outta here.
 What hot spot's got the hippest groove? Welcome to Cleveland.
 Where all the real gone daddies move What smells so good? Cleveland.
 Where the jet set swing with hepcats Shop at Higby's, then we'll hit the Flats Excuse me.
 Are you a model? No.
 Oh, you are so skinny.
 You really should eat something.
 I say, Cleveland, hello Yeah New York and Paris just don't have The sights you see and you can have Ugh.
 Would you like to pet a real police horse? Chef Boyardee was born here Yes! Oh, ladies first.
 I say Cleveland, hello Hi, I'll have two hotdogs, a pretzel with extra melted cheese Hiya.
 Ms.
 Lemon, this is Kenneth, the NBC page in New York City.
 I hate to bother you out west, but Tracy Jordan hasn't come to work.
 Kenneth, don't be so New York uptight.
 I'm sure he'll show up.
 Look over there, I think I see a movie star Even movie stars, they come to Cleveland To get away Tracy Jordan, you've gotta get away Gotta get away, gotta get away To Cleveland Liz I have something important I wanna talk to you about.
 The top law firm in Cleveland wants me.
 AndI think I should accept.
 What? Really? What's this? It's a house in the Heights that I can afford.
 When did you have time to look for jobs and houses? When you were at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
 Did I tell you I sat in ZZ Top's car? And then I had lunch with Little Richard.
 And, I know it's not TGS, but I'm sure you can find a job at one of the local TV stations.
 You sure could.
 We need a host for a new cooking show on WKYC.
 Uh Where have you been? Cleveland.
 For God sakes, Lemon, we'd all like to flee to the Cleve.
 And club up down at the Flats and have lunch with Little Richard.
 But we fight those urges because we have responsibilities.
 What's going on? Tracy.
 He's missing.
 What? No.
 Kenneth, have you tried to call Tracy? Yes, ma'am, I tried all six of his cell phones.
 It's almost as if he never existed.
 Or maybe he's not answering.
 Lemon, TGS without Tracy Jordan is basically a puppet show.
 You know, I'm right here.
 Oh, why am I doing this when I could be happy living in Cleveland? What? Floyd and I are thinking of moving.
 No, you're not.
 No, you're not.
 Look, every great getaway has that moment when you want to pack it all in and stay.
 That's how I ended up with a timeshare in Port Arthur, Texas.
 I don't think that's what this is.
 I mean, Floyd is pretty great.
 And, look, in Cleveland, I'm a model.
 Yeah, we're all models west of the Allegheny.
 I'm serious about this.
 Maybe you should go.
 I mean, your head is obviously not in the game lately.
 And now you've lost Tracy.
 Maybe you're burned out.
 What is this? This is Frank's "Hot Baby" sketch, which is regrettable, but we have no Tracy Jordan and a show in two days.
 But, hey, that's not gonna be your problem once you move to Ohio.
 No, you're not.
 Frank, that's gonna get cut.
 Blurgh! Did you say anything to Jack? No, but I'm going to if you don't.
 Oh, grow up, Liz.
 I didn't tell Jack where I was going 'cause I didn't want him to get upset about nothing.
 That man was a former lover of mine.
 I was ending it with him, forever.
 Uh-huh, and are all your ex-boyfriends rich, older gentlemen? I care about Jack.
 I make him a better man.
 You know how John Lennon was better than the rest of the Beatles, but didn't realize it until he met Yoko Ono? Well, I'm Jack's Yoko.
 You want to be Yoko? This is none of your business, anyway.
 I'm marrying Jack.
 He's everything I ever wanted.
 Oh, I bet he is.
 You don't know anything about me, so back off! What happened to your accent? Um I don't know what you're on about.
 Youdaft wanker.
 Hello? Hello, Liz Lemon.
 It's me.
 Stacy Gordon.
 Tracy, where are you calling from? I can't tell you that.
 I'm sorry, Liz Lemon.
 I wanna thank you for everything you've done.
 But I quit.
 For God's sakes, Tracy, where are you? Starting a new life.
 Because of the Black Crusaders? That's crazy.
 Tray? Damn it, Lemon, why didn't you tell me the Black Crusaders were after Tracy? Surprisingly fast.
 Oh.
 I'm on it.
 I can't go to Cleveland.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 I'm sorry.
 I just, I've been thinking about this.
 And I think you're great.
 And obviously Cleveland is great.
 But I can't move.
 I know.
 My life is here.
 My friends are here.
 The show is here.
 And I've known you a month.
 Oh, you hate me right now, don't you? No.
 No, it was a crazy idea to begin with.
 We were on a vacation high-- Exactly.
 It's like a drug.
 Right-- if the whole world moved to their favorite vacation spots, then the whole world would live in Hawaii and Italy and Cleveland.
 Totally, I mean But just knowing that C-Town is out there as an option for the future-- it's gonna make it so much easier-- Liz I took that job.
 Blurgh.
 Did you locate Tracy? Ugh, not yet.
 I'm working on it.
 You know, you never answered my question the other day.
 What do you think of Phoebe? Honestly, I wish I had the guts to do what you're doing.
 Justgoing for it.
 God bless.
 You still haven't answered my question.
 Ithink she likes you a lot.
 And I think she takes care of you.
 And she's smart and pretty.
 And completely wrong.
 And she doesn't deserve you.
 I think she's weird, and I don't like her, and her ex-boyfriend is old.
 And I don't even think she's British! And you shouldn't marry her, Jack.
 Please don't marry her! Oh, my God.
 Lemon, Phoebe was right.
 You are infatuated with me.
 What? No! No, no, no.
 Lemon, you are a wonderful woman.
 And you deserve to be as happy as I am.
 Maybe with Floyd, right? No, don't mention Floyd.
 Floyd is not happening.
 Floyd is moving.
 Floyd is moving? What did you do? What did I do? I acted like a rational adult! I didn't get engaged to some gold digger, and then delude myself into thinking that I could keep up with her.
 Yeah, Jack, I know that you fell asleep on top of her in Paris.
 In Paris, France.
 I think you should go.
 Uh, Phoebe, darling, Lemon was just leaving.
   

                




                    			Previously on 30 Rock Oh, garlic.
 Not that.
 Sorry, I don't shake hands.
 I have avian bone syndrome.
 Hollow bones.
 Tracy Jordan, the Black Crusaders are coming for you.
 The top law firm in Cleveland wants me.
 God's sakes, Tracy, where are you? Starting a new life.
 Because of the Black Crusaders? That's crazy.
 Will you marry me? No.
 I took that job.
 Blurgh.
 Where was Kenneth? Let's find out.
 Cough.
 And cough.
 And cough.
 Okay, now let's start the examination.
 Are you getting enough sleep? No.
 You drinking water? No.
 Are u exercising at all? No.
 And you're still working those long hours? Yes.
 I feel great.
 My wedding's in a couple of days.
 Your 18th, right? Same as Bianca's.
 I guess our friends will just have to choose between us.
 My mother's coming up from Florida to attend Bianca's wedding, so it's perfect.
 Do you have any questions about the wedding night? You know, you're actually in better shape than last year.
 You lost a couple pounds, your lab work is good, and your blood pressure is We have a winner.
 How's the stress eating? Under control.
 Still not eating right, huh? No, but I am eating a lot.
 You sound stressed.
 My boyfriend is moving to Cleveland.
 But I'm gonna go visit him over vacation.
 And my boss is super-mad at me because I know that he fell asleep on top of his fiancée.
 Have I given you my new book? It's about having a satisfying love life.
 For life.
 Is that you in these pictures? My techniques guarantee male orgasm.
 And it's the season finale of my show this week, and the star is missing, and my have been abducted by a cabal of powerful black celebrities! That sounds stressful.
 Has anybody heard from Tracy at all? Grizz, Dotcom, anything? Well, I guess if he's not back by tomorrow morning, we'll give some of his parts to Josh and cut the rest.
 Can I play Barack Obama? No, it's bad enough we have Tracy playing Barack Obama.
 I'm trying to get a head count for the end-of-the-year party.
 Should I include Tracy and his guests, or do you think he's dead? He's not dead, he's just Lemon, could I speak with you a moment? I know you and I are not on good terms.
 But we do need to work together to bring Tracy back here.
 Do you think I'm trying to not find Tracy? Well, Lemon, I cannot endure another failure.
 Jack, trust me.
 Nobody wants to do the show without Tracy.
 We used to do it every week without him.
 I'm just saying.
 Ugh! I hope he's okay.
 I hope he's taking his medication.
 And I hope he took a jacket, 'cause it can get real chilly there.
 I'm sorry, but I swore I wouldn't tell anyone where Tracy is.
 Kenneth, my ex-girlfriend is a member of the Black Crusaders.
 I can make all this go away.
 My lips are sealed.
 Key in pocket.
 You are pissing off the wrong guy, Parcell.
 You turd-faced goon.
 I will cut you open like a tauntaun You tell me where he is.
 you mouth-breathing Appalachian! Fine.
 I will tell you.
 Right now.
 That you are never gonna find him.
 Mr.
 Jordan! Mr.
 Jordan! Uh, I think you have me confused with someone else.
 My name is Gordon Tremeshko.
 Oh.
 I'm Jesse Parcell.
 Kenny's cousin.
 Kenny should have given you the code word.
 What? That's it! Such a thrill to meet you.
 Hey, thanks for taking me in, Jesse.
 I won't be a burden.
 Now make me a smoothie and let's go clubbing.
 Ohwe don't have dancin' or liquor here.
 But cousin Kenneth sent me all your movies.
 At night, I laugh so hard, it really riles up the wolves, yeah! Oh, I loved Honky Grandma Be Trippin'! This-- Check it, check it.
 Now, you boys sit down, so this honky grandma gonna show you how to break dance! Then he went--ooh! Check it two times.
 It was so funny, I nearly wet my other pair of underpants! Did you call Tracy's wife on the phone? Yeah, as far as she knew, he's been shooting a vampire movie in Bucharest since February.
 Lemon, I'm getting married in a couple of days, and I don't need any more stress in my life right now.
 Jackie-kins! Colleen! I mean, Mom! Ohh! Never mind! Well, well, well, well, well.
 Ha ha, this must be the one.
 Huh? Phoebe.
 Welcome! No, no, no.
 No, I-- Welcome, welcome, welcome! Mother, mother this is not Phoebe.
 No, no.
 This is not Phoebe? Well, why the hell not? I mean, she's perfect.
 Character, she got strength of character.
 And I'll tell you something else.
 She's got a good, solid, baby bucket.
 You are a sassy old broad, aren't you? Hello.
 Uh, mother, this is Phoebe.
 Phoebe, this is my mother.
 Hello, Mother Doneghy.
 I'm Phoebe.
 It's such a pleasure to meet you.
 I love your little hat.
 Oh, my God.
 Hmm.
 I'll get it.
 Hello? Rooster, this is the farmer.
 Is the egg safe? The egg is in the nest.
 Good.
 But be careful.
 The badger and the bear have been asking questions.
 I don't know who you're talking about.
 Listen, you don't have to worry about Tracy, okay? He's with his biggest fan.
 Hillbilly.
 Hayseed.
 Was that Kenneth? What's going on in New York? Did he go to Russell Simmons' birthday party? Were there girls there with butts? Mr.
 Jordan, you need to forget about New York.
 You're not a movie star anymore.
 Your name's Gordon Tremeshko.
 You live in Needmore, Pennsylvania, where we don't go out at night.
 'Cause of the wolves.
 Right.
 I nearly almost got through the whole season without him going completely bonkers.
 But now, you know, he's just gone.
 And if he doesn't get back in time, I'm gonna have to rewrite the whole show.
 Hey, I'm sorry, but can we talk about something besides work? Um, okay.
 What's the weather like there? Um it's actually in the mid-40s.
 Oh, really, 'cause it's-- it's low '40s here.
 Really? Yeah.
 Wow.
 So what are you doing? I'm, uh I'm waiting for the bus.
 So, uh I should probably just focus-- focus on that, you know.
 Oh, okay.
 Um, call me later? Ok, bye.
 No, I haven't found him yet.
 I have to go to dinner tonight with my mother and Phoebe.
 And my mother has requested that you join us.
 Shelikes you.
 Uhh! No way.
 She's not asking.
 She's telling.
 Please.
 And try to get her to like Phoebe.
 Just a little, okay? You owe me.
 Okay, fine.
 But I want a lobster.
 Okay.
 I want two lobsters! Totaling five pounds of lobster meat.
 And then after that, we can clean the dead birds out of the chimney.
 That's why we bought these metal rods.
 Don't you just love spring? Baltimore was amazing.
 You know Wacky Willy, that DJ from 102.
7? We totally did it in the prize van.
 I'll pretty much do anything to someone that's famous.
 What's up? What are you looking at? I'll tell you what you're looking at.
 I'm Gordon Tremeshko.
 I always thought it would be lovely to get married in the spring.
 Just as the petunias start to bloom.
 Sorry, Phoebe, what? I always wanted to marry in the spring.
 Just as the petunias bloom.
 Just when the what? Oh, dear.
 Is she hard of hearing? No, no, no, no! I can hear you.
 I just wanted to make sure you could hear you.
 Right.
 I'm off to the loo.
 Loo! What a good idea.
 All right.
 Scout's honor.
 What do you think of her? She's very well-read.
 And she's very stylish, don't you think? And, you know, the most important thing is she makes Jack very happy.
 She's like awhite geisha.
 A white geisha? Say no more, shark eyes.
 Jack I want you to face facts.
 All right? She is not the right girl for you.
 You got it wrong with "Bianka.
" You remember? And now you're getting it wrong with what's-her-name.
 Well, you oughta know, Colleen.
 The only marriage in the history of St.
 Helen's Catholic Church where the priest recommended the divorce! And it's not "Bi-anka," like Sanka.
 It's "Bi-ahnca," like Willy Won--Wonka.
 Are you all right? Could we order dessert? Studio 6-H.
 Kenneth! You have to come get me! Really? But what about the Black Crusaders? I don't care what they do to me anymore.
 I'd rather die famous than to live for 100 years like this.
 Licking pinecones, carrying plastic bags.
 Brushing my own teeth.
 This is unsuitable! Mr.
 Jordan, if you're serious, then we've got less than 24 hours.
 The show needs you.
 What are ya doin'? Hey, dude! Jesse! Hey, listen, I gotta get out of here because You're not goin' anywhere.
 And that phone is for local calls only! Aah! Hello? Did you have a chance to look at those silk samples I brought you? No.
 Jack, you desperately need new pajamas.
 They do such beautiful things.
 It's like wearing your own skin to bed.
 That sounds wonderful.
 Have you ever thought about a fair finish for that ceiling? Shh.
 Careful, my bones! You all right? Well, with your condition, ordinarily, wouldn't you just be on top? I can't.
 I have vertigo.
 It's a bloody shame nobody waits for their wedding night anymore! Go to bed, Mother! You promised you'd go over my taxes! Oh, God's sake.
 Here it comes.
 The big one.
 Ride it, Donaghy.
 Ride it straight to hell! Bollocks.
 You still at work, ha? Yeah, of course.
 Tracy's gone.
 I'm still at work.
 It's a nightmare.
 Ugh! Is that how far apart my eyes are? I look like Admiral Akbar.
 Relax.
 It's one of the reasons I like you.
 So listen, I was going to fly out there on Saturday.
 But I've got a bunch of stuff to take care of.
 So now I'm gonna fly out there.
 I'm gonna come out there next Wednesday.
 Oh, wh-what's this thing doing now? What? Uh-oh.
 Yeah, Liz--working.
 Breaking up.
 Did you say we're breaking up? Yeah.
 What? Who is this? It's 3:00 in the morning.
 Hello? Liz Wait.
 What? Oh, my God.
 Are you breaking up with me? What hospital? Wait, whoa, Liz No, no, no.
 There has to be some sort of misunderstanding.
 I'm his fiancée.
 I'm sorry, you're not family, and you're not his emergency contact.
 Oh! Now, his mother can go in if she wants to.
 Oh, no! I'm not going in there.
 I go in there, I get bird flu, I don't come out.
 Hi, I'm Liz Lemon.
 Somebody called me.
 Oh, yes, Mr.
 Donaghy designated you as his emergency contact.
 What? Ladies! What? This? No, no.
 I was at a costume party earlier this evening.
 And the hostess's dog attacked me, so I had to stab it.
 Oh! Jack's going to be fine.
 But he has had a pretty serious cardiac episode.
 Also, I suspect he may have scurvy, because he keeps asking for lemon.
 Uh, no that's me.
 Oh! Tell him his mother's here! And she loves him.
 But not in a queer way.
 Lemon, is that you? Yeah, it's me.
 How are you feeling? They gave me something.
 My mouth tastes like purple.
 Okay.
 I saw it, Lemon.
 My whole life passing right before my eyes.
 Neil Patterson pitching me the rotating microwave tray.
 Me personally coining the phrase, "What's the upside?" Participating in Hands Across America.
 And all the time I've been on this earth, I have only one regret.
 I should have worked more.
 That's what you're taking away from this experience? Work is the only thing I'm good at.
 Lemon, you and I have that in common.
 No, Jack, that's not true.
 I've been rolling calls from here.
 Trying to spin this Tracy thing.
 No, Jack, forget about Tracy.
 You have to relax.
 No, no, no, no, no, no.
 You've got to get back to work and come up with something with or without Tracy, or we are gonna be screwed.
 Okay.
 Maybe this is the drugs talking but I think I got Nixon to agree to come on the show and say, "Sock it to me.
" Great.
 How's the Dow doing? You'll like my cousin Jesse.
 He's real sweet.
 Ooh, they got a door! That's new.
 Hello there, cousin.
 What brings you to Parcell Hollow? Well, I'm here to pick up Tracy, of course.
 Well, that's peculiar.
 Why, he just left first thing this morning.
 (Kenny) Oh.
 Oh, I must have misunderstood him.
 Must have.
 Sorry you came all this way for nothin'.
 I'd invite you in, but I got a living room full of dead chimney birds.
 Agh! Shh, shh, shh, shh.
 We must rest, my chimney bird.
 Tonight, we're reading my screenplay.
 I just timed the show, and without Tracy, we're still 20 minutes short.
 Liz, on the show, I could do the thing where I walk like Robocop.
 Zzz! Zzz! Your move, creep.
 That's great, that's completely topical.
 Ooh, hey, Cerie.
 Would you like to dance in front of the band on TV tonight? For, like, ten minutes.
 What band? Our house band.
 No, thanks.
 Uh, Floyd called.
 Ugh.
 How's that going? Not great.
 We had a web chat last night, and I thought he said he wanted to break up with me.
 Oh, that must have freaked you out.
 Actually, I was kind of relieved.
 Hey, guys.
 I hear you're looking for someone to dance in front of the band.
 Uhno.
 Uhno.
 Oh.
 Isn't this exciting? Everyone pulling together.
 I think the show's gonna be really good this week.
 Oh, I hope Tray's okay.
 Ohh, Floyd.
 Tracy! Time for lunch.
 I hope you like chicken neck-- Tracy has escaped.
 Thanks, Kenny, for saving me! I'll have you in New York in time for your traditional pre-show rant! I think it's gonna be about immigration! By the hammer of Thor! (Tracy) Now go! Go, go, go! I'm gonna find you! I know what you look-- I remember what you look like! You're so stupid! I gotta reload! Damn, I wish I had a vehicle! Jack, I'm filling out all-new paperwork to make me your emergency contact.
 Of course, Phoebe.
 You should.
 I mean, it's just so embarrassing.
 Mr.
 Donaghy.
 You want dessert? Good God, yes.
 Uh, let me ask you a few questions, Jack.
 You dye your hair? No, Mother.
 Why would I do that? Okay.
 What's your middle name? What? Just your middle name! Francis.
 Did you take $20 out of my pocketbook in the summer of 1970? No, I did not! Do you love me? Of course I do! I knew it.
 Do you love me? I see.
 God! They got pretzels downstairs! Ohh! We're so close, and yet so far.
 Come on! Hey, do you guys know what's causing the traffic problem? Yeah, the president's in town.

 Well,you look great.
 I can't believe I haven't spoken to you since your heart attack.
 That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
 Nobody from corporate knows about my cardiac event, and I want to leave it that way.
 I'm back,lemon.
 I've had the most productive summer of my life.
 Me too.
 All of my summer replacement shows were big hits.
 America's next topirate, are you stronger than a dog, milf island.
 Milf island? Oh,yeah.
 Didn't one of those women turn out to be a prostitute? That doesn't mean she's not a wonderful,caring milf.
 Well,uh,I had a great summer too.
 And,um-- did youredecorate or-- sir,I have all the latest seinfeldvision promos.
 Oh,wonderful! What's seinfeldvision? Well,I realized that nbc owns hundreds of hours of footage of seinfeld from his massively successful television series seinfeld.
 So my old tech guys were able to digitally capture seinfeld, and now we can basically make him do or say whatever we want.
 So for the month of october, all of our prime time shows will feature a computerized guest appearance from mr.
 Jerry seinfeld.
 If you didn't kill her, why didn't you stay? Quit grillin' me! Seinfeldvision save the cheerleader.
 Save the world.
 ********* Yah! That's what I said.
 Seinfeldvision dealor no deal? I'll take that deal! Does jerry seinfeld know you're doing this? Jerry's in europe with his family right now.
 But by the time he gets back, seinfeldvision will be a monster hit, and his kids'll go to school, and their friends'll say i really loved your dad in that episode of medium last night, and he'S he's gonna love it.
 Well,I had a great summer too.
 I started a quilt.
 I did yoga twice a week.
 I wore flip-flops in public.
 I really feel like this is gonna be my year.
 Biggest loser.
 So what's up with floyd? Uh,we broke up.
 We agreed that it was crazy to try it long-distance, and I feel great about t it.
 Oh,come on,lemon.
 If there's two things i'm certain of, one is you will never finish that quilt, I know.
 And you are not over floyd.
 No,I really am,jack.
 I'm telling you, this is my year.
 I feel like the show's gonna be great, and I'm very positive that i'm gonna meet someone else.
 Lemon,women your age are more likely to be mauled at the zoo than get married.
 Good to see you.
 Bye.
 Glad we're botdoing so great.
 Put floyd's name on that quilt.

L.
 Hughley! No.
 I'm not doing any of that.
 J.
S.
! Oh,tracy.
 What's up? Liz lemon,me and this dude used to do standup together.
 Remember that night we had a three-way with elayne boosler? I don't think that was me.
 Oh,yeah.
 You know what? I think that was a mirror.
 J.
S.
,This is my kenneth.
 Ah,yeah.
 You again.
 Hello.
 Jonathan,when is he gonna meet with jerry? This is taking forever.
 mr.
 Donaghy left.
 What? When? Just a few minutes ago.
 Jack? Jack? Jack.
 Jerry? Is that you? Nobody told me you were here.
 Oh,I'm here,jack.
 Kenneth,why didn't you tell me mr.
 Seinfeld is here? What's wrong with him? hello? Hello,I'm sorry.
 May I speak to floyd,please? Oh,he's in theshower.
 I am conducting a survey for the ranford group.
 And,uhhow old are you? And your weight? And when was the last time you had intercourse? Who is this? Who are you? I'm your worst nightmare,is who I is! He's got some girl over there already! That is so embarrassing for you.
 So how can I help you,jerry? Jack,I was vacationing with my family in europe in a country only rich people know about.
 Svenborgia? No.
 Better.
 But I can't tell you.
 Anyway, my mother called to tell me that I'm gonna be on law and order! And E.
R.
 So I called my agent to find out when did I shoot these things? That's the beauty of this,jerry.
 It's all done with computers.
 When you see it, you're gonna love it.
 And one beloved american comedy star.
 this wednesday on milf island really? Is that really your pitch? Okay.
 I get it.
 This is a two-way street.
 All right,jerry, what nbc shows do you want to be digitally inserted into? I like lost.
 Is that you guys? Jerry, don't be difficult.
 The fact of the matter is that seinfeldvision is perfectly legal, and there's nothing you can do to stop us.
 I'm sorry,but it's business.
 Here's some business.
 How 'bout I buy nbc and turn it into the biggest lane bryant in midtown? Jerry,come on.
 You're gonna buy nbc, like you've got $4 million just laying around jerry,I'm sorry.
 Give me two days and I'll come up with something you'll really be proud of.
 Besides,you owe me.
 Remember,st.
 Barts,I saved your life from that shark? All right,jack.
 I'll come back.
 But I still think you shot a dolphin.
 hi.
 I'm here to drop off the inspiration photos.
 And you are the mother.
 Bridesmaid,yes.
 That's my dress.
 Don't buy that.
 That looks ugly on you.
 eah, you'll thank me.
 Is that dress still on sale? Yes.
 You know,a lot of women buy their perfect dress when they see it, and then just trust the fact that the husband will come.
 Yeah.
 Well,this is my year.
 I mean,floyd's moving on.
 I'm moving on too.
 I'm just doing it in my own order.
 I'm gonna get the wedding dress, and then I'm gonna have a baby, and then I'm gonna die, and then I'm gonna meet a super-cute guy in heaven.
 Yeah.
 I'm not kidding,blondie.
 Get out of the dress.
 I'll need to spread it over a couple of different credit cards.
 Lemon,I am in full-blown crisis mode.
 I've already sold 20 million dollars' worth of ad time for seinfeldvision, and now jerry wants to pull the plug.
 But I don't care,because i thrive in crisis mode.
 That's when I'm really at my best.
 And the fact that I do not have one idea how to solve this only energizes me more.
 I've been brainstorming all night--here we go.
 Number one--kill seinfeld.
 Number two--kill seinfeld,then kill myself.
 Number three--kill seinfeld,flee to svenborgia,then kill myself.
 Jack,I'm not having the best day either.
 Number 70-- you seduce seinfeld.
 Now,why is me seducing seinfeld all the way at 70? Number 71--I fake a hurricane, and all regularly scheduled programming is preempted.
 These are terrible ideas.
 There are no bad ideas in brainstorming,lemon.
 I'm sure I'll come up with something at the 11th hour.
 I always do, 'cause I'm just that good.
 It was on sale.
 I'm mad at you,ken.
 I seen the way you was lookin' eld.
 You used to look at me like that.
 What,am I not a big enough star for you any i am not even gonna dignify that wwer.
 Especial I picked out all these throw pillows for in here, and you didn't even notice! Hey,everyone.
 I know what you're thinking.
 How did I lose 25 pounds in one day? I didn'T.
 It's visual trickery.
 Drawing the eye up.
 hey,liz,you gotta see this.
 Jenna looks bananas-- Nope,the real crazy is in here.
 Liz lost it.
 It was on sale.
 I thought you and floyd broke up.
 We did,and I am doing great with it.
 I just bought a dress.
 Because,you know,I don't need society's permission to buy a white dress i mean,who says this is a wedding dress anyway? In korea,they wear ite to funerals.
 All right,uh, I'm in charge now.
 Everyone go home.
 I'm not crazy,frank.
 I'm making a statement.
 That,if need be, I will marry myself.
 And I am not embarrassed that you guys are seeing me wearing this.
 So you're intending to wear thatall day.
 Yeah,chocolate rain,maybe I am.
 liz,um,seinfeld's here, and jack's not ready for him.
 So you need to give him another tour.
 Wonderful.
 Hello,jerry.
 Well,well,well.
 So you called that boyfriend.
 Yes,I did.
 And it went well? No,it didn't,jer.
 A woman answered.
 Another woman already? What did you say to her? I did a fake survey.
 You did the fake survey? I know.
 I'm not over it! And now I'm wearing this! What is the deal with my life? Are you imitating me? No! This is what i sound like when I cry! I think I'm a little insulted! You're insulteying! ********* I got nothin'.
 Mr.

 What the hell are you doing? God--oh,god,jerry! I got nothing! I got nothing! You've got to do this for me,please! Oh,god,I've already sold the ad time! What is wrong with you people? What's happened to this network? Call off your goons! All right,kenneth.
 All right,listen,seinfeld.

 Don't do it,liz lemon.
 I know what me and kenneth have looks perfect on the outside, but it's work,damn it.
 It's work.
 How'd it go with seinfeld? I think I pulled it off.
 Good god,lemon, what's happened to you? I thought this was going to be your year.
 I couldn't even hold it together one week.
 I'm not you,jack.
 I can't have a heart attack and pretend like it never happened.
 I can't break up with someone and immediately recover.
 I'm not you.
 I'm just me.
 Lemon,don't ever say you're just you.
 Because you are better than you.
 And I am not going to let you give up.
 This is going to be our year.
 Now,give me the ham.
 I like the ham.
 Come on.
 Proudly Presents Season 02 Episode 01 $4,000 ham napkin.
 I look pretty,though,right? Don't push it,lemon.
   

                




                    			- you *** see me? yes I did.
 this is a $54 steak.
 Congratulations.
 It looks really good.
 Yes,it does.
 And of course I can't eat it because of my recent,uh heart attack.
 Secret heart attack.
 No strenuous activity, no red meat,no booze.
 But I thought perhaps you might enjoy it.
 Oh,okay.
 Thanks.
 This'll make a great sandwich tomorrow.
 Oh,no--I would like you to eat it here.
 Right now.
 You want to watch me eat this steak in front of you? That's what I want.
 Okay.
 This is a time of new beginnings for me,lemon.
 And of course that means new opportunities.
 Have you read the interview with don geiss in this month's issue of yachting illustrated? Uh,no.
I subscribe to giant boats.
 "'The ocean,'" says geiss, "'like business, "with a pillowy abyss of a lover's bosom, "seems infinite, but all things must end.
'" Pillowy abyss? Ignore that part.
 "All things must end.
 " Geiss is sending signals about retirement, about succession.
 By talking about sex in a sailing magazine? That's exactly how margaret thatcher did it.
 Geiss' job is the most coveted position in the free world.
 Well,you're in the runng for it,right? I would like to think so.
 But I've got to do something to raise my profile, to distinguish me in some way and I have to do it soon-- you ate that whole thing? A dog took it.
 He came out of nowhere.
 Proudly Presents Season 2 Episode 02 Hey,jenna, what's up? Pretty good.
 Are you okay? Oh,I'm fine,jenna.
 I'm just a little light-headed.
 I'm on a crash diet to get back to my old weight by friday.
 Well,what diet is gonna do that? Oh,it's the japanese porn star diet.
 I only eat paper, but I can eat all the paper I want,so hey there.
 Hi.
 Jenna.
 This isn't healthy.
 Maybe you're jusfighting your natural shape.
 When did your mom gain all that weight? Oh,god! My point is don't let people make you crazy about this.
 You are just as beautiful and talented as you ever were.
 Nono,no,no-- you are fat.
 Now go and see dr.
 Spaceman right now and get this taken care of.
 How come men can be heavy and be respected? Like james gandolfini or fat albert? It's a double standard, and america needs to get over its body-image madness.
 Oh,come on.
What,are we back in college freshman year? Let's go to the common room and talk about apartheid.
 Yeah,well,okay-- I'm sorry if I care about making the world a better place.
 You should be; it's a complete waste of time and it prevents you from dealing with this.
 Excuse me,what about this do I have to deal with? How's your love life going? I believe that love comes to you when you're not looking for it.
 Did you return that wedding dress that you bought? I'm gonna sell it online but my internet is being weird.
 How about the furniture for your home office? Have you even set that up yet? I'm not making excuses,jack.
 But this is taken care of-- ow! Oh,it hurts! I missed a dentist appointment this morning.
 Josh to the stage,please, for illeana douglas talk show.
 Son of a bitch.
 banks.
What are you doing in town? You drawn to the phallic nature of our skyline? Ha,very funny,jack.
 How gay is this? I'm here visiting my fiance.
 What? Kathy, this is jack donaghy.
 Banks,have you lost your mind? Oh,did I forget to mention that kathy is kathy geiss, as in don geiss' daughter? Can you believe that don thought she'd never get married? You can't,you're gay.
 No,not anymore,friend.
 You familiar with the church of practicology? You mean the cult that was invented by stan lee? The religion founded by the alien king living inside stan lee.
 See,it's my faith in practicology that has helped me uncover my true, straight self.
 It's definitely working.
 I can totally feel the gay draining right out of me.
 By the eye of zolnak, right,guys? You're gonna be don geiss' son-in-law? That's right.
 And if you read his recent interview in the harvard gay business review, you'd know that he's thinking about retirement.
 But I guess I'll find out more about that tonight at dinner with geiss at a restaurant.
 Josh to the stage,please yo,ken.
 Uh,angie and grizz is coming by to drop some of my stuff off.
 Oh,okay.
 Yeah,but I want her to know that I'm having a good time on my n, so you should go get us some party hats.
 The pointy kind.
 Mr.
 Jordan,can't you just apologize to her? No!'Cause things have been said that cannot be taken back.
 She called my vanity license plate inscrutable! ICU81MI "I see you ate one,am I?" Hilarious.
 Angie is in the past, like dracula and broadcast television.
 I think you're letting your pride get in the way, mr.
 Jordan.
 I mean,if you saw angie with another man-- with who?That guy mike that re-did our driveway? Nah,whatever.
 She should find someone new.
 Doesn't bother me.
 Dotcom,I have an idea.
 Well,I don't know, but it's worth a shot.
 Are you even listening to me? Now,jenna, medically speaking, for your height, your weight puts you in what we call the disgusting range.
 Fortunately, there are solutions.
 For example, crtal meth has been shown to be very effective.
 How important is tooth retention to you? It's pretty important.
 What about my crazy surgical options,dr.
 Spaceman? Oh,please-- dr.
 Spaceman is my dad.
 Call me leo.
 And there are some wonderful crazy surgical options.
 Are you familiar with the bradshaw clinic? Am I? That's where the olsen twins were separated.
 I've sent a mber of my famous clients there.
 I can make a call, get you in as soon as possible.
 Thank you,leo.
 I can't be on television looking like i just had a baby or something.
 You know, this right here is why I got into medicine.
 Devin's a genius.
 A genius? Isn't he just living a lie to get ahead at work? Well,we all have our secrets.
 Devin's pretending to be straight.
 I'm trying to keep my heart episode under wraps.
 And alan garkel in legal-- I don't think he really needs that wheelchair.
 No.
 Oh,mr.
 Banks.
 I didn't see you there.
 Well,I've been following you for the better part of an hour,kenneth.
 Does mr.
 Donaghy know you're here? I don't need jack's permission,kenneth.
 I'm gonna be running this place soon, and there are gonna be some changes to the page's uniform, certainly.
 Mr.
 Banks,mr.
 Donaghy eats guys like you as part of a healthy breakfast.
 And I'm sure you think he's weak right now, but he's only gotten stronger since his heart attack.
 heart attack? Really? Right,mr.
 D? High five! Not now? Okay.
 What is this? Liposuction? Plus bone-shaving and organ reduction.
 Liz,you don't understand.
 People look at me differently know.
 Jack,the writers, the manager at forever 21.
 That is their problem, not yours.
 Is this clinic on a boat? Hey,I've got a character for jenna called, "me want food.
" She's in a supermarket and she keeps going, "me want food!" What?No,we are not treating jenna any differently.
 She's gonna play all the characters that she usually plays, like hillary clinton-- that's awesome.
 Fat hillary.
 She can be,like, "me want food!" No one is saying, "me want food," frank.
 We are gonna showcase jenna's talents.
 Can I sing a song on the show? Yes,that's a great idea.
 Can I sing and roller dance? Yes.
 Yeah,because we are gonna dare america to change their own attitudes about body image.
 Why do you have to make everything into an issue? Don't you have things to do in your own life? At least I don't live with my mom--ow.
 hey,my mom's cool.
 I got my own life together, okay? Holy crap, did your tooth just fall out? Oh,that's not great,huh? oh,check this out.
 My key to the city of gary,indiana.
 Mm,look at this.

 I'm a real good sex person.
 I do it all the different ways.
 Well,I don't have a husband anymore, so you can come over anytime.
 Oh,I will.
 I'll come over at night.

 She got big.
 Oh,her center of gravity is a little different.
 Me want food! Did you happen to tell geiss about my little episode? Come on,jack.
 I'd never rat you out.
 Wouldn't want to let you off that easy.
 Here-- take some of my steak.
 I could never eat this much meat.
 That's not what I hear.
 Jack,we're having a little get together up at the house on saturday.
 You should come.
 That would be my pleasure, sir.
 Yeah,you should come.
 It's gonna be a whole day of team sports and beer.

 Maybe pound a cheeseburger in the sun, throw some butter on it.
 You're gonna love it! I'm gonna make your heart explode.
 hey,ken you're up early, mr.
 Jordan.
 I only got 11 or 12 hours of sleep last night.
 I got something on my mind grapes i need to talk to you about.
 Oh,what is it,sir? I saw you hitting on angie the other day.
 Seeing you with her, it opened my eyes.
 Good for you,sir.
 Yeah,all those years fooling around wasn't fair to her.
 So you gotta make it fair! I want you to go to my house and make love to my wife, ken.
 Jiminy christmas! My home address is in the gps under "dacrib" 'cause we live on dacrib avenue.
 Now you go to angie.
 And you make sure you pleasure her! Well,they did laugh.
 At you,jenna.
 At.
 Right,the bad kind.
 You just can't be a real woman in this country.
 God,it's like those dove commercials never even happened.
 Hey!Oh!Me want food! This woman was a mouseketeer, ma'am.

 Me want food! Oh,my god! My own t-shirt! Hey,I am wanting the foods! Very good.
 Very nice.
 Attaboy! Yeah! All right.
 Thanks,jack.
 You earned me a grand! Thank you.
 how's the heart holding up, buddy? You know, you ought to just quit.
 Geiss loves quitters, if I understood his autobiography correctly.
 Oh,wait-- I didn'T.
 You know what? It's all right,jack.
 When you're dead and I'm ceo, oh,my winthrop! How do you do it, man? You're always in such great shape.
 Same weight as when I wrestled at yale,jack.
 Winthrop here wrestled at yale.
 With other dudes,or banks says he can pin you.
 Well,I don't-- okay,well-- you're so strong! Oh,god! You're having your way with me.
 Your back is like a barrel of snakes! Oh,god! I'm just your doll! I think I love you.
 We're joking! It's all jokes! what have I done? Kenneth should be back by now.
 What's going on over at my house? no ordinary love nono! Ehh--I gotta stop this.
 Curvy &amp; Proud Jenna Maroney takes a bite out of life! There she is! "Me want food.
" Did you know, scientifically speaking, that humans want food but don't need it.
 You know--you know, I'm really having second thoughts about all of this.
 Oh,don't worry.
 Dr.
 Wally is the best there is.
 In a few hours,you'll be back to your old self.
 It'll be like none of this ever happened.
 I'm keeping it! Uh,what? The fat.
 I've decided to keep it because people recognize me, and I get off on it.
 No,if you're gonna do this it's gotta be because we are proving a point to the world.
 I'm not trying to prove anything.
 And you've got to stop telling people how to run their lives.
 That's not what this is.
 And it's kind of hard to take life advice from a single woman who is using her treadmill as a hanger for a wedding dress.
 Oh,I guess I'm just supposed to put it in the closet with ham fat all over it.
 And who's wearing a one-piece swimsuit instead of underwear.
 I have to do laundry.
 there he is! Hey,jack.
 Want a hot dog? Oh,right! The sodium.
 Bum-bum.
 Bum-bum.
 Ka-boom.
 Just so you know, if you hear this sound at your funeral, it's just me laughing! I can't hear you,banks.
 Are you saying you want me to help you? And if I do, you'll stop trying to destroy me in front of geiss? That is what you're saying, right? Here we go.
 You're insane.
 That's it! I quit! No more football.
 Jack wins.
 quitter! Oh,god! Just like the greeks! I'm gonna kill you, kenneth the page! I'm sorry,mr.
 Jordan.
 I couldn't do it.
 This boy comes to the door, tries to kiss me, then he throws up and starts crying.
 My body wouldn't let me violate the sacred bonds of marriage,sir.
 It was a gesture,angie! I'm saying I'm sorry.
 I'm at the end of my rope, tracy jordan.
 But baby-- oh,mmm.
 No more jewelry with my name misspelled.
 Anjy No more sexually explicit sky writing.
 And no more white boys throwing up in my damn foyer.
 What do you want? I'm willing to try anything.
 Okay,here's what I want.
 From now on,I'm on you like white on rice.
 You are not to leave my sight for one secondever.
 All right.
 If that's what it takes.
 If that's what it takes.
 Love you,baby.
 This grilled cheese has mayonnaise in it!What? Is it really worth it? I wonder.
 I mean,I almost let a man die today,caitlin.
And for what? For a bigger office? For more money? Jack.
 So how's the ticker? Devin told me.
 He said you're not a well man.
 Well,why don't we forget about devin for the moment.
 Are you concerned about my heart,sir? No,not at all.
 Not after today.
 You're out there with those boys in your condition.
Talk about heart.
 Take care of yourself,jack.
 I've technically died twice.
It's not fun.
 But I'm not gonna be around forever.
And,uh, at some point i want to spend more time with my grandkids.
 Take my boat down to the islands.
 Get to know my secret family up in canada.
 But I want you to know you're on my list.
 Jack you might run this company one day.
 Thank you,sir.
 You mind if I watch you eat that? Okay.
   

                




                    			one day sirThis whole city will be yours.
 Oh,hey, can I talk to you? You always ruin everything.
 I have to apologize for him.
 He's been a bit tense since we found that I'm up for the G.
 E.
 Chairmanship.
 Yeah,that's why I'm here.
 I got a call from some lawyer today who was asking me what kind of boss you are, and who long i've known you, and what animal best describes you.
 What did you say? An eagle with the head of a bear.
 Thank you.
 Your respect means the world to me,lemon.
 I can't believe it's starting already.
 What is? G.
 E.
 Is vetting me.
 They're trying to see if I have any skeletons in my closet.
 It's what they do with all the presidential candidates.
 Do you think they'll find anything? Oh,yeah.
 I've done some things,lemon.
 That's why I hired a private investigator to look into my own background.
 He'll spot any red flags before G.
 E.
 Does, and that way I should be able to stay ahead of this.
 You hired someone to investigate yourself? That's weird.
 Well,you do the same thing with you therapist every week,don't you? I had an amazing breakthrough with my therapist this week.
 I was talking about that dream ring ring! That I have all the time where you find- hello.
 I'm sorry, I have to take this.
 Yes.
 Why she's right here.
 Wait a minute.
 That's a fake phone.
 She'll be right down.
 What else is going on? proudly presents Season 02 Episode 03  What's going on in here? You're on time for work.
 The woman in your dressing room is your wife sorry,angie,that- I let tracy back in my life on two conditions.
 One,this.
 Bling,bling! That is ghetto fabulous.
 This belonged to brooke astor.
 It's very nice.
 And the other condition, I'm with him all the time.
 All he gets to do is work, eat,love on me, and sleep.
 Isn't that right,baby? I'm whipped.
 Angie got me up at 7:30 today.
 Did you know in the morning they have food,tv, almost everything.
 It's pretty good.
 I did know that,yeah.
 Liz,I need your help.
 I can't do this alone.
 Tracy's like a horny child.
 He needs constadult supervision.
 Will you help me out when I'm not here? If it keeps him like this,yes.
 Will you be able to do that without falling in love with him? Soes.
 I think this is gonna be great,angie.
 I think you and me are gonna make a great team.
 Oh,you looking for a sassy,black friend? Oh,no,I didn't mean- well,you got one now, girlfriend.
 Go on- rowr! Oh,ms.
 Moroney, he today fan mail.
 Are there any from prisons? Are there? Oh! God! Putting on this weight is the best thing that ever happened to me.
 People actually like me now.
 There she is.
 There's my star.
 And to think I wanted you to lose this weight.
 It sounds so crazy now.
 I know! Oh,and I saw your enorme commercial- it's fabulous.
 What's enorme? It's the number one fragrance for plus size women.
 Enorme.
 Make him chase the chunk.
 available exclusively at your local drug store.
 Do not use if menstrua can't plus size women wear regular perfume? Jenna,your career is really taking off now.
 And on a personal level, I just like you more when you're fat.
 Oh,thank you.
 It's all happening.
 Okay,let's shoot these promos.
 Can I get some makeup for tracy,please? Hi,sweetheart.
 How are you? Y.
 Let's see.
 Oh,hell no! Actually,he looks great.
 Thank you.
 you lenny wozniak? Thanks for meeting me here, mr.
 Donaghy.
 Yeah,I get it.
 Discretion.
 I wouldn't want to talk about this in my office anyway.
 Yeah.
 Also my gym is right over there.
 So,uh how does this work? It's pretty simple, really.
 I'm gonna go through your life with a fine tooth comb.
 And the more information i have, the easier this is gonna be.
 Now,have you ever been arrested? I have.
 The 1976 democratic national convention.
 But it's okay,I was there beating up hippies.
 And what about your family? Any skeletons there? My brother eddie sells faulty sprinkler systems to elementary schools.
 My cousin tim fixes nba games.
 My mother's an olympic level racist.
 But as for the rest, they're too drunk to do much of anything.
 Unless getting thrown out of a chili's is a crime.
 Any weird sex stuff i should know about? You know what? Don't tell me.
 I like to find that out on my own.
 I'm a watcher.
 Okay,I'll get started on my end of the process.
 Now,is there anything else you want to tell me now? Nope.
 That's pretty much it.
 That's what they all say, mr.
 Donaghy.
 I'll be in touch.
 Hmm,one more thing.
 If I sign a friend up at my gym, I get a free hat,so think about it.
 I'm losing weight.
 What? Look at my belt.
 This is the notch I had to make last week.
 This is the notch i'm using now.
 I'm back to the factory made notches.
 Jenna,calm down.
 No,I won't calm down.
 This can't be happening.
 Everything is based on the fat.
 Enorme.
 The offer to play ms.
 Pac man in the live action atari movie.
 What? And worst of all, jack won't like me anymore.
 We have a secret ritual now where we slap our palms together when we walk by each other.
 A high five.
 It was our special thing.
 Hey,liz lemon.
 I've been reading the newspaper to come up with some ideas for some topical sketches.
 So this week can we do "business section? " Tracy,I love it that you're trying to help.
 Everything is great.
 Thanks to angie.
 Word.
 Where is my lovely wife? Oh,she had to step out.
 She had a hair appointment.
 Oh,I'm going to a strip club now.
 What? No,I can't let you do that! I'm sorry,liz.
 Th is who I am.
 You can't ask a bird not to fly.
 You can't ask a fish not to swim.
 You can't ask a tiger not to turn back into a chinese dude at midnight.
 Angie is gonna kill us.
 I feel bad about doing this to you,liz lemon.
 I really do.
 And the only way I could feel better about myself is to get booby- slapped by a coked- out russian stripper.
 I'm out.
 Is there something we need to discuss? No,jack, everything's great! Look it's come to my attention that you no longer have an eating problem.
 That's ridiculous! Is it? You're not breathing heavily.
 Your skin has cleared up.
 I even find you slightly attractive right now.
 Don't say that,jack! Come on.
 Me want food,right? Do you want od,jenna? Do you? I don't know anymore! I have no appetite! It's okay.
 Kenneth! Kenneth here is gonna be with you 24/7 to keep you fat.
 Keep jenna fat, keep jenna funny.
 Am I right,kenneth? It'll be just like back home on the pig farm.
 M gonna fatten you up, grow to love you, and then my uncles'll slit yr thro so what have you got for me,len? Well,mr.
 Donaghy, you're pretty clean.
 And your sex life checks out real nice.
 Thank you.
 There are a couple of things though that could get in the way of this promotion.
 Like you should probably give up your membership to the all white woodvale country club.
 That is not an all white club.
 What about johnny carlos? He's ethnic.
 He's the king of spain,jack.
 I don't think that counts.
 All right,I'll resign.
 Okay,you also have an undocumented domestic employee.
 Manuelo? No,I need manuelo.
 I could never pay an english speaking person that little.
 They'd starve.
 All right, I'll send him home.
 Well,that's it.
 Unless you think i missed something.
 No,I think you've been very thorough.
 It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
 Oh,jack.
 One last thing.
 You don't have a massive collection of cookie jars,do you? How did you find out about that? WELCOME INTERNATINAL***** Collector of the year.
 Congratulations, victor nightingale.
 Thank you.
 Yes,I'm victor nightingale.
 This is bad.
 Ceos don't have thousands of cookie jars.
 Weird little guys in bow ties do.
 You hear what I'm getting at? What? You saying it's a gay thing? You wish it was a gay thing.
 This is worse.
 You've gotta get rid of 'em.
 No,I'm not doing that.
 I've already made enough sacrifices for thisompany.
 They're not gonna get this! This is rudolph giuliani in 1987 with this collection of antique wooden dolls.
 That's a fake! Giuliani doesn't collect dolls.
 Yeah,you're right.
 He doesn'T.
 Because he incinerated them! In 1989,the year he ran for mayor.
 He looks so happy.
 Oh,jack, the choice is yours.
 You can either be the head of the largest corporation in america, or get buried in a bow tie with a bunch of cookie jars.
 Liz lemon, where's tracy? He went to the vet.
 His cobra got sick.
 Okay.
 Hey,everybody.
 I'm back from doing whatever liz lemon said.
 And what was that exactly? Uh,my cobra,ramses.
 He had got sick.
 So I took him to the vet.
 Then my thumb got caught in my butt, so I nodded my head until it came out.
 Come here,you.
 You smell like enorme and brass polish.
 You were at a strip club.
 It was all liz lemon's fault! The whole plan was hers.
 Oh,come on,man! Tracy jordan,you are in for a world of hurt.
 But you're worse.
 I trusted you.
 You wear glasses.
 Your access to tracy jordan is cut off.
 You can't cut me off.
 This I my show! Not anymore.
 Everything goes through me now- come! Good bye forever, liz lemon.
 Thank you for being my secretary! normally I would tell tracy our sketch ideas.
 Okay.
 In the opening sketch this week, tracy is a bank robber- no.
 I don't want to perpetuate any black stereotypes.
 Next.
 in this one,tracy plays a gentleman who wears flamboyant clothes and lives uptown.
 He's a pimp.
 He's an entrepreneur.
 What's the character's name? Slick back lamar.
 He's also playing barack obama.
 No.
 We support kucinich.
 Listen,angie, I'm sorry I lied, but you gotta give me excuse me.
 Did you just try to control my body with your white hand? don't make me contact reverend sharpton.
 I can't deal with you.
 I want new writers for tracy, or he doesn't do the show.
 Grizz,dotcom, start coming up with ideas.
 We open on a lone soldier walking through the desert.
 The year1861.
 The place Mars.
 Thistuff will make you real fat,ms.
 Moroney.
 It made my dad's heart just up and give out.
 And that's what made my mom's friend ron move in.
 Coming in for a landing There's turbulence.
 And now an indian guy got up to use the bathroom and an air marshal shot him.
 No,no,I can'T.
 Boy,I wish I had some pig sedative right now.
 good bye,cookie jars.
 Thank you for taking care of this for me.
 No problem,mr.
 Donaghy.
 Oh,this is for the best.
 No more secrets,nothing standing in my way now.
 Just out of curiosity, what exactly are you going to do with all of these? They'll be taken to jersey city and incinerated.
 Oh,no.
 No,no,no,no.
 I can't have that- give that to me.
 It's your funeral,donaghy.
 I can't destroy them.
 I'll give them to someone.
 A fellow ceramophile.
 You're like john kerry with his wind surfing.
 I warned him too.
 Hey,how'd it go with angie? Terrible.
 She hates me.
 She's hijacking the show.
 I've gotta talk to jack.
 Oh,you want a scary black lady to be nice to you? Tell her you like her nails.
 Always works for me at the bank.
 Hmm.
 Ms.
 Lemon,may I speak with you? Sure,can you walk and talk? Uh,usually,but now you got me thinking about it.
 Jenna with problem i have there it is.
 I'm supposed to be helping ms.
 Moroney stay fat, but it's not working.
 How do I get her to eat? eat because they feel bad about themselves.
 Maybe that's the problem.
 Everything's going so well for ms.
 Moroney right now.
 Yeah,so be mean to her.
 Women with low self esteem take refuge in either food or sex.
 Not me,of course.
 Hi,I just wanted to meet you,mr.
 Mason.
 I'm a really big fan.
 Who picked out your outfit? Stevie wonder? So you gotta be mean,kenneth.
 I guess I could wait for her to drop something and then say, "smooth move,exlax.
 " That's what my mom's friend ron would do.
 Oh,brother.
 All right,jenna really wants this,huh? Her career depends on it.
 Please help.
 Okay,do you have something to write on? Oh.
 Oh,I got one.
 Sir,someone else called about purchasing your collection.
 A mr.
 Gary heingarten.
 No,jonathan, he lives in albany.
 The temperature fluctuations alone would- these things expand and contract.
 They're alive,jonathan.
 Hey,do you have a minute? Tracy's wife is- what's with the cookie jar? I collect them.
 Really? Is that some sort of unresolved childhood thing? Nice try.
 We never had any cookie jars in my home because my mother never baked us any cookies because she never felt we deserved any cookies.
 So obviously it has nothing to do with my childhood.
 But that cookie jar says "mom" on it.
 I don't think so.
 I've always viewed it as an upside down wow.
 But it doesn't matter now, because I have to,um, get rid of them all.
 Why? Because the guy with the weird hobby never gets the corner office.
 Lemon,what is going on on your stage right now? This is what I came to talk to you about.
 Tracy's wife is out of control.
 Did you tell her you like her fingernails? No.
 But I thought that we could give her a consultant credit.
 It's meaningless, but it might calm her down.
 Lemon,I'm impressed.
 You're beginning to think like a businessman.
 A businesswoman.
 I don't think that's a word.
 Unfortunately,what you've gotten yourself into is not a business situation but a family conflict, so it's tricky.
 So what do I do about angie? I think you're gonna have to fight her.
 What? Yeah.
 You throw her out.
 She'll probably punch you in the face.
 Then we eject her from the building and we bar her for life.
 Now,I think angie's right handed, so you have to work her clockwise.
 Wait,you've already thought about fighting her? Every time I meet a new person i figure out how I'm gonna fight 'em.
 You have a gimpy left knee,right? No,I'm not gonna fight anybody,jack.
 I'm just gonna give her the stupid title and she'll back off.
 Lemon,you're gonna get hit in the face, and it's gonna hurt like hell.
 You want to lean in to take away their momentum.
 Hands up,come on! I don't want to.
 Lean in,come on.
 Oh,jack,stop it! hello,jenna.
 "Still failing at over eating just like you fail at everything in your life? " What? "You quitter.
 "You gonna quit this like you quit fashion school? "Give up like you gave up on your relationship with david blaine? " He's the one who drove the wedge with his magic.
 Also,"you've got so many daddy issues, "the only thing keeping you from being a stripper is your weird mole.
 " Kenneth, that's very hurtful.
 "You lied about your brother drowning so people would come to your one woman show.
 " Kenneth,I've never heard you talk this way.
 "Your toes look like dried up shrimps.
 " Oh,daddy! Go on,keep talking.
 What else don't you like about me? Can I help you? Yes,uh, angie,I know you and I got off on the wrong foot here.
 But I want you to know that I appreciate your contribution to the show.
 And so I want to offer you a consultant credit.
 I don't want tt crap title.
 You think you're gonna buy me off so I'll play nice? It's never gonna happen.
 Okay.
 I'm ordering you to leave.
 Excuse me? Get your stuff and get out.
 Don't make me say it again.
 No,liz lemon, don't do it.
 Are you stepping up on me? So what if I am? Also,your nails look tacky.
 Oh,wait a minute! Enough,damn it, enough! Do I have to fix this situation? I am the immature one.
 But the both of you, you're forcing me to act like an adult.
 An adult! And even worse, you're making me stop two ladies from going at it.
 But I don't care.
 'Cause I'm putting my foot down.
 You're putting your foot down with me? Baby,you got to go! You're controlling.
 You're manipulative.
 You're loud- tracy- I've never heard you talk like that before.
 Wait,let me get the shirt off.
 Get it off.
 Okay,so just to be clear, does this mean angie is leaving or- oh,no! You guys start with that? That wow! That is- Mr.
 Donaghy, I've got some bad news.
 I wasn't able to get ms.
 Moroney to eat.
 I'm so sorry.
 What happened? Well,it turns out she's the wrong kind of crazy.
 And I guess we have to get married now.
 Apology accepted, kenneth.
 I suppose we're both having a pretty bad day.
 Ah,look at that kooky old cookie jar.
 I like the upside down "wow" on it.
 You like cookie jars,kenneth? Well,I guess I never thought about it that much we had a nice one back home in georgia.
 Had a bear on it.
 I remember when my mom's friend ron would come over.
 They'd go into the bedroom to sort out their paperwork, and I'd just go ahead and stare at that cookie jar.
 It was almost as if i took every problem that I ever had and I put inside that cookie jar.
 And I sealed it up so tight that nothing would never, ever,ever get out.
 So I guess to answer your question, I'd give cookie jars about a "B.
 " Some people have so many problems that there aren't enough cookie jars in the world to contain them.
 Oh,well,that just kes me sad.
 Kenneth,I have a cookie jar collection.
 Would you like to have it? Of course,sir, I'd love to! Always hold them squarely at the base, never by the lid.
 And should you ever go to the convention in sarasota, please tell patty and beth and all of them that, uh,vic nightingale says hello.
 Uh,okay,sir.

 Hi,I don't wanna sound like a weirdo fan£¬ but Iam obsessed with everything you have ever done.
 And I used to make my friends act out your skits the next day.
 When I say my friends,I mean my fisher price.
 my friend dolls.
 Because I didn't have a lot of friends.
 Oh,boy.
*** You're gonna kill me,aren't you? No,that's.
 Oh,you are great! I grew up wanting to be you.
 I grew up wanting to be samantha stevens on bewitched.
 Closest I got was being married to a gay guy for two years.

 And by heroine,I mean lady hero.
 I don't wanna inject you and listen to jazz.
 Good lord.

 Well,I'm gonna let you take me to lunch later and get all this out of your system.
 That would be great.
 I would love that.
 But you're supposed to take me hat shopping.
 Hey jack! Could you hold on a second? If you desecrate something,is that bad? Tracy,what happened now? I doubt if anybody noticed.
 Who brought stars and bright stars to the party last night for the rascals we fought who wouldhave ever known there was so many words? It was like a mos def cd.
 Tracy,it's all right.
 You're a star,you can do whatever you want to.
 That's your job.
 It's our job to make it go away.
 I love this country.
 You go forth and be crazy.
 I think I can manage that.
 You do anything you wanna do.
 Except no dog fighting,okay? That seems to be the one thing that's off limits these days.
 What's on your mind,tray? You've been curiously quiet for 20 minutes.
 We gotta start doing dog fights.
 Dog fighting? I know it's repulsive and hideous.
 But it's the only thing jack donaghy told me I cannot do.
 So I gotta do it!Understand? No no no no no no no! Dog fighting is the most disgusting,vile thing a human being can do.
 You cannot do it! Dog fighting it is.
 Make it happen.
 Man,this is phil spector's entourage all over again.
 And his foot lingered.
 Ah,that is such an upsetting story.
 I'll never watch happy days the same way again.
 But you know,I miss live tv.
 It's like sex,you know? It's almost better when everything goes horribly wrong.
 Well,you know,we do hire guest writers every now and then.
 I mean,I don't know if that'S.
 something you would ever be interested in.
 That'd be great.
 God,I haven't been in that building in so long.
 Does everyone still do blow in joe garagiola's office? Which one is blow again?Is that cocaine? Hello?Where's the head page? You may enter.
 You're a machine.
 No,I wish.
 This is a prop from the classic nbc series supercomputer.
 Look,you obviously know who I am.
 But what you don't know is that I accidentally damaged kenneth parcell's page jacket and.
 Really? Mr.
 Perfect,Mr.
 Jesus loves me parcell finally messed up? Do you know how long i've been waiting to transfer that thumbhead to cnbc in paramus,new jersey? But you can't transfer someone without a demerit.
 But now.
 oh,boy.
 Here's what we're gonna do.
 You've probably never seen breasts before.
 So I'm gonna lean over this desk,and you're gonna give me a new page jacket.
 Please,I breast fed 'til I was 11.
 So I've forgotten more about a woman's chest than you'll ever know.
 But.
I'm on tv.
 I said,"good day.
 " No,you didn'T.
 Well,I meant to.
 Kenneth parcell is finished.
 Finished! All right,what's in the news this week,everybody? Any ideas? I have an idea.
 We open on a new orleans abortion clinic.
 A beautiful mulatto.
 uh,I don't think we're allowed to use any of those words.
 Why not? It's live television.
 I mean,we used to say And .
 no,you didn'T.
Did you?We did.
We pushed the envelope.
 Remember.
 the mailbox sketch that shocked america? There's nothing wrong here.
 Don't you get it? The mailbox was haldeman.
 Is that a person who lived? What about race? I mean,I say that is the last taboo.
 We get josh in blackface,right? And then we get tracy to call him a ! I'd watch that.
 No no,you can't do race stuff on tv.
It's too sensitive.
 We would have done that on the mandrell sisters! Look,I want the show to be edgy too.
 I mean,but my boss,jack donaghy.
 let me talk to him.
 I am great with suits.
 No,we don't talk to him.
 Liz,you're not a cog in their machine.
 I know.
 I'm not some.
 follower.
 I just.
 we are very subversive on this show.
 Frank,what do you have this week? Uh,barry the humping dog is shopping for a ge washer and dryer.
 Have not seen that before.
 Sharp idea.
 Yo,I got the dogs outside.
 Well,bring them in! I feel sick to my stomach about dog fighting.
 But what can you do when they tell you not to? This could get ugly.
 What? No! You idiots! I built a dog fighting pit in my basement for this? Tracy.
 Can I speak with you privately? Tray,what's the one thing i asked you not to do? That 227 movie new jackee city? Dog fighting! What is it about your wiring that compels you to do exactly what you're asked not to? I don't know.
 Always been this way.
 Tracy,don't play with matches! You're not my dad! Tracy,don't stare directly at the sun.
It'll make you crazy.
 You're not my dad.
 Tracy,you're not going out the house dressed like that.
 You're not my dad.
 I'm beginning to think this has something to do with your dad.
 You're not my dad! You can't tell me what it's about.
 Hey,props gave me a bunch of dog penises for you to look at.
 Oh,great,thanks.
 Liz! Your grandmother is in jack's office.
 You better do something.
 Nana lemon?That's weird.
 Oh,no.
 Rosemary.
 Lemon,rosemary here was just telling me some of her fantastic sketch ideas.
 Liz,he totally gets it.
 He understands that what we do is far more important than what they do.
 I do.
I really do get it.
 Rosemary,thank you so very much.
 Oh,no,my pleasure.
 What a pleasure.
What fun catching up with you.
 You too.
 You take care now.
 You too.
 Fire her.
 And don't ever make me talk to a woman that old again.
 I can't fire rosemary.
 Yes,you can.
It's easy.
 Observe.
 Jonathan,you're fired! What? No! God,no! No,I won't fire her.
 It's mean.
 And I like her.
 And she's right,we should be pushing the envelope.
 Oh,god.
 Push the envelope.
 People who don't have the guts or the brains to work inside the system.
 Letter writers,radicals,howard dean.
 You just don't get her.
 You're like the talking mailbox.
 I'm going to assume that's a haldeman reference.
 In which case,I thank you.
 I got into this business to be like rosemary.
 To make people think.
 No.
 No no no,lemon.
 You got into this business because you're funny and you're weird and you're socially retarded.
 And you also got into it because it pays well,which means you are not like rosemary; you are like me.
 No,I'm not.
 You are a suit.
 You feed off the creativity and hard work of other people and turn it into commercials and pie charts and triangle graphs.
 What's a triangle graph? I don't know! It sounded real.
This is my show.
No,this is my show.
 And once a week I rent it out to the good people at the erectile dysfunction companies.
 Be that as it may,rosemary is my idol.
 And if you wanna get rid of her,then you will fire me also.
 suck it up,nerd.
 Oh,my god! Rosemary,that was such a rush standing up to jack like that.
 And I never would have done it if it weren't for you.
 I am so proud of you! He heard you roar and now things are gonna change around here.
 Jack says you're both fired.
 Yes! Hey tray,whatcha doing? Just some heavy thinking.
 This spotlight is the only place that I could go to get away from it all.
 You know,tray,I get this dad thing.
 I mean my father belongs in the smiling irish bastard hall of fame.
 And the pent.
 up,unresolved anger i have toward him,it still overwhelms me.
 You've got to learn to forgive.
 But how do I forgive someone that I don't know? Boy,if I could just talk to him once.
 Just once.
 Tracy,we're gonna do this together.
 You've got to get into therapy.
 I don't need therapy.
 I'm just mentally ill.
 Tracy,what if I told you that the one thing you cannot do is therapy? You're not my dad! We're doing therapy! All right,thank you.
 Good.
 bye.
 Kenneth,I may have made a mistake.
I was talking to donnie.
donnie? Head page donnie lawson,the king of sting? What did you do? I was just trying to make things right.
 Nice jacket,parcell.
 I hope that it and you will be very unhappy at cnbc for the next year.
 Of course,there is one other choice.
 A page.
 off.
 A page.
 off? It's a savage contest.
 Mixing physical stamina with nbc trivia.
 What's a page.
 off? You wanna page.
 off? I don't know what kind of corporate mind games he's playing.
 But if jack thinks i'm crawling back there.
 oh,screw him.
 But now that you're free,we can work on something together! Yeah,we can start our own network called bitch tv! Or the second idea that we think of.
 Look,when we get back to my place,we start banging out some ideas.
 Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life.
 What neighborhood is this? Oh,they call it little chechnya.
 So gritty and real.
 More murders per capita than detroit.
 Try not to write when you're living here.
 Is that guy carrying a gun? Yeah,but don't worry.
 He's not a cop.
 Hey,tracy,this is susanne hawker,the nbc therapist.
 Who's crazier,me or anne curry? Hello,tracy.
 Jack informed me of the talk you had earlier.
 And if you don't mind,I'd like to hop right in and start with some role play.
 Like my wife and I do? Cool.
 Donaghy,you play the matador.
 Uh,no,tracy.
 What I want you to do is talk to that empty chair as if your father were sitting there,okay? Man,this is stupid! Come on,tracy.
 We're here to help you.
 Uh,tracy,maybe it will help if jack sits in the chair and pretends to be your father.
 I wanna talk to you,son.
 You sound nothing like my dad.
 Well,where is he from? All I know is he's from funky north philly.
 He worked in a campbell's soup factory.
 And he had a droopy lip due to an unattended root canal.
 I think I can do this.
 Okay,go.
 I'm mad at you,dad.
 Hey,dummy! I'm mad at you too.
Uh,that's not exactly what I had in.
'cause you left me,dad! I was young and confused and your moms didn't want me around no more.
 Now,pass me them damn collard greens! Is this true,mom? He gambled away my welfare check.
 Woman,I got a mind to smack you upside the head.
Uh,this is not helpful.
Be me now.
 I only act out because I want your love! Dyn.
o.
mite! I think we're just doing good times now.
 Now do the white dude that my moms left my dad for.
 Uh,now,see here,tracy.
 It's impolite to slurp one's soup.
 Whoa,no need to resort to ugly stereotypes.
 You always gonna be my son.
 Tracy,just because i stopped loving your dad,doesn't mean we stopped loving you.
 Stop puttin' words in my mouth,woman! Oye,papi,kayate! People are sleeping! Mind your own damn business,mrs.
Rodriguez! All right,this is ridiculous.
 Lady,just because i'm an ignorant black man.
 And you paid me a nickel to bust up your chifforobe,doesn't give you the right to call me ridiculous just 'cause I'm proud of my son.
 They got me.
 The honkeys shot me.
 No,dad! Don't die! I love you,dad! I don't wanna dog fight no more! Tracy,that's it! That's it! Thank you for showing me there really is love in my family after all.
 And I need to stay the hell away from them.
 Donaghy,you're the only family I need,jackie D.
 You got that right,tray.
 You know,it's too bad you didn't know howard cosell when you were growing up.
 'Cause I had that one in my pocket the whole time.
 There we are.
 Oh,crapballs! What was that? Okay,let's find a pen and start that screenplay.
 This movie is gonna knock them on their asses.
 Right.
 What's it about? Women in their 50s go on spring break and get laid by a bunch of grateful 18.
year.
olds.
 Oh,god.
 Yeah,exactly.
 I predict opening weekend,a million dollars.
 Have you been drinking wine all day? Oh,it's heart healthy.
All day?Oh,come on,liz.
 It's the '90s! Did an f train just go by your window? I know that look.
 Don't even think about jumping for that train.
 You know,I think i should go home before it gets dark.
 You can't abandon me,liz.
 You are me.
 No,I'm not you.
 Really? You pick up guys that are smart and funny.
 You're never gonna get married,liz.
 You're married to your job.
 Oh,my god.
 I lost my job.
 You're just like me.
 You get up in the morning and smoke weed.
no,I don'T.
You obsess about the jamaican man across the hall.
 Oh,my god.
 I lost my job.
 You wouldn't have a job if it wasn't for me.
 I broke barriers for you.
 I really have to go.
 I sat around while my junk went bad.
 All for you.
 I didn't have any kids.
 You're my kid!You're my kid that never calls!yikes.
 Help me,liz lemon! You're my only hope! Okay,which nbc series spun off,among others,cosby,miami vice,cheers,and highway to heaven?Supercomputer!Oh,you're gonna do great! Ready! Page.
off,page.
off Come on,kenneth! You can do it! Hey! What the hell is going on down here? The phones are ringing off the hook,there's no one seating the conan audience! Get to back to work,you morons! Pete,wait.
 You don't understand.
 I ruined kenneth's jacket and he needs to get a new one,but can't have any demerits,so we have to have a page.
off.
 what,are you kidding me? This is a billion dollar company! Demerits? Donnie,give kenneth a damn jacket! This isn't over between us,moroney.
 You're in it now.
 It's finally over,ms.
Moroney.
 Yes.
 And it's hard to even remember how it all began.
 You burnt my jacket.
 All right,I need my job back.
 But this is not crawling,this is proud begging,like those kids that dance on the subway.
 Of course you can have your job back,lemon.
 Oh,thank god.
 It was terrible.
 I went to her apartment.
 I don't think she has a toilet.
 I saw my future,jack.
 Never go with a hippie to a second location.
 I can't end up like that.
 I have got to make money and save it.
 And I have to do that thing that rich people do where they turn money into more money.
 Can you teach me how to do that? With my eyes closed.
 Oh,good,because I want to send rosemary $400 a month for.
 forever.
 You should,that woman is unemployable.
 Rosemary says that women become obsolete in this business when there's no one left that wants to see them naked.
 You make enough money,you can pay people to look at you naked.
 To the future,lemon.
 Oh,and by the way,ge has a problem with the dog penis sketch.
 I'll change it.
 Hey,what about cat penises? Proudly Presents   

                




                    			Oh,hey,I,uh,I found your lipstick.
 Oh,no,this isn't mine.
 This is sunset blush.
 I wear tiger orgasm.
 But it was in my apartment.
 I don't know why I told you about the pop-tart.
 But that's weird.
 It's just me and pete at my place.
 Hello,ladies.
 Pete's having an affair.
 What? The lipstick,the spring in his step.
 The sexy justin timberlake hat.
 No,no,he's still married.
 I don't know what to tell you.
 The only reason men start taking care of themselves is if they're getting someone to have sex with them.
 If it wasn't for that,they'd just sit at home in their own filth.
 Hey,Liz.
 We're out of string cheese,so I think i'm gonna take off.
 What sketch is that for? It's not for a sketch.
 It's part of our new company-wide global eco initiative.
 We're going green,Lemon.
 And do you know why? To save the earth? So we can drain the remainder of its resources.
 Don Geiss is a genius.
 He's pitting all of the divisions of the company against each other to see who can make the most money from this environmentalism trend.
 And I am going to win with greenzo! Saving the earth while maintaining profitability.
 That's right,jared.
 Greenzo is america's first non-judgmental, business-friendly environmental advocate.
 The free market will solve global warming, if that even exists.
 My boy.
 Greenzo? Is that the first name that came to your head? Can you believe it? I mean,it just popped rightthere.
 proudly presents sync:ßÇÈâÈâ Rock Season02 Episode05 You're gonna be great,jared.
 I'm just so excited about this gig,sir.
 I mean,what a-- what a sweet gig.
 I've got a gig.
 Yeah,you're saying "gig" a lot.
 Oh,I'm so sorry.
 I haven't worked in a while.
 My last real job was an ad for rick lazio's new york senate campaign.
 Hillary clinton wants an all-homosexual army.
 How will that affect my family? Well,thankfully,those days are behind you.
 Your billboard's going up in times square.
 You're releasing an endangered falcon during halftime at the knicks game.
 And you're booked on the today show.
 Oh,wow,the today show! I just wish my mom were still alive so I could rub it in her fat face.
 Uh,come with me.
 He's having another party.
 Howdy.
 Hope you can make it.
 See ya there.
 What's up,Lemon? I'm hiding from Kenneth.
 I don't wanna get roped into another one of his terrible parties.
 I'm always the only person who shows up.
 Happy halloween,baby.
 How could no one go to ken's party? He's such a great dude.
 Will you come,please? No,I can'T.
 I only go to a-list events.
 Ohh,I don't wanna be stuck there alone with him again.
 Don't sweat it,'cause I'm gonna bail you out.
 I'm gonna turn ken's jam into a major event.
 Good luck with that.
 See,all a hot party needs is mystique.
 A buzz.
 See,people are like lemmings.
 Harvey lemmings,my lawyer,who never misses a party.
 That's not a real peon.
 You made that up.
 I just have to start a little rumor.
 Who are the biggest gossips on tgs? grizz and dotcom.
 So,greenzo,what else can kids and parents do to protect the environment? well,kids,you can tell your parents to buy a G.
E.
Front-loading washing machine to save water.
 'Cause if the earth's not here,where else is greenzo gonna dance? Thanks for getting the message out,greenzo.
 You're saving the world.
 Did you hear what mary said about me saving the world? Sorry,everybody,that's meredith viera.
 The today show wants to give us a recurring segment now.
 Lemon,I want you to write them up.
 I want the sketches to be punchy and entertaining, so don't treat it like your show.
 All right,but only because I like earth.
 Jared,we'll send you some stuff.
 Oh,I'd like to sit in and give notes.
 Make sure it's got that greenzo voice.
 It's wry and wise,but--but also very sexual.
 Walk with me,Lemon.
 Look how greenzo's testing.
 They love him in every demographic.
 Colored people,broads,fairies,commies.
 Gosh,we gotta update these forms.
 Yeah,well,greenzo seems to love himself too.
 So does don Geiss.
 He sent me a personal card congratulating me.
 With a real signature! Wow,if you licked the envelope,you could clone him, and then you'd have two Geisses.
 Yeah,right,Lemon.
 I'm gonna clone Geiss,then compete with a Geiss clone for the ceo position? Think it thr Ms.
Lemon,mr.
Donaghy,I'm just a simple pig farmer's son.
 But I would be honored if you'd come to a party at my home.
 Oh,whatever,fine.
 I'll come.
 Super.
 Mr.
D? Uh,no.
 I could make up some excuse,Kenneth, but I have too much respect for you.
 During your party,I'll be home,listening to some schubert.
 And,uh,ironically,viewing some canadian pornography.
 Hope you're ready to party like it's 1999.
 Which,according to my bible,will be in seven years.
 Oh,what is that smell? That is the body spray that came with my new leather Jacket.
 Oh,my god.
 Are you having an affair? What? No.
 Why would you say that? Because you're acting all happy and full of life.
 Liz,you're crazy.
 Yeah,and you're married,remember,pete? Your beautiful wife paula.
 And your sons,robert and Jack.
 And that creepy little one who's always rubbing himself against the carpet.
 Liz I'm not cheating on paula.
 You better not be! Oh,great,now I smell like midlife crisis! Here's a tip,cerie.
 Decide what you want before you open the refrigerator.
 You just released enough hydro fluorocarbons to kill a penguin.
 This penguin.
 You ever take off that costume? You ever take off yours? Greenzo out! Did he just talk to me like I'm ugly? Hey,fellas.
 I heard a secret about Kenneth's party.
 Ken went to high school in georgia with the rapper T.
I.
 And,boys T.
I.
Might show up.
 But listen we can't let anyone know.
 Anyone! Got it? Right.
 ****** ******* Never****** ****too I love***** we know ******** Dude******* ********* So******week ****** ******you I****** ******** I mean*******about it ******* Well,Kenneth is having this really,really big party.
 Yes,that's right,you heard me! T.
I.
Is gonna be at Kenneth's party! You're my publicist.
 Get me in! Oh,also,could you try to kill that story about my mom being meless? I love T.
I.
 Please,respect celebrity privacy.
 It's a party? Yes,but don't tell anybody.
 That was Geiss's social secretary.
 What did he say? He was talking about some epic party at Kenneth's! He claims he needs an invite for mr.
Geiss.
 You're saying Geiss might be at Kenneth's party? Our Kenneth? Yes! Why would he go to that? What else do you know? T.
I.
Is going to be there.
 Bob logan from texas instruments is gonna be there? Logan must be in contention for the ceo spot as well.
 Sir,if there's any chance that mr.
Geiss is going to be at this party Thanks,jonathan.
 Think I should try to go? I I've gotta find Kenneth.
 I,uh,haven't had a chance to get to that greenzo stuff yet.
 Hey,did you leave your computer on all night? Yeah,it just takes a really long time to reboot in the morning.
 Hey,you know what else takes a long time? Building a new earth.
 Listen,jared- greenzo.
 I'm working with you as a favor.
 You know what? You people make me sick.
 You act like you care,but you do nothing.
 Do you even bother to compost your own feces? Look,I got a lot of real work that I have to do right now.
 So I'm not really interested in having some actor lecture me.
 Are you saying actors can't change the world? I guess nobody bothered to tell sharon stone.
 Look,I always knew i can make a difference.
 And now I finally have my platform, so l's have a little less yappity yap and a little more kity clack.
 All right,that's it.
 I'm telling Jack.
 This is not working.
 Wait.
 What's in that styrofoam cup,huh? The earth's blood? Give me that.
 No.
 You jag! I just got this,like,eight years ago.
 Good job.
 Leave all the lights on for the invisible people.
 Gross! Liz! Paula? You're cheating with your wife? Why didn't you te me about this! That's my fault.
 I get off on the sneakin' around.
 Who knew,right? So how are your parents? No,no,no.
 We'll catch up later.
 I just came to get a clean sweater.
 Why is there a pop-tart in the bed? What do you do with the pop-tart? Hey,did you hear about Kenneth's insane party? T.
I.
'S gonna be there.
 I'm surprised to hear that because that is new information.
 Yeah,and he's gonna perform.
 He is? And fall out boy will be there too.
 And there's gonna be foxy boxing! Foxy boxing? I love foxy boxing! It combines my two favorite things: Boxing and referees! I got to get into that party man.
 Get me harvey lemmings! You dummy,first of all,you didn't dial that cell phone.
 Second of all,that is your own rumor.
 People are gonna show up expecting all this great stuff, and they're gonna be disappointed and angry.
 Just like colonial williamsburg.
 You need to nip this in the bud.
 Tell Kenneth what you've done and cancel the party.
 Kenneth,thanks for letting my cousins come to your party.
 I'm just horny to be in New York Hey,Kenneth,you know how much i like to joke around,right? Not really,mr.
Donaghy.
 Well,before,when I told you i didn't wanna come to your party, I was just kidding! Isn't that a fantastic joke? I don't understand what's happening.
 Well,the point is that I have good news.
 I may be able to stop by now.
 Oh,mr.
Donaghy,you don't wanna go to my silly party.
 so that's the way you wanna play this? Whip 'em out,measure 'em.
 Kenneth,as an executive vice president at general electric, I'm ordering you to give me one of those pink cupcakes.
 Ld love it if you came to my party.
 Yeah.
 You would.
 Sweet.
 Everyone's coming.
 You're just in time,Lemon.
 Greenzo's segment on the today show is about to begin.
 Yeah,I didn't write anything for that guy.
 He has gone off the deep end.
 You gotta replace hi don't mess with success,Lemon.
 Viewers love green Geiss loves greenzo.
 We're not changing anything.
 Hey,kids,can you hold your breath? Good.
 Now do it forever.
 'Cause the air is gonna be poisoned unless we switch to green technology.
 Sold by our company.
 I love this guy.
 You know,greenzo,I read that television sets actually draw power even when they're turned off.
 Meredith just taught us a very important lesson,kids.
 It's rude to interrupt people.
 Can greenzo get real here for a second? Did you know that there are people out there with the power to heal mother gaia, but they're paralyzed by greed? I'm talking about big companies and their two-faced,fat cat executives.
 What is he doing? Stay calm.
 Did you kids know that we could actually end global warming in five years, if we just raised taxes on the super-rich by just 2%? Wow,is that true? It doesn't matter if it's true.
 He works for that money.
 We've lost control of greenzo.
 I knew we should have gone with angie harmon.
 kill trees? Hey,Liz.
 Look,obviously what happened in your bed last night was a violation.
 So much hair.
 Sorry,she likes me natural.
 Listen,I am glad that you're back with paula.
 But when are you moving out? No,no,no,Liz.
 I can't move out.
 Look,paula and I got married our sophomore year.
 She was pregnant 20 minutes into the first date.
 This is the first chance we've had to just be a couple.
 And our relationship has never been better.
 We did it on your kitchen table.
 I shouldn't have told you that.
 Liz,please.
 Please let me be your roommate so I can date my wife.
 Oh,I can't believe i'm saying this.
 Okay.
 Yes! Oh,Liz,you're the best.
 Oh,hey,could you come home early tonight? Paula wants to get caught again.
 Got it.
 Hey,you catch me on today,Jack? Mary was totally digging me.
 Dude,have you hit that? Jared,I'm a little concerned that we're losing our message here.
 It's non-judgmental,business-friendly.
 Oh,no,no,no,no.
 We're way past that,Jack.
 While you're out there destroying the earth,I'll be saving it.
 And history will remember me.
 When I die,they'll wanna put my face on money.
 If there were money in the future instead of just hugs.
 Okay,you listen to me,redzo.
 You either get on board,or you're gonna wake up on that island with phil donahue and the electric car.
 You understand me? I made you what you are.
 No,I've always been greenzo.
 You're crazy.
 And you're fired.
 Really? Can you fire the wind,Jack? Can you fire a hurricane? We're developing that technology! hey,Liz,you going to Kenneth's party? Is this party still on? Oh,it better be.
 The harlem globetrotters are gonna be there.
 The girl from heroes is gonna take a shower.
 Now Jack is going to this party?This is nuts-- you said you were gonna shut it down.
 I couldn'T.
 This means too much to ken.
 And when everyone shows up and it sucks? It's not going to.
 This party's about to become a tracy jordan joint! And what does that entail? Here we go! I've called this meeting to discuss what happened last night at Kenneth's party.
 ******Kiss me.
 We all went in with certain expectations.
 The evening took a nasty left turn.
 Now we must face certain facts in the cold light of day.
 Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves.
 Mr.
Lutz,you ate all my parakeet's medication.
 And thanks to you,sonny crockett has been having seizures all morning.
 Mr.
Hornberger,I would thank you to come pick up your wife at some point.
 Mr.
Jordan,I saw you steal my sink.
 Harlem globetrotter does that name mean nothing to you? And ms.
Lemon.
 I will have you know that before last night, I had never,ever seen grizz or dotcom cry.
 I'm sorry.
 I want you all to think about what you did.
 Congratulations.
 You were all present at Kenneth parcell's last party ever.
 Mr.
Donaghy,uh they are ready for you downstairs.
 I'm gonna,uh need a moment.
 What is this for? The today show was expecting another green segment.
 Don Geiss is expecting it.
 It's gonna happen.
 But you fired jared,so who's gonna oh,my god.
 That's al gore.
 Is he gonna be the new greenzo? Uh,not exactly.
 I may have gotten him here under false pretenses.
 Hey,Jack,good to see you again.
 Mr.
Vice president.
 Hi,how are you? I'm Lemon.
 So I'm excited to see this trash-powered car of yours.
 How do you two even know each other? We met when Jack was an intern for senator ted kennedy.
 Let me tell ya,Jack was the most liberal guy-- The thing is,the G.
E.
Garbage car isn't quite ready yet.
 But while you're here,what do you say you throw on a pair of green tights and a cape, and tell the kids how big business is good for the environment? I have no interest in doing that.
 Al,we're with you on this whole planet thing.
 I mean,look at the set we built with the smiley-face earth and some green things.
 Jack,look,we're way beyond that.
 If your network really wants to demonstrate a commitment to the environment, why don't you start by,for example, having an entire week with nothing but environmental themes on all the programs? Use entertainment for substance.
 You could have a character in prime time making a passionate argument to the american people that we need co2 taxes to replace the payroll taxes.
 Your parent company could lobby congress and the president to pass the treaty and save the climate.
 Yes,or you could put on a silly hat and tell the kids how outsourcing means cheaper toys at christmas.
 This is not working for me,Jack.
 All right,let's do this! Jared,what are you doing here? Al gore? What's up? Jared,it's time for you to go.
 No,no! The show must go on! Back off,Jack! Or you'll be greenzoed! You'll all be greenzoed! Jared! Jared! I--I am so sorry,mr.
Vice president.
 This all started when Jack- Quiet! A whale is in trouble.
 I have to go.
 Give it to me Oh,boy,okay.
 This earth is ruined!We gotta get a new one.
   

                




                    			are you makin' waffles? No,quiet.
 Somebody is,and the maple syrup smells delicious.
 jack russell terrier? no,I can't get a dog.
 you should.
 A dog'll change your life.
 Hey,I just wanted to make sure you're practicing your rerun dance for the what's happening sketch.
 I'm trying,liz lemon,but I can't concentrate.
 Somebody on my block is making waffles,and it's makin' me horny! Wait,you smell maple syrup too? You live all the way in jersey.
 That's weird.
 Hold on.
 Hello? Do you smell maple syrup? Yes! Don't panic,lemon.
 It's probably not a chemical attack.
 What do you mean "probably"? It's probably just a strange wind pattern coming off those factories in staten island, where food flavors are made.
 I don't think it's northrax.
 What's northrax? It's a chemical agent we sold to the saudis in the 1980s.
 It smells exactly like maple syrup.
 But I don't think this is it.
 Well,how do you know? Because northrax kills you within ten seconds.
 Okay,I'll talk to you tomorrow.
 proudly presents sync:ßÇÈâÈâ Rock Season02 Episode06 Make me look like this.
 Right,like that's a stretch.
 Hey,jack,thanks for that call last night.
 I get really nut burgers over this homeland security stuff.
 Always check with me first,lemon.
 I have nsa connections.
 Good.
 Didn't you just get a haircut two days ago? I get my haircut every two days.
 After all,your hair is your head suit.
 I'm going to a party tonight honoring robert novak.
 It's being thrown by john mccain and john bauer.
 Um,I don't think he's real.
 Oh,I assure you,lemon,john mccain is very real.
 I have to look perfect.
 When it comes to hair,no one is more bitchy than conservative males.
 Good lord,donaghy.
 Did you comb your hair with a chicken bone? They can be brutal.
 Well,have fun.
 Don't get peer pressured into invading iran.
 Oh,uh,before you go,I'd like you to put this on.
 Sheinhardt wig company? What's this? A way to show support for our parent company, which is having a little p.
R.
Hiccup right now.
 NOT POISONING RIVERS SINCE 1997 All right.
 Thanks.
 Picked up your tuxedo from the cleaners,mr.
Donaghy.
 Just like you asked.
 Thank you,kenneth.
 Let me just take this plastic off.
 'Cause I saw on martha stewart how we're all doing everything wrong.
 Where are the pants? Sweet peaches! What have I done? Somewhere along the way,they must have slipped out the bottom.
 It's all right,kenneth.
 These things happen.
 Uncle butch was right.
 I'm just a stupid country bumpkin with great skin and soft hands.
 I'll just have jonathan bring over another pair.
 No,sir.
 This is my mistake.
 I will replace your pants.
 They cost $2,500.
 I will find your pants! All right! My prescription shampoo! who is it? Hi,I have your mail.
 I live across the hall.
 H- hi,I didn't even realize anyone had moved in over here.
 Welcome.
 I'Mliz.
 What's your name? Raheem.
 Raheem.
 That's- that's my mother's name.
 No,it- no,I'm just kidding.
 Give me my package,please.
 okay.
 Well,it was nice to meet coming up next,candace van der shark,a lifetime intimate portrait.
 Have you met the guy across the hall? Raheem? Yeah,he's a good egg.
 He's weird.
 He wouldn't shake my hand.
 And I think it's because i'm a woman.
 And get this-he's got maps all over his walls.
 Maps.
 Maps? You mean like that one? That's different,that's- that's an antique.
 And I'm a white lady.
 What are you saying there,liz? Pete,you know me.
 I never make assumptions about race.
 Remember,I asked that black guy if he had seen sideways? But this guy I don't like him.
 You're being paranoid.
 Raheem is a really nice guy.
 And he's always helping.
 He rewired the toaster oven,and he showed me a back way to the airport.
 Listen to yourself,pete.
 I don't want to sound racist,but that pita pocket might be a terrorist.
 That sound racist? this rich chestnut color is natural? Excuse me.
 Whiskey,straight up.
 I'll have a white rum with diet ginger ale and a splash of lime.
 Wow,I never would have pegged you for a university of tennessee sorority girl.
 Well,you've got to pace yourself with these things.
 We go all night.
 That's good advice.
 Unfortunately,I promised bill frist the next slow dance.
 I'm C.
C.
 Jack.
 Nice haircut.
 Sir,here's your nancy drew.
 For men,it's called a hardy boy.
 Hey,kk,how's it hangin'? Very low,sir.
 Very low.
 I lost something real important.
 You know what I do when I lose something? I yell real loud until I find it.
 So what is it that you lost? Pants.
 Pants!Pants!Pants!Pants!Pants!Pants! How 'bout the sean johns? Were you chafing again,tray? I don't think that's gonna help me find mr.
Donaghy's pants.
 Well,did you retrace your steps? Or go back to the drycleaners? Yes,obvious twins.
 And I tried looking in the last place you'd ever expect.
 And,no,mr.
Donaghy's pants are not in the ladies' room at that laser tag place on 12th avenue.
 It's no use.
 I'm just gonna have to replace 'em.
 But where am i ever gonna get $2,500? Well,why don't you just do like I do and sell your autograph at the car show? * What the worid needs now is love * * sweet love it's the only thing that * * there's just too little of * * what the worid needs now * What the what? IF YOU SEE SOMETHING,SAY SOMETHING IF YOU SUSPECT ANYTHING,DO EVERYTHING WE DON'T POISON THE WORLD.
TERRORISTS DO.
 Thank you for an incredible night.
 Really? Did you have a good time? 'Cause I really did.
 Unbelievably good.
 And thank you for letting me try the thing I tried.
 I'M sorry I dropped you.
 Oh,no,it was great.
 I mean,who knew that ottoman had wheels,right? Well,I gotta get to work.
 Uh,when can i see you again? Anytime.
 You name it.
 congressman cunningham,it is a pleasure to have you on our program.
 Hi,dan.
 Thank you for having me.
 Celeste cunningham.
 C.
C.
 You didn't tell me you're a congresswoman! I just ended my first year.
 but also on some of your constituents.
 "D"? Vermont? Big business is out to get us again.
 The sheinhardt wig company has dumped thousands of gallons of auburn fantasy dye #260 into the chickotagua river, turning the children of chickotagua orange.
 And I will not rest until this company and all of its subsidiaries are held financially responsible! Why do you have this? I run a sheinhardt wig subsidiary called nbc.
 Oh,my god.
 You're jack donaghy? What were you even doing at that party last night? Oh,my god.
 This was a mistake.
 Forget about what I said.
 I can never be seen with you again.
 You're right.
 We have to pretend that this never happened.
 Yeah,I have to get out of here.
 Damn it,the worst part is I really liked you a lot.
 I gave her the ottoman,and she walked out.
 Sir,I typed up that letter.
 Hey,uh what do you need,lemon? Nothing,I just,uh it can wait.
 Lemon,there's nothing you could say to me that you can't say in front of jonathan.
 I think my middle eastern neighbor is a terrorist,and I don't know what to do.
 That's ridiculous,lemon.
 Some of our greatest patriots have been of middle eastern descent.
 And I'm appalled to hear you engage in racial profiling like that.
 I'm kidding.
 Be an american-call it in.
 This is the number of a friend of mine in a very high-level position at homeland security.
 Oh,no,not- now I don't know.
 Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
 If a bleeding heart liberal like you has any suspicions I know,right? Nice ring tone,jack.
 That's not my ring tone.
 I hate that san francisco sound.
 How am I calling myself? This isn't even my phone.
 Jack? C.
C.
? I think I have your phone.
 Yeah,you must have grabbed it by accident.
 After our night of doing it.
 Take the freight elevator to the sixth floor,and I'll be right down.
 are you all right? Well,last night I never mind.
 These verizon wireless phones are just so popular.
 I accidentally grabbed one belonging to an acquaintance.
 Well,sure,'cause that verizon wireless service is just unbeatable.
 I mean,if I saw a phone like that on tv, I would be like,"where is my nearest retailer so I canget one?" Can we have our money now? Come on big money.
 This ketchup expired two years ago.
 Dude,how much would I have to pay you to eat this whole bottle? Honestly? I got all the way to harlem when I heard wagner coming from my phone.
 Harlem? I'm working out of the clinton offices for a few weeks.
 I'm helping hillary retool her universal health care platform.
 God,I wanna kiss you on the mouth to stop you from saying such ridiculous things.
 Here's your phone.
 Obviously,we can never be seen together again.
 Obviously-I'm up for the chairmanship,and I don't wanna risk that.
 They give you a helicopter,you know.
 What about me? How can I look those little orange children in the eye? They have no other documented health problems,you know.
 They're orange! This is why I got into politics- to stop big companies from hurting the little guy.
 What happened to you that made you this way? In 1998,I got shot in the face by my neighbor's dog.
 Oh,C.
C.
,I'm so- wait,what? My neighbor had a riverton hunting rifle with a faulty trigger safety.
 One day,his jack russell terrier started chewing the area, the gun went off,and shot me in the face.
 No.
 A terrier? So I did what was right: I sued riverton,my neighbor,and the dog.
 C.
C.
,I'm so sorry.
 Well,don't be.
 After six reconstructive surgeries, I'm much better-looking now than I used to be.
 Plus,they made a lifetime movie about me.
 tonight on lifetime,candace van der shark stars as celeste cunningham A dog took my face and gave me a better face to change the worid: The celeste cunningham story You know,I thought you made love like an ugly girl.
 So present,so grateful.
 Who's that? Nobody.
 Don't lie to me,jack.
 I've had plenty of women mad at me the morning after.
 Just don't let her light your sneakers on fire in the bathtub.
 Oh,she would never do that,tracy.
 She's a very special woman.
 So then what's the problem? Well,we're just on opposite sides of a feud.
 Oh,I get it: Romeo and juliet.
 Capulets and romulans.
 Mm-hmm,I've been there.
 I'm black,she's white.
 I'm black,she's light-skinned black.
 I'm black,she's 17.
 Hey,listen,if she's your soul mate,you go for it.
 Tracy,I don't believe in soul mates.
 I worked too hard to get where I am to sacrifice it for some woman.
 I don't care if she is beautiful,brilliant, and she does it like her dad's a minister.
 Sir,that was impressive! My feet are puffed up real bad.
 Dude,let us give you the rest of the money for donaghy's pants.
 No,mr.
Rossitano.
 We parcells are neither wealthy nor circumcised,but we are proud.
 I have to earn that money.
 All right,I got a job for you.
 Every night after dinner,lutz falls asleep on the couch in our office.
 Can I help you? Pete!Pete! Pete! Raheem! Ready to go? You guys are going out? Yeah.
 My buddy,raheem,invited me out with him to celebrate.
 He just completed some big project he's been working on.
 Soon everyone will know the name raheem haddad.
 Hi,I'm not sure,but- who is he,and where can we find him? Hey,C.
C.
 We're having a barbecue tonight.
 You're welcome to come.
 Thanks.
 Maybe I will.
 Get the gun away from the dog.
 Hey,hon,have you seen my hunting rifle? Last time I saw it the dog had it.
 What is wrong with you people? I'm going to get into politics! Got him! Ape attack! Ape attack.
 Smarts! Are you okay? Okay,that went too far.
 I still need $700.
 What's next? You know that old lady in accounting who thinks you're her husband who died in the war? What about her? I do believe in destiny.
 And I know that i should hate you,but I can'T.
 I love you.
 And I don't care what people say.
 We were meant to be in each other's lives.
 You're right,C.
C.
 Some dudes took raheem last night.
 sounds like an american hero saw something and said something.
 Elizabeth lemon,I can't believe you did that.
 Raheem is a good guy! You seem to be defending raheem an awful lot.
 I'd hate to have to make another phone call.
 No,we're cool.
 Uh,I renounce raheem.
 Raheem's a bad guy.
 Usa number one! Tracy,I need your help.
 I've gotta go somewhere,and I can't be seen,and cabs don't go there.
 Sure,where is it? Clinton's office in harlem.
 I know where that building is.
 I get my jamaican meat pies there.
 Finally,my scalp rx.
 I know you are in the media.
Please get this in the right hands.
Raheem Oh,my god.
 I am raheem haddad.
 And this is my brother hakim.
 And these are the reasons you should choose us to be the next contestants on the amazing race! Amazing what? THE AMAZING RACE**** We love to travel.
 Look at all the places we have been: Toronto,munich,london,the hoover dam,the cleve.
 Oh,boy.
 we are in good shape for the road blocks and detours.
 Come on,go! Oh,no,oh,no.
 we love america! Oh,no.
 Oh,no.
 jonathan I purchased a replacement pair of mr.
Donaghy's pants.
 You must love him as much as I do.
 C.
C.
,Look out the window onto 125th street.
 You shouldn't be here.
 I know I shouldn'T.
 I can't help myself.
 I wanna be with you! Tell her you want your privates and her privates to do a high-five.
 Okay,tray,I got this.
 Jack,we hardly know each other.
 This could be career suicide for both of us,and you know it! I don't care anymore.
 I saw your movie- what you said to that dog about soul mates.
 I think I might be the dog.
 Tell her her butt look like a apple and you wanna take a bite.
 Buzz me in,okay? Tell her she got some tig ol' biddies like the dallas cowboy cheerleaders.
 Tell her you want her to donate her body to science,and you science.
 Tell her,jack! I've been going crazy these last few days,thinking about our night together.
 How you wanted to brush my hair as foreplay.
 How you made me that western omelet at 4:00 A.
M.
 I never met anyone like you,jack.
 Be with me,C.
C.
 We'll ignore our differences till the sex goes bad,then we'll walk away bitter and angry.
 Nobody can know we're together.
 Not even your friend tracy jordan out there.
 I don't think you have to worry about tracy.
 Stop eatin' people's old french fries,pigeon.
 Have some self-respect.
 Don't you know you can fly? I don'T I've never had a secret affair before.
 What do you say we go find a spot and defile this place? Raheem.
 Hey,buddy! Where ya been all week? They put electrodes on my testicles,liz.
 Who did? Oh,you remembered my name.
 America's government shocked my nuts.
 No,I'm pretty sure they're not allowed to do that type of thing.
 They say,"raheemwhy you no shake hands?" I say,"because I don't want sickness before amazing race.
" They say,"raheem,why all the trips to the airport?" I say,"because I'm practicing for the amazing race!" And then,"zzt!Zzt!" In my underpanties! Do you have any idea who turned you in? No but I am just so angry now.
 I have so much anger inside.
 I want to do something spectacular with it.
 Northrax.
 Hey! I made waffles.
 thank god.
 Yeah.
   

                




                    			Liz, Lutz and I are gonna walk around Times Square and pretend to be foreign.
 I am from Homburg, yah.
 Wanna come? Oh, I can't.
 My cousin is in town.
 All right.
 See ya though.
 Liz, I'm getting drinks with recently-divorced camera guy.
 You in? Legally separated sound guy's gonna be there.
 I-I don't feel well.
 Okay.
 Hey, Liz Lemon.
 I'm going to an animals-only strip club.
 Interested? Does that meane animals strip, or the animals are the customers? Animal customers? That's ridicous.
 Well, um, I have got a date.
 So I yeah.
 Order, please.
 Hi, order for pick-up.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Yes, I would like a meatball sub with extra bread.
 And my name is-- Liz? Yeah, that's me.
 Okay.
 Big night, Lemon? Let me guess.
 Meatball sub, extra bread.
 Bottle of NyQuil.
 TiVo top chef.
 A little Miss Bonnie Raitt.
 Lights out.
 No, I have something to do tonight, Jack.
 Then you won't mind when I tell you that, uh Casey gets voted off tonight.
 You monster! Why are you like this? sync:ßÇÈâÈâ corrected Sir, Tracy's here with a bunch of kids.
 He wants to know if you have a minute to meet with them? Absolutely not.
 J.
D.
! There he is.
 I want you to meet the baseball team I'm coaching.
 A group of fine young men and one special lady.
 Dijonaise is a boy's name? Pardon me.
 Tracy, this is wonderful.
 I had no idea you were interested in baseball.
 I wasn't.
 My motorcycle hit a police horse.
 This is community service.
 These kids come from Knuckle Beach, the worst neighborhood in New York.
 They are poor as hell.
 Baseball is a wonderful sport, boys.
 I remember when my high school team won the Boston city championship.
 Everyone told us we were gonna lose, because our team was all white, and the other team was completely-- anyway, we won, and I learned that anything is possible.
 Baseball taught me how to win.
 Baseball taught me how to dream.
 What are your dreams? When I grow up, I'm gonna do vending machine maintenance.
 I'm gonna get shot by a cop and sue the city.
 I'm a be a talkative doorman with a drinking problem.
 That's right.
 You shoot for the stars.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 These are not the dreams of winners.
 These aren't winners.
 They're 0 and 17.
 Damn, we supposed to be at the game right now.
 That one's on coach Tracy.
 Someday I'll have an office like this to clean.
 You could have an office like this of your very own.
 All you need is someone to point you in the right direction.
 A role model.
 Like R.
 Kelly and Michael Vick.
 Faves.
 Thanks.
 There you go.
 Uh, grandy? Oh, my God.
 Who ordered the veal? Am I right, guys? Ugh, Jenna, that guy is a baby.
 Uh, Lutz? I'm Lutz.
 You ordered a Venti chocolate mocha blast with half and half and brownie chunks? Thank you.
 Jamie.
 I like your blond streaks.
 It's very Simon LeBon.
 Who? Oh, you're young.
 Give it up, Jenna.
 You're talking to an ultrasound.
 Now I'm getting attitude from the sexy librarian over here.
 What? Sexy? You are.
 Shut up.
 Wow, that guy is adorable.
 Frank's gay.
 Maybe I am gay for that little peach.
 You wanna kiss him? I do.
 I wanna kiss him on the mouth.
 And hold him.
 What are you talking about? Something just happened, Liz.
 Come on, you read Boobs magazine.
 I want Jamie.
 Yeah, you're gay.
 He's totally gay for-- Why isn't this any fun? come on! Gather 'round!Circle up! Everybody, circle up! All right, circle up.
 Circle up.
 Around me! Around me! All right, isten, that's enough.
 There's a weird dude standing over there.
 And I don't wanna get shot today, so great hustle, great practice.
 Okay, the weird dude is gone.
 Go home.
 Hey, you guys! It's that king we met.
 Good afternoon, boys.
 I've been thinking a lot about you, and I decided that I wanna help.
 Starting with some new uniforms.
 Compliments of the Sheinhardt wig company.
 You wanna be a bunch of winners? You've gotta dress for success.
 That's why I sponsor a charity that gives away tuxedos to homeless people.
 It was a beautiful ceremony.
 Mazel tov.
 That's right.
 Put them on.
 You don't get these kids, Jack.
 They don't care about winning.
 They just wanna be able to go outside for once.
 You know, our first practice they asked me what the sun was? Hey, Jamie! Did you just come from working out, or are you naturally veiny? Pull it together, Frank.
 All right.
 Okay.
 Good to see you, man! Thanks.
 So I don't want to interrupt or anything, But, um, are you doing anything saturday night? Just gellin' like Magellan.
 Okay, well.
 Uh, my friend's DJing at this gallery opening, and, um, he can get us in if you wanna go.
 Oh, no, I don't think so.
 Oh, come on.
 It'll be fun.
 Jamie, how old do you think I am? I don't know.
 Uh, 29? Wow, you are good at guessing ages.
 I am exactly 29, but you're a baby.
 No, I'm not.
 I'm 25.
 Really? Yeah.
 I thought you were younger.
 And I'm 29, so so you'll go? Awesome.
 Dude.
 I totally forgot.
 I bought you a sweater.
 It's slim fitting.
 They call it a French cut.
 And it wasn't on sale or anything.
 Woe, thanks.
 Do you need help trying it on? No.
 So I'll pick you up around 10:00? At night? Okay.
 That sounds great.
 Great.
 Where are we going? Frank.
 Stop it.
 I can't.
 I'm gay for Jamie.
 No, that's not a thing.
 You can't be gay for just one person, unless you're a lady, and you meet Ellen.
 Well then, I got some real thinking to do.
 It's scary.
 But also exciting.
 I can't believe I did that.
 I told myself I would never lie about my age.
 These things happen, Liz.
 I had my "No sex with Asians" rule, but then one day you walk into Sharper Image, and there's Quan.
 Forget it.
 I'm gonna order some more coffee, and then he'll come back, and I can cancel.
 No, this is a good thing.
 A hot guy thinks you're 29.
 He is cute.
 He looks like Zac Efron.
 That's a thing, right? Oh, go for it, Liz.
 I always roll with it when hot guys think I'm 22.
 What can we do? We're cougars.
 We're what? Cougars.
 Hot older ladies pouncing on their young prey.
 There was a whole article about it in Vanity Fair.
 The one with the Crisis In Africa cover.
 God, it makes me so sad that more people don't know about cougars.
 Why am I looking for something to wear in wardrobe? Why don't you go to Abercrombie and Fitch? Oh, no.
 It's too loud in there.
 No, don't say that.
 Cougars have to act young.
 You should get a ring pop to suck on.
 What are you doing? Figuring some stuff out.
 Sorry, Jenna, I'm probably gay now.
 It's never gonna happen between us.
 You wanted to see me? Hello, coach.
 I thought we'd have a little meeting before today's practice.
 Practice? Meetings? What is this? A marriage? Phil Jackson likes to give books to his players to inspire them, so which biography of Winston Churchill do you think would improve Rashid's bunting? Jack, have you ever been to Knuckle Beach? It's a totally different world.
 A world where orange soda's an acceptable substitute for breast milk.
 Tracy, I don't have to understand their world in order to help them.
 It's like this great country of ours.
 We can go into any nation, impose our values, and make things better.
 It's what Bush is doing all over the globe.
 Bush! Now, I don't wanna go off on a rant here.
 So I suppose the next step would be to bring our superior resources to bear.
 Kenneth, show him the drawing of the new field.
 Sorry.
 This is my dream journal.
 They've all come true so far.
 FUN TIMES ACCOMPLISHED What the heck is going on out here? You didn't get behind grounders.
 You didn't work the pitch count.
 There was nothing Churchillian about that performance.
 And where are their uniforms? You can't wear blue in Knuckle Beach, which is hard because jeans go with everything.
 Tracy, your failure of leadership is unacceptable.
 Now you gonna blame this on me? I told you this was gonna happen.
 Extly.
 I need somebody who believes in what we're doing here.
 Tracy, you're fired.
 Kenneth, you're in charge.
 So you like the music? Yeah, speaking of music I like, how about Gnarls Barkley, huh? That guy's great.
 Have you been to his official website? It's really-- Oh God, is it only 1:00 am? Yeah, so after this I figure we hit up Marquee.
 They only serve drinks till 4:00, but I can get us into this great after-hours club in Brooklyn.
 I'm 37.
 What? I'm 37.
 Please don't make me go to Brooklyn.
 I'm 20.
 Oh, boy.
 This just went from a senior dating a freshman to Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Fualaau.
 Are those friends of yours? Or Oh, when will death come? Lemon, what happened, did you take an Ambien with your Franzia and sleepwalk here? No, I am out on a date.
 I know you.
 You deliver my coffee.
 You're here with Lemon? Yes, sir.
 I'm Jamie, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Oh, what a polite young man.
 Ooh, they just changed bartenders.
 I'm gonna go see if this guy'll serve me.
 Where did you two meet, an amber alert? I just found out that he's I knew I shouldn't have done this.
 I look ridiculous.
 Oh, nonsense.
 You've never looked better.
 Do I look ridiculous when you see me with a younger woman? Boy, the art in here is hung really level.
 A youthful companion is the ultimate status accessory.
 Well, maybe you can pull that off.
 You're a man.
 It's different for women.
 That is so sexist of you.
 To that clueless boy over there, you're a very powerful woman.
 Technically you're a catch.
 You've got money, status, naturally thick hair, a decent set.
 All right.
 Tell me, have you been on a date since Floyd? No.
 Why are you so against having fun in your life? I'm not against fun.
 I went up on my roof the other day.
 Stop fighting this.
 He's hot, poor, and eager to please.
 Just buy him a few gifts and never give him your home phone number.
 And if you set a curfew, stick to it.
 Oh, gosh.
 Okay.
 Hey, coach.
 How did practice go today? Sir, conditions have deteriorated.
 I made DeMarquis captain like you said.
 But having a kid from Trinidad in charge made the latinos real mad.
 And they all seem to really hate my grandpa.
 'Cause they keep yelling, "Kill, whitey.
" And I'm, like,"what do you think you are, alcohol?" All right, Kenneth, calm down.
 There was bound to be some unrest once we removed Tracy.
 They're testing our resolve.
 Stay the course.
 Kenneth! Mr.
 Jordan.
 About what happened-- I don't wanna talk about it, Ken.
 You'll hear all I have to say about Jack Donaghy in my tell-all book, betrayal, colon, what really happened with my baseball team, comma, disaster at Knuckle Beach, question mark.
 What the hell is going on? It's chaos, sir.
 They've turned on each other.
 And they won't listen, especially when I'm saying, "Don't hit me with my own shoes.
" I think things may have been better under Mr.
 Jordan.
 We're not gonna look back now, Kenneth.
 Tracy didn't understand what needed to be done.
 He had to go.
 They're destroying all the things I bought for them.
 Everything but the bats, sir.
 Oh, god.
 They see us.
 You kids put those bats down! For the love of God.
 Oh, Liz.
 Did I see you saturday at Marquee? I was there.
 Yes.
 So what were you doing there? Is it like that time they found my grandpa at the bus station? No, I was there with Jamie, the coffee guy.
 And we had a great time.
 Coffee guy? That'll really make your ex-husband jealous.
 Cerie, for the last time, I have never been married.
 That's the spirit! Hey, Liz.
 This is Aidan.
 Guess you're not the only cougar in town.
 Aidan's a freshman at nyu.
 Aren't you, Aidan? Sure.
 Do you have any change for a soda? But you just had one.
 Whatever.
 Don't you whatever me.
 Hey, hey, what did I say about you wearing your heelies inside? Aidan! Wait up, Aidan.
 There she is.
 The cradle robber.
 Yeah, that's right.
 I have a boy toy, and we look awesome together.
 That's great, Maude.
 How's Harold? His name is Jamie.
 And you know what? I don't spend a lot of time worrying about his feelings.
 I just know he's super-cute, and he laughs at all my jokes.
 Coffee's here.
 Hey there! I had fun the other night.
 Your roof is awesome.
 Oh, thanks.
 I go up there all the time.
 So, uh, you wanna get some lunch? Oh, I can't.
 I have a lot of work to do.
 Okay.
 'Cause I already got Randy to cover my shift.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 But I bought you a video game.
 Bioshock? No way! Hey, chatterbox.
 I thought I heard your voice.
 How was your weekend? It was great.
 Liz and I-- I made you a painting.
 It's called one-armed mermaid that's part unicorn with big foot.
 Thank you.
 Are we still on for tomorrow night? Yeah, I can't wait.
 No, he can't.
 We're working out.
 I'll see ya tomorrow night.
 Yeah, I'll take it.
 Thank you.
 Liz, be good to him.
 What do you want, Jack? Tracy, I wanna talk to you.
 It's hard for me to admit when I've made a mistake so I won't.
 Mr.
 Jordan, I have made a terrible mistake.
 Because of my arrogance, the team is now in chaos.
 Pedro and Fontanelle quit because I tried to put them in the outfield.
 Of course they did! They're afraid to go north of 245th street.
 Next you'll be telling me you let Reshon have contact with his birth mother.
 Which Reshon? Jack, I told you, you did not know what you were getting yourself into.
 Tracy, I only wanted to help.
 And now things are out of control.
 We have two options.
 One, we can cut and run and betray the people that we made this commitment to, or you and I can form a coalition.
 No way, JD.
 Tracy, I thought you cared about these kids.
 Just because I don't support Jack donaghy, doesn't mean I don't support the kids.
 But sir, every one of them wrote you a letter asking you to come back.
 Jack.
 If I come back to the team, can I throw these things away and not have to read 'em? Tracy, I'll pay somebody to read them for you.
 With your know-how and my resources, we can turn these kids into winners.
 All right, Jack.
 What's the plan? One word: Surge.
 That's two words! Jamie Look, Jamie, I can't take this sam and diane thing anymore.
 I need to know what we're doing here.
 Nothing, Frank.
 I'm not gay.
 I'm not gay either.
 That's why it's perfect.
 We're just two straight guys who wanna enjoy each other's bodies.
 I gotta go.
 Damn, I can't believe we're winning.
 I knew the surge would work.
 Way to go, Manuel! That one goes out to W.
S.
Churchill.
 Hey, there's no way that those batters were born after 1993.
 These dominican birth certificates say otherwise.
 Esteban! You're up.
 This is just embarrassing.
 You look nice.
 Oh, thank you.
 Oh, I got you that leather bracelet that you were looking at.
 Oh, that's so ill.
 Thank you.
 It is ill.
 All right, we should get going because we're gonna be late.
 No we won't, baby.
 We're takin' a cab.
 Really? I've never been in a cab with less than seven people.
 Well, stick with me.
 I will.
 Look at us.
 We look awesome together.
 Yeah, now I know why demi moore does this.
 I get that reference.
 All right, mom.
 I'm takin' off.
 Mom? Yeah, I'm 20.
 I can't afford this place.
 All right, honey, have a good time.
 I'm beth.
 Yep, that's what we look like.
 Shut it down.
 Oh, hey, Jamie.
 That is so awkward now.
 Oh, don't worry about it.
 You had your fun.
 But the end was humiliating.
 Of course it was.
 All may-december relationships end in humiliation, sexual incompatibility, social faux pas, meeting their parents, it's classic.
 I'm not sure it's worth it.
 Don't be silly.
 Jamie was good for you.
 A younger companion makes you feel more alive.
 Opens you up to new experiences.
 Fresh points of view.
 Stimulating conversation.
 Stop repeating what I say-- stop repeating what I say.
 Look, Aidan, I swear to God-- Look, Aidan, I swear to God.
 You know what? This is over.
 You know what? This is over.
 Of course, there are some exceptions.
 Thank God I'm off the market.
 Oh, are you seeing someone? What? No.
 I mean this company is my girlfriend.
 She gives me all the loving I'll ever want or need.
 That's gross, Jack.
 Stop hitting yourself, Jenna! Oh, God! Why are you like this? Guys! This isn't working! I'm not gay-gay.
 I'm just gay for Jamie.
 Frank, I don't think that's a thing.
 It is.
 Look, you dudes are great, a lot of fun to dance with, and you smell awesome.
 Enjoy your night.
 Bye, sexy bear! Terence! You make us all look so bad.
   

                




                    			Oh, are you sure this is a good idea? What if someone sees us? Don't worry, it's too early for the creative types.
 And I sent my assistant to a nonexistent italian bakery out in queens.
 This is the address he gave me.
 He never makes mistakes.
 I can't go back there without sfogliatelle! We can't keep sneaking around, jack.
 It's too dangerous.
 I'm trying to get the united states government to sue your parent company.
 Take off your pantsuit.
 Right back at ya.
 Workplace! lemon, you're here early.
 Well, I gave up caffeine, so I've been going to bed at 5:30.
 But I will leave now.
 oh, don't be silly.
 Uh, liz lemon, I'd like you to meet a business associate of mine.
 Uh, lakeesha.
.
 gurez.
.
arafat.
 I like your necklace.
 Oh, thanks.
 It's actually a rape whistle.
 But the whistle part fell off, and I just liked how it looked, so I.
.
 Kept it.
 I will leave you to it.
 It being business.
 Of course.
 I call the movie risky business risky "it" because "it" means business.
 Lemon out.
 proudly presents sync:ßÇÈâÈâ Rock Season02 Episode08 *******lunch *******work Not now*** And******you ******time is******kids Kids wait*****here ***** Take that off.
 You didn't go to harvard.
 I went to harvard.
 I did standup there this weekend.
 Very funny.
 You were not graduated from that institution.
 Well, I got a squeezer from an indian girl on a bunk bed.
 So I think I got the full harvard experience.
 That does sound pretty accurate.
 You're just trying to get a rise out of me, sir.
 And you do not wanna make a harvard man angry.
 Lemon.
 Hey, jack.
What's up? That woman you met this morning in my office is not a colleague of mine.
 We are lovers.
 That word bums me out unless it's between the words meat and pizza.
 Her name is C.
C.
, Which stands for celeste cunningham.
 Wait! Isn't she that congresswoman that's-- trying to destroy this company for allegedly turning some children orange.
 Yes.
 And therein lies the dilemma.
 This corporation has a vy strict bros before hos policy.
 So you must really have some serious feelings for her.
 Okay, if I can't say lovers, you can't say feelings.
 But, yes, it is serious.
 And, in spite of everything, I want her to meet some of my friends.
 So I'm going to hold a dinner party, and I would like you to come.
 Oh, that's very nice.
 Thank you, jack.
 I just want you to be discreet.
 And try not to dress like a small-town lesbian.
 Well, lemon, that was a good chat.
 Good luck with that, uh, alopecia problem of yours.
 Aw, come on! I don't have that.
 Very hairy.
 hey, you guys, sorry I'm late.
 I'll take one of those.
 Sorry.
 Hey, guys, good news.
 We won an award.
 We did? Well, I did.
 Do you remember when I filmed that movie version of the mystic pizza musical? Do I! I don'T.
 Well, the ny city critics association just sent me this-- "best actress in a movie based on a musical based on a movie.
" Hey, that's great! okay, enough! How long are we gonna talk about this stupid award? We have more important things to worry about, like where are the french fries i did not ask for? You guys need to anticipate me! Okay, forget it.
 I can't rehearse today.
 it's gonna be one of those weeks.
 Oh, no, I talked to him last time when he wanted to change his name to wise greasy bastard.
 Fine.
 Oh, monsters, why did I create you? Okay, tracy.
 What's wrong? It's not fair, liz lemon.
 Everybody wins awards but me.
 Even shaquille o'neal got a kid's choice award for that animated movie we did.
 boy, I hope we rescue the starfish king on this adventure.
 It'll be a slam dunk.
 Would you call what we did last night sex? I spent two days making that movie for my homey.
 What did I get? A million dollars, a yellow bentley, and nothing.
 I never win anything.
 Look at this coffee cup my kids got me for father's day.
 I'm a failure, liz lemon.
 Maybe I should just give up and try this crystal meth i've been hearing so much about.
 No, no, no! You don't have to do that.
 You won an award! Did I not tell you? Come on, lemon.
 Yes! You are getting.
.
 A.
.
 lifetime achievement award from the.
.
 pacific rim emmys.
 Pacific rim? I love the pacific rim.
 I spent nine months in japan shooting samurai I am-urari.
 I fell in love with their culture, especially sharking.
 What's sharking? It's when you run up on a lady on the streets and pull her tube top down while your friend videotapes it.
 It's considered a crime here.
 Thanks a lot, puritans.
 Right.
 So are you ready to hit some rehearsal? Hell, yeah! I do not want to disappoint my japanese public.
 Especially godzilla.
 I'm just kidding.
 I know he doesn't care what humans do.
 All right, I'll see you out there, winner.
 He's fine.
 I just need you to make him a pacific rim emmy.
 Props has an old basketball trophy we could solder some wings onto.
 I love it.
 It is unbelievable the lengths you go to to keep that guy happy.
 I know.
 I don't get that kind of treatment.
 I don't have to treat you that way, because you're the sane one-- you're my rock.
 It is amazing how grounded i've been able to stay despite my celebri-tay.
 'Sup, dude? I went to harvard.
 I lived in lowell house and was a member of the signet society.
 If you were actually a member of the signet society, you would be wearing this pin.
 You mean.
.
 this pin? Your lame thing is on his pants.
 Hey, liz lemon, when am I leaving for japan? 'Cause I have to arrange for a snake nanny.
 Oh, I didn't think you were actually gonna go to japan.
 I mean, the award ceremony is tonight, so I told them to mail it to you.
 No! I told my kids they could come see their dad get an award.
 So it has to at least be live via satellite.
 Ah, yeah, but it's a really big time difference.
 It'll be like 4:00 in the morning here.
 Perfect! Just when I get back from maiden voyage, newark's first offshore gentleman's barge.
 I'm gonna get the kids, and we coming straight here.
 okay.
 I'll.
.
 set that up.
 Really? You're gonna do that? Liz lemon know who keeps the lights on around here.
 But I couldn't do it without my background players.
 That's why I want you and josh to be there for my award.
 And then afterwards, maybe I let you hold it.
 Then you can check out my award.
 Banter! I'm sorry.
 He's an idiot.
 No, don't blame him.
 You're the one who rewards his bad behavior.
 U give him anything he wants.
 Me, I can't even get a real exterminator to get that squirrel out of my dressing room.
 no.
 No, don't move like that.
 Good evening.
 Y I take your coat? Uh, yes, thank you.
 I'm sorry I'm late.
 The other guests have already arrived and are in the dining room.
 Oh, hipyz.
 Lemon! Is this.
.
 ev? Well, we had a longer invite list, but we thought, for the sake of discretion-- we had to eliminate anybody with any influence or connectio or stature, so that pretty much left you.
 And then we added kenneth so you would have somebody to talk to.
 "What's your favorite pizza topping?" Mine's plain.
 But I like others.
 I have to say.
 You are the most beautiful woman in this room right now.
 Liz, "tell me a painful story about your teenage years.
" Okay, let's fake this candle.
 Okay.
 okay, tracy, they are ready for your acceptance speech in 3, 2, 1.
 People of pacific rim, how you feel? All right! I'd like to thank my wife, my two sons, tracy jr.
, And george foreman, this josh dude, liz lemon, uh.
.
 baldheaded pete for setting up the satellite, and of course, a very special blonde lady.
 Shelly long, you're truly an inspiration to me! I know that! And finally, I'd like to thank you, pacific rimmers, for all that you've given us.
 Karaoke, karate, and most of all.
.
 wanizame atakku! Shark attack! Okay, so you got sharked.
 That's not great.
 I'm so humiliated.
 How could tracy not thank me? What? I drag myself out of bed at 4:00 in the morning, go home, get dressed, come in here, and he doesn't even mention my name? Jenna, the whole thing is fake.
 Yeah, but he thought it was real.
 Listen, I'm sorry.
 Tonight was crazy.
 But I did hear the janitor saying that your boobs looked good.
 I don't want to hear it, liz.
 Apparently, the only way to get respect around here is to act like tracy.
 And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
 Now, please, get out of my dressing room so I can lock myself in it.
 The squirrel! It's not afraid of people! Oh, hi, C.
C.
Are you looking for jack? No, actually, I was hoping to talk to you.
 I hope you had fun last night.
 I did.
 Boy, you and jack make a hell of a celebrity team.
 This is that chick who-- venus williams.
 Remember that time you fell asleep? Captain beefheart.
 It's like we share a brain.
 I'm sorry you got stuck with kenneth.
 Okay.
 This is not a character from a television program.
 Okay, this is not a character from the bible.
 Pass.
 You can't pass, you hillbilly.
 No, I'm sorry.
 I don't normally slap people.
 Liz, I hate to put you on the spot, but you know that I can't talk to any of my friends about jack.
 We can't keep sneaking around.
 This is getting ridiculous.
 I'm-A.
.
 the plumber.
 I'm here-a to fix-a the washing machine.
 Come right in, mr.
 Spunatelli.
 If jack and i are gonna stay together, one of us has got to give something up.
 I just--I mean, is jack worth it? What would you do? I don't think you want to take advice from me on this.
 I mean, I ate a three musketeers bar for breakfast this morning, and this bra is held together with tape, but-- .
 oh, liz, please well, jack is great.
 And he's crazy about you.
 But have you ever compromised for a man before? No.
 Me either.
 Oh, god, it was my birthday yesterday.
 I'm gonna talk to jack.
 Yeah, I think you should.
 Hey, guys, it's me, frank.
 Oh, no! Escalation! Okay, that hat's not cool, jackass.
 My mom's a great lady.
 Oh, was it her greatness that made your dad leave? He didn't leave.
 He's a submarine commander running silent.
 Let's watch this instead of working.
 Take off that costume.
 Take off yours! Never.
 C.
C.
, What are you doing here? Jack, I convinced the sheinhardt wig plaintiffs to settle.
 That's fantastic news.
 What did they end up getting? nba sexual assault money.
 They deserved more.
 The point is, now you and I can go public.
 We don't have to sneak around anymore.
 Slow down, C.
C.
It's not that simple.
 Well, what do you mean? I'm still up for a big promotion.
 My colleagues still revile you.
 But maybe in a year or so, we could reassess.
 Don't you understand what I have given up for you? Those little orange children deserved their day in court.
 They got 5 million.
 Each.
 But they deserved to be heard, jack.
 And I was ready to speak for them.
 We were going to go on oprah.
 Oh, so this is not about those kids.
 It's about you getting some publicity to get a leg up on your political career.
 I'm not going to apologize for being ambitious, jack.
 Well, you shouldn'T.
 I like when a woman has ambition.
 It's like seeing a dog wearing clothes.
 I was willing to give all that up for you.
 But you're obviously not willing to do the same.
 I just need more time.
 I should never have listened to a woman who tapes her bra together.
 Lemon.
 Don't worry, jack.
 I will sneak out through the freight elevator like I always do.
 I won't embarrass you.
 Everybody looks good in a sheinhardt.
 something's going down with jenna.
 She told an nbc tour that she was gonna get them all pregnant.
 So now I have two tracys--perfect.
 Will you trade jobs with me? Okay.
 But jenna wants this done a specific way.
 She's in her dressing room.
 Godspeed, liz lemon.
 liz, we have a serious crisis.
 We're mad at each other-- what?No.
 I have legitimate problems to deal with right now.
 But the toofer/frank rivalry has finally exploded.
 No one cares.
 Move, you're blocking me.
 I'm trying to get somewhere real.
 Is jenna in there? Bitch, are you in here? Jenna, why are you noat rehearsal? My entourage says I look tired.
 I'm sasha.
 This is patrice and master alexei.
 And your name i probably something like.
.
 melissa.
 Okay.
 I get it.
Fine.
 What do I need to do to make you feel appreciated and get them out of here? Too late.
 You had your chance.
 Ooh, melissa! Pick up your face, girl.
 I'm going to get my eyeballs whitened.
 I'll be back in a couple of hours.
 If I feel like it.
 What? No! We have work to do.
 This is what you get for taking me for granted all this time.
 Deal with that.
 Oh, melissa! Your face is on the phone.
 Soccer practice is over, and you need.
.
 to pick it up! All right, that's a pretty good burn, patrice.
 Well, lemon, I hope you're happy.
 I'm not.
 Why? C.
C.
Is demanding thate go public with our relationship, which is impossible, and you put the idea in her head.
 I'm sorry, jack.
 You know, I'm just saying what everybody's thinking.
 You just don't understand what I'm going through.
 Nobody understands what I'm going through.
 I'll take the next one, carville.
 Uh, actually-- have you got a minute? How do you and mary matalin make it work? I mean, she's a brilliant patriotic republican strategist, and you--let's face it-- are a pinko nut job.
 You know, mary and I proved that true love can weather any storm.
 Even desert storm.
 But if it's the opinion of your peers that you're worried about, you ed to get out in front of the story-- "cajun style.
" Break the news on your own terms, before your enemies find out.
 Cajun style.
 Dating a democratic congresswoman? These guys will destroy me for this.
 Jack, is it really the opinion of others that you worry about, or are you learning something new about yourself, and you find that a little scary? Cajun style.
 What are we gonna do? If we give up our feud now, we'll be ridiculed.
 Remember when lutz cried during that diamond commercial? It'll be worse than that.
 Oh, but I can't keep dressing like you.
 The new yorker festival is next week.
 We're trapped in a political minefield.
 How are we gonna get out of it? you boys need to change your story.
 Like karl rove did in the last election when he made it about gay folks and swift boats.
 What's your swift boat? You didn't hear this from me, but josh is starting to do something new with his hair.
 Are you james carville? Drop me an email and let me know how it goes.
 Trying to steal candy from a vending machine? Let me show you how it's done.
 Cajun style.
 Excuse me.
 What office should I put miss maroney's new writer in? What? No! Who said this guy gets an office? No! You let jenna take off in the middle of the day? If she gets to do that, then I'm doing this week's show as my altar ego-- Profsor cosmotosis.
 Where is jenna? I'm gonna take a nap.
 Wake me up if andy dick calls.
 Is this fun for you, being difficult? Oh, it is--I should have been doing it the whole time.
 You have been, jenna.
 You have always been difficult.
 You think tracy gets special treatment? I don't think.
 I know.
 Well, I coddle the crap out of you too.
 Your online fan club-- that's me.
 I made frank set that up as a punishment after he farted in my chair.
 And when you did that morning radio show the other week? Every caller was me.
 I am loving all of your characters.
 thanks for calling, sanjay.
 I really believe in karma.
 And this award you just got.
.
 it's a cookie.
 I don't wanna do this stuff, bui have to because you're so insecure, you get jealous of babies for their soft skin.
 And how much attention they get.
 I have lost years of my life taking care of you.
 I lie awake at night wondering what fresh hell tomorrow will bring.
 I don't sleep.
 I don't eat right.
 Thanks to you and tracy jordan-- mostly you.
 Oh, liz.
 That's all I wanted to hear.
 I'll be onstage in ten.
 And I'll wait till tomorrow to talk about you firing melon ball lady.
 All right.
 Not in front of the gays.
 hey, look who bailed on their lame feud.
 Hey, what's up with josh's new haircut? yeah, dude, you got a frohawk, man.
 What do you think, you're better than us? No, I don'T.
 I got a new nickname for josh.
 Dr.
Haircut.
 It's not even my normal barber.
 My mom did it.
 Dr.
Haircut! Dr.
Haircut! Doctor.
.
 are you gonna cry? Here's your john legend cd.
 I don't know why it was so urgent you have it before noon.
 It was just an excuse.
 Have lunch with me.
 But I have a plan.
 Do you trust me? Oh, god.
 I don't know.
 I'm 43, and you have great hair.
 I can let this play out a little longer.
 Then come with me.
 Jack, this is your executive dining rm.
 Are you trying to get me killed? C.
C.
, These people are my peers, my heroes, my past and future secret santas.
 Their approval is the most important thing in the world to me-- or.
.
 so I thought.
 Gentlemen, token ladies, I have an important announcement.
 Some of you may or may not recognize the woman standing beside me.
 Her name is celeste cunningham, and she is a democratic congresswoman.
.
 From the state of vermont.
 And she is my lover.
 That's right.
 She's my liberal hippy-dippy mama.
 My groovy chick, my old lady.
 She was our chief adversary during the sheinhardt wig hearings.
 She wants to tax us all to death and make it legal for a man to marry his own dog.
 But I think what we have is special.
 And I'm proud of her.
 And I'm not going to hide it any longer.
 I'm jack donaghy, damn it.
.
 and this is my woman.
 I.
.
 gave to npr last year.
 My children go to public school.
 I'm gay.
 I'm black.
 Oh, jack, thank you so much! And I just want you to know that in 1984 i voted for ronald reagan.
 I murdered my wife.
 snow******* and****** I******* ******* Who****** I******** But**** I am real I******* So******* Take***** But******* Yes****** Dude****** Yeah**** Keep******** ********   

                




                    			Hey,I wanted to come say merry christmas before we all leave for the break.
 Oh,thank you,lemon.
 That's very thoughtful.
 Help yourself to a gift.
 It's our new handheld photo scanner/paper shredder.
 Oh,well,won't people just end up shredding their photos? No,no,it's very to use.
 If you want to pto-scan,you flip the stc.
S.
 And if you want to paper shred,you flip the switch to-- I'd like to make an announcement! I just want to say that I'm really sorry for whatever I'm going to do at the party tonight.
 And I forgive all of you in advance for leaving me passed out by the elevator in my own gravy.
 Merry ludachristmas,everyone! Are you gonna do horny santa again,frank? That was so funny last year when I sat on your lap.
 Yes,funny.
 So big plans for the holidays? Yeah,my parents are coming with my brother, and we're gonna go see jersey boys on broadway.
 And we're gonna go to that restaurant where they pretend it's mars.
 God,you must be a ball of anxiety right now.
 No,I'm really excited.
 What are you trying to say,lemon? That your family's perfect and you never fight? No,I remember them arguing a lot during the gas crisis of '79.
 But since carter left office,it's been pretty smooth sailing.
 You got that right.
 So is your mom coming up from florida? No,I invited her out of my paralyzing irish guilt, but her plane was grounded because of hurricane zapato.
 Look at that! That's where she lives.
 Jupiter,the eye of the storm- So are you alone for christmas? No,I was gonna drive up to vermont and surprise C.
C.
 Sir! Your mother is here.
 She took a bus to atlanta.
 She got jet blue to accept an amtrak ticket.
 Tell her I'm-- jingle bells,jingle bells,jingle bells surprise! It's your mother.
 Merry christmas.
 Jack isn't this the office you had before? I thought you were up for a big promotion.
 I am,mother,and there are only two nicer offices in the whole building.
 Only two? I don't like the odds.
 I think you better let that dream go.
 Hello,liz! What the hell was th? It's a message on my phone from a friend.
 Oh,jackie,please.
 Who is she? Her name is C.
C.
 Is she spanish? What if she was,? She's very smart,colleen.
 You'd like her.
 My thanks to the peanut gallery.
 Jack,this coat isn't going to take itself off.
 proudly presents sync:ßÇÈâÈâ Season02 Episode09 Ludachristmas is tonight? Well,I guess I can make it.
 I just hope i don't get drunk and sing christmas carols like I did last year.
 Well,I'm not going,because my parents and my brother mitch are in town.
 Mitch is here? Yes.
 For those of you who don't know my brother, mitch was in a skiing accident his senior year of high school, and he has what's called trauma-induced niveaphasia.
 Basically he's just stuck in the day before his accident.
 Oh,tomorrow's the big day! It's gonna be totally rad! Yeah,mitch,rad! He thinks it's 1985.
 So if you meet him,just be cool.
 It should be mentioned that sexually mitch is very much an adult.
 No,it should not be mentioned.
 Merry christmas from sheinhart-universal,everyone.
 Merry christmas.
 Thank you! Merry christmas.
 Merry jewish.
 Merry christmas.
 What is this? It's a ps-575 photo shredder.
 Well,that's not the christmas spirit.
 Christmas is about gratitude and togetherness.
 Sitting with friends and family around a crackling fire waiting for the owl meat to cook.
 Sometimes I don't think you people understand christmas at all.
 Hi,I think I'm early.
 I'm here to have christmas meats eaten off my chest at some party.
 Merry christmas,ms.
 Lemon.
 Oh,thank you,kenneth.
 Well,fancy suits.
 How was court? Not great,beth.
 Oh,you really were in court? all tray had to do was sign his community service papers.
 But he makes a stop for breakfast first.
 So it's my fault diners can serve alcohol in new york state? That's on me now? Now I have to wear this for 30 days.
 Oh,my goodness.
 If I even had a drop of alcohol in my sweat, a signal goes to ankle bracelet headquarters in denver,and I go to jail.
 And now? This time of the year? Ludachristmas? Nude year's eve? Martin luther king day? All you do is drink.
 No,tracy,you are not going to ludachristmas.
 But-- the three of you are in charge of keeping him from drinking.
 Okay.
 But who's project manager? Hmm,that bad,huh? Oh,these aren't for me.
 I'm sending them to my mother's hotel room because the room service there is too salty.
 Family stuff can be tough.
 Lemon party! Permission to land! Permission granted! There's my baby! Hey,liz,you want to go skiing up at piper's peak tomorrow? It's gonna be rad.
 Psych! You can't go! It's the senior class trip! Oh,psych! You got me,mitch! Jack,these are my parents.
 Dick lemon.
 This is my boy mitch.
 And my first wife margaret.
 First and last,hi! Jack donaghy.
 You are a very,very handsome man.
 He looks like an arrow shirt model.
 So,jack,is this beautiful genius the best employee you've ever had or what? No.
 I like this guy's honesty.
 Yeah,me too.
 Show us what you've been working on wilma shakespeare.
 Oh,I'm just so proud of you.
 Oh,you boota boota boota! Nice to meet you,sir.
 Yeah.
 Would you wrap these up and send them to the ritz-carlton,please? Oh,my goodness! Look at this! They built all of this because of your words you wrote.
 Thank you,thank you.
 Hey,liz,guess who's going skiing with me? Chris stanek,your boyfriend! Aw,what? Shut up! I don't like him! Boys are gross! Did you hear that chris stanek got divorced? When? Is he dating again? lemon,could I have a word with you for a moment? Oh,excuse me.
 Is,uh,everything okay? Yeah,why? Your family is strange.
 Oh,mitch? No,he was in a skiing accident,and he thinks it's 1985.
 No,I get it.
 I'm talking about your parents.
 What did your mother mean when she said that you were a beautiful genius? Was she taunting you? No,they're just super supportive.
 They've always been like that.
 Even I when I sued the lower white haven school district to let girls play football.
 Hut! Feminism! What? We didn't make the playoffs that year,but I think we led the league in bravery.
 My god,I've never seen such relentless blind encouragement.
 No wonder you're a sexually frightened know-it-all.
 hey,dad,take my picture,look.
 I'm the lady from flashdance.
 that's a good flashdance,honey.
 Good flashdance.
 The holidays without drinking is rough.
 Turns out football is boring.
 My wife's sister ain't as cute as I thought she was.
 And I cannot play the guitar.
 Mr.
 Jordan,I know how difficult this is.
 I was pretty addicted to coke back in my wall street days.
 But you can get through this.
 The first night is the hardest.
 But tonight is ludachristmas.
 No,tonight you and i are gonna have some real christmas fun.
 We can play party games.
 Like murder! First,everybody takes a slip of paper out of a hat.
 And one person's slip says "murderer.
" And another person's slip says "inspector.
" Then everyone puts their head down.
 Except the murderer.
 He's the inspector.
 No,that's not right.
 K,thanks for trying to help.
 But I'm gonna go home,do some thinking, and tell my wife's sister to disregard all my emails.
 That hotel was a disaster,jack.
 The tv had over 100 channels,for god sakes.
 I'm only gonna be here for three days.
 Fine,mother.
 You can stay with me.
 No,I will not let you do that.
 Are you sure? Yes,mother,I'm quite sure.
 All right,then,that's settled.
 Jack,do you have a bathroom that I can get to in a hurry? Yes,right in here,mother.
 Well,that is close,isn't it? I'll be right out.
 She should've been there.
 Knock knock! It's just the lemons.
 We've come to drop off a little good-bye present.
 Oh,thank you! Oh,my goodness! What a beautiful office.
 Oh,your mother must be so proud of you.
 wow,look at this carpet.
 I feel like we should take off our shoes.
 Should we take off our shoes? No,please sit down and make yourselves comfortable.
 Well,we don't want to bother you.
 We know you must have big plans.
 Well,I was going to drive up to vermont and visit my girlfriend C.
C.
 Oh,I love that name.
 C.
C.
 Ooh,I'll bet any girlfriend of yours is a real winner.
 Well,she is a congresswoman.
 Oh,my goodness! And she does have her own lifetime movie.
 Lifetime! Wowsers! Why don't we cut the charade and you two tell me what exactly it is you want from me.
 now,alfonso,let's find where you should put the keyboard.
 Open,open hommina,hommina,hommina open pit barbecue sauce yes,this is the sweet spot.
 Oh,and no chitchat between songs this year.
 People don't watch letterman for paul shaffer.
 Excuse me,ma'am,do you know where the bathroom is? Hi there,mitch.
 It's jenna.
 Maroney.
 We know each other.
 Are you,like,a friend of my mom's or something? I mean,I'll tell her you said hi.
 What's up? Do you like wham? 'Cause I'm kind of like the george michael of my school.
 Oh,you're mitch.
 Yeah.
 Coming to the party tonight? Oh,I wish.
 I gotta rest up for my big ski trip tomorrow.
 You know,maybe you and i could do something together next week.
 Definitely.
 My parents are away next ******** ****** that's a filthy christmas miracle.
 There you guys are.
 I'm sorry they just barged in like that.
 On,not at all.
 They were just dropping off this christmas present.
 Oh,and look at this.
 It got cheese and butter and caramel.
 All my favorites.
 How did you know? Well,we will let you go.
 We've got a lot of window shopping to do.
 Jack,why don't you come with us? Come on,you can talk to mitch about president reagan.
 Oh,in his mind reagan is still president.
 You lucky bastard.
 What? I would love to go with you.
 Good,good,good! jack? Hey,dude,I thought you left.
 Yeah,I mean,what are you guys doing? Going to ludachristmas? Yep,we heard you can't drink.
 You still coming? No,no,I can't go because of the ankle bracelet.
 But maybe I could go and just not drink.
 Hey,maybe I'll compromise.
 I'll go to the party,cut off my foot,and drink all I want.
 Luda-christmas! Luda-christmas! Luda-christmas! Luda-christmas! Luda-christmas-- grizz,dotcom,shut the doors.
 Some people need to learn about christmas.
 Hey,watch out for her,jack.
 She's a natural athlete.
 Played high school football.
 It was just one game,dad.
 Although I did kind of change everything forever.
 I'll never forget that day.
 Jack,you laced those up like a professional.
 Good for you! It's nice to have some positive reinforcement,isn't it? Well,it's only positive reinforcement when they say it to you.
 In my case,they're just stating the facts.
 I do look like the arrow shirt man,I did lace up my skates professionally, and I did do a fabulous job finishing my muffin.
 You wish you were in my family.
 Don't be ridiculous.
 So this disney cruise in march,are you in or out? hey,huddle up.
 We're gonna take a picture.
 Yeah.
 Oh,thank you.
 Say "lemon!" lemon! jack! Having fun? Under the bridge,under the bridge,woo! Jack,what the hell are you up to? Mother,I'm sorry,but the lemons invited me out,and I couldn't say no.
 They're very nice people.
 oh,nice.
 I'll show you nice.
 Let's all meet down at the soda shop while this country turns into mexico.
 Now,you see,they don't say things like that.
 They're very polite to each other.
 I suppose you think that they're more nurturing than I am.
 Mother,there are terrorist cells that are more nurturing than you are.
 Be careful.
 I'll cry.
 You give me ten minutes with the lemon family and I'll have them tearing at each other like drag queens at a wig sale.
 Mom,dad,this is jack's mom.
 We have heard such great things about you.
 Have you? You must join us for dinner.
 no,no,no! No,we can'T.
 We have plans.
 Uh,had plans.
 An evening out with the lemons.
 Who could ask for anything more? great! Thank you,reverend gary.
 That was both entertaining and educational.
 Christmas has gone off the rails around here.
 Look out there.
 That is not a christmas tree.
 It's a way to lure tourists into the basement to buy $20 salads.
 We've lost track of what's important.
 So now we're gonna go around the circle, and every one of us is gonna say what christmas means to them.
 Let's start here.
 It's so hard to choose.
 The photos of the food look so good.
 I am gonna have the fried onion tower for two for one.
 Good for you! You must be so proud of liz.
 Making it on her own so far away from home.
 That gives us an excuse to visit new york.
 I see.
 Any grandchildren? Oh,what a shame.
 Must eat you up inside.
 Oh,well,champy,our spaniel,keeps us pretty busy.
 See,mother,not all species eat their young.
 Let's change the subject.
 Politics.
 We don't discuss that stuff.
 Life is too short.
 really? Life is too short? Because your life seems endless.
 thank you,reverend gary.
 It was to the tune of american pie,but so much longer.
 Listen,we done learned our lesson about the big tree or whatever.
 This has got to stop now! Yeah,who care abobout the true meaning of christmas? It's about getting crap and eating too much! Yeah! It's about getting drunk and hugging your cousin until your mom says,"frank,enough.
" That's right.
 Well,now seems like a good time for reverend gary to show the video of his mission to guatemala last year.
 What? Is this a culture where toplessness is common? Pieces of wood! Just like I prayed for! And here is what you did with your christmas presents.
 We take so much for granted.
 Instead of having a party,we should donate the money to those kids.
 We should tell all our family and friends we don't want any presents this year.
 yeah! We should volunteer at a soup kitchen instead of shopping for stuff no one needs! Yeah! We should go downstairs and chop down the big tree! yeah! No! No,wait! No,no,no,no,no,no,no! your mother is killing me.
 Have I ever kissed a woman? What is that about? Welcome to my world,lemon.
 She's trying to break your spirit.
 Why? Because she's trying to prove that your family is as screwed up as mine is.
 Well,that's ridiculous.
 Oh,mitch found a newspaper.
 Mitch,that's a joke newspaper! What? Why can't you just leave well enough alone? Because the lemons are not what they appear to be.
 I mean,I may be heavy furniture,but I did a pretty good job raising you.
 I mean,look at you today and look at them.
 They look happy.
 They're in denial.
 I mean,come on! Now,dick,let me get-- ah-ah,jack! It's on me.
 Wouldn't be a lemon party without old dick.
 Easy on the fried food,honey.
 Oh,come on,I can eat whatever I want.
 I'm a teenager.
 Mitch,don't you ever get tired of liz getting all the attention her being the baby and all? Oh,no,my folks make a lot of time for me.
 I mean,just yesterday we went to see goonies together-- You weren't supposed to know that,liz,sorry.
 Wait,you saw goonies yesterday? Does he mean 1985 yesterday? Yeah,december 6,1985.
 I mean,what else would I mean by yesterday? Well,that was the day of my football game.
 Did you not go to my football game? We were a little embarrassed,liz.
 Dad,did you-- it's white haven football,for god's sake,elizabeth.
 It means something.
 I wore that uniform.
 I was taking a stand for women.
 Are you taking a stand now by not giving us grandkids? Oh,you want grandchildren,margaret? Why don't you ever bother mitch about that? Because he's 17! He's 40! What? Oh,my god,the accident.
 I hit the tree.
 no,don't remember.
 Oh,I'm so old! Thank you,elizabeth lemon.
 You are so self-centered,young lady.
 You didn't even offer to pay for this dinner.
 I'm on a fixed income.
 Could I have another drink? Bingo.
 This is not what I meant! Yes,it is.
 We're sending a message to all of those who have forgotten the scruples of christmas.
 'Cause in order to stay sane,you have to go crazy! I had a couple of drinks before the meeting.
 Hold that,kenneth.
 This is a flask.
 So y'all probably shouldn't be listening to me.
 * have yourself a merry little christmas * * Make the yuletide gay * * from now on our troubles will be miles away * * here we are as in olden days* do you know why i stay with you,dick? Yes,I do know.
 Because you have no income of your own,that's why.
 I could've been drinking these for years! Explain to me again how gay marriage is gonna tear this country apart! Merry christmas,mother.
 Merry christmas,jackie.
 tomorrow night I'm gonna take you to a cathouse.
 I hate cats.
 you'll learn to love them.
 it was ridiculous to lie to him that long anyway! my life is ruined!

 It's by women for women.
 No, I'm looking at real estate.
 Jack got it into my head that I should buy something.
 You don't own any property? No.
 Do you? I own my place here.
 My condo in clearwater.
 And I bought some land in the ninth ward after katrina.
 I'm leasing it back to the government as a prison.
 Ka-ching! I gotta get my act together.
 Even frank owns that chicken ranch in nevada.
 He thought he was buying a whorehouse.
 Look, if you're serious, I do have a lead.
 My business manager says he needs cash fast, so he's selling his apartment.
 It's gorgeous.
 Okay, I'll check it out.
 Oh, you're gonna love it.
 Oh, if you're interested, A.
J.
'S also selling a speedboat and a truck full of cigarettes.
 the machine is mankind's madness and disfigurement.
 Industry castrates art.
 The only honesty is in suicide.
 I can't watch any more of these german sitcoms! Try a game show.
 Hello.
 I got your message.
 I really can't come up tonight.
 I got a mountain of work to do.
 Look, the president is only going to veto your crazy social programs.
 The founding fathers never intended for the poor to live into their 40s.
 Jack I know it's my turn, but I'm swamped with this deutschetelewelt stuff.
 If this is gonna work, we gotta meet each other halfway.
 Are you ready to play? Interrogation bear! Now-To Buy Your First Apartment Lemon, you speak german, right? I do.
 I spent my junior year abroad in frankfurt.
 I partied so hard over there, it was cr-azy.
 So many different types of sparrows! Well, I have to, um delegate some important work to you.
 As part of the due diligence for the dtw deal, I need you to watch th television shows and tell me what you think.
 Thank you.
 C.
C.
And I are trying to meet halfway, which means balancing work and love and life.
 I honestly don't know how kelly ripa does it.
 Look at us--you and C.
C.
Are meeting halfway.
 I'm going to see an apartment later.
 And the community center is going to stage my play.
 I have thing that night.
 I have a thing that night.
 Mr.
Jordan, I cannot work with that machine at my desk.
 But you can have coffee anytime you want.
 I don't drink coffee, sir.
 I don't drink hot liquids of any kind.
 That's the devil's temperature.
 Ken, this is new york, the big easy.
 Live a little! Boundaries are made to be tested.
 That's why my wife and i stopped using a "safe word.
" But I don't wanna do anything I'll regret.
 Regrets are for horseshoes and handbags.
 Oh, my! How was the apartment? It was incredible.
 river views.
 New kitchens.
 Party perfect.
 The windmere.
 An oasis from the vile obscenity ondition.
 I made an offer, and they accepted! What? I know, it's crazy.
 I guess i have to get a loan.
 Call A.
J.
But ask for "mike.
" I can't believe you bought an apartment.
 Well, not yet.
 I still have to get approved by the co-op board.
 I'm all nervous.
 I have to dress up and smile and try to get them to like me.
 It's gonna be like going on a blind date.
 Oh, no, it's so much better.
 'Cause an apartment never waits till you get in the shower then steals the necklace your mother gave you.
 the windmere: If you lived here, you'd be home now! Hey, slow down there, ken.
 Coffee is not like alcohol.
 It's pretty addictive.
 I love how it makes me feel.
 It's like my heart is trying to hug my brain.
 You know what we've never done, grizz? Fight each other! Easy, ken.
 You guys are my best friends.
 Jack, what the hell is this? Why are we meeting here? You said you wanted me to meet you halfway, and this betting parlor in the pennsylvania coal mining country is exactly half the distance between my office and yours.
 It's our special place.
 Well, technically, that corner is exactly halfway, but I'm not going over there.
 All my life, work came first.
 I missed so many weddings, funerals, karate demonstrations.
 Birthdays, lilith fairs.
 But not anymore.
 You're my new night job.
 And I'm gonna love you like my boss is watching.
 Say, what do you think they do for fun around here? Smack around nosy out-of-towners.
 Also, we have a lovely doll museum.
 Gladys knight to the stage, please, gladys knight-- hey, kenneth, I need to watch these dvds, but I haveery important meeting.
 That's great! Now, I've heard you speaking german to some of your tours.
 Oh, yes, sir.
 If you're not reading the bible in german, you're not getting the real versteckte bedeutung of it.
 Okay, well, this is very important.
 You are.
 I need you to watch these shows watchy, watchy.
 And write a summary of each one.
 It's for mr.
 Donaghy, and it has to be done by tomorrow.
 And I am delegating it to you.
 Your last name is weird.
 Are you okay? Who wants coffee? let's do it.
 Let's move here.
 We'll get a little cabin in the woods.
 I'll plant heirloom tomatoes.
 We'll ride our bikes into town.
 I'll grow a beard.
 People from my old life will pass through town.
 They won't even recognize me.
 They'll just say, "thanks, pap, " and then they'll buy some of my cider.
 The real world calling.
 Oh, my god! I'm in looooove! God, I wish this town weren't halfway between d.
C.
And new york.
 And I don't know why i lied to you guys about having read that book.
 I'm just nervous.
 Anyway, I didn't read the lovely bones.
 This is empty.
 So we have so much in common.
 we're all white.
 Funny story.
 I was on a plane once with brett favre's cousin-- it says herethat you still have an outstanding student loan? Yes.
 It is outstanding.
 No.
 I can explain that.
 The theater program at my school lost its accreditation, so I thought I didn't have to pay for it anymore.
 Look, I didn't think i was ready for this, but I am.
 There's this connection that I feel to the apartment.
 And I am a great neighbor.
 Just ask anyone in my building.
 Except raheem.
 I turned him in to homeland security.
 By accident.
 I love your building.
 There.
 I said it.
 Love.
 There's, uh something coming out of your nose.
 You missed gladys knight's sound check.
 Did you know they replace the ps every five years, just like menudo? Oh, hey, how did the meeting with the co-op board go? Good.
 Bad.
 Really bad.
 But good.
 They said they were gonna let me know.
 Should I call them? No.
 You have to wait fothem to call you.
 Yes.
 I'm going to play it cool.
 That's what homeowners do.
 Act like adults.
 Playing it cool.
 The germans are here! I am going through something right now! They're a day early.
 Jack went to see C.
C.
, And he hasn't come back yet, and he's not answering his phone.
 What? He's not? This deal has to go through.
 Then jack will be ceo, and I will be king of the assistants! Please put on some decent clothes and go talk to them.
 You're the only one who's seen all their shows.
 Where's kenneth? Gentlemen Mr.
Donaghy is not in the positions to worry himself this occurrence But your bussiness makings are much importance to his heart Return Germany Tell the Time Hubcap(?) I think they're gonna walk.
 Super.
 What happened? I just bought a german television studio.
 That's what I call a country breakfast.
 Although I've never been to a place before where they kill the pig in front of you.
 It's so quaint.
 It's strange we didn't get any ham.
 Morning shift change at the mine.
 Oh, boy.
 We'd better get back to work too.
 Oh, yeah, right.
 God, I haven't thought about work once this whole time.
 I know.
 It's weird.
 Good weird or last night weird? Good weird.
 I'll see you tomorrow.
 love a urine mirage in a desert of fear.
 What's happening? Where are they taking her? I'm getting rid of the machine, ken, for your own good.
 No.
 No, please, don't do that.
Come on! I'll make you feel good.
 Get a grip! Look at yourself! What's happened to me? You rode the brown serpent.
 But the important thing is you survived, ken.
 No.
 I made two promises to my mother before i left for new york.
 One, if I found any mackenzies living up here, I would kill them.
 And two, I would not let this city change me.
 So you had a little bender.
 It's not just the coffee.
 I also went to a pg-13 movie.
 I-I bought a pair of sunglasses.
 I tried a jewish doughnut.
 I'd always been told that new york wasthe 21st centu.
 And look what's happened.
 I've become one of them.
 I've been sodomized.
 Hey, it's liz lemon.
 This message is for the co-op board, I guess.
 This is the number you gave me.
 I hope it's not fake.
 'Cause you accepted my bid, and I haven't heard from you.
 But I'm doing great.
 I bought a german television studio today.
 Does everyone know that you're a bunch of liars, or should I tell them myself? Because I know a lot of people.
 You know what? I'm fine.
 Because I know who I am.
 You--I feel sorry for you, co-op board.
 I am going to the hospital, and I hope you're happy! I'm just confused.
 It seems weird to me that you would still be advertising the apartment after you accepted my offer.
 And I am here to remind you And you know what? I've moved on.
 I bought a whole bunch of apartments.
 I bought a black apartment.
 So Yes, sir, but I think if you-- Lemon, how do you say "buy" and "sell" in german? Verkaufen and kaufen.
 So close.
 Other way around.
 Oh, yeah.
 I always got confused by that.
 SALE OF NBC TO GERMAN FIRM RUMORED Blurgh! Yes.
 Blurgh.
 But it's a misunderstanding.
 Perfect-- I'll just tell don geiss that I let a subordinate with an unaccredited theater tech degree do a billion-dollar handshake deal while my girlfriend and i showered together at a red roof inn.
 Hockassin is for lovers oh, boy, I'm sorry.
 No, lemon, it's my fault.
 Lied to you.
 About what? All this time i've been telling you that we can have it all-- success and happiness.
 The big office and true love.
 Wait--we can't? No.
 Because they both require everything of you.
 You have to choose.
 So which are you gonna choose? Uh, excuse me.
 Could you turn off the race announcer and put on some gladys knight? And what is the champagne situation here? Okay, thank you.
 What are you still doing in washington? I can't come to hockassin, jack.
 I'm afraid if I see you, I'll change my mind.
 Change your mind about what? When I was with you the other day, I missed the vote on a bill to legalize recreational whale torture We only have one speed, jack.
 That's what I love about us.
 The drive, the ambition.
 Our belief that sex is a competition.
 It's what we have in common.
 And it's why it's impossible to pull this off.
 No, no, no, you're wrong.
 It is possible.
 I know we can't do all of this at full speed.
 We have to choose.
 And I choose you.
 Oh, jack.
 Oh, come on.
 Get in that ridiculous electric car of yours and get up here.
 Look, we are both at a place in our lives right now where we can't really spend this time-- When I was a kid, I was raised in a pretty religious household, and I remember the one time You know, I think it goes back to my mother's mother.
 She was in a loveless marriage for 40 years Yes, sir.
 I agree.
 Well, if we look at the larger trend-- well, I'll have it for you first thing in the morning.
 Thank you.
 Children, so do you agree or not? Oh, boy, uh when you think about it, there's really no answer.
 Did you take another call while I was talking? Yes, but never forgetting that you were on the other line.
 For whatever it's worth, C.
C.
, I do love you.
 Me too.
 But we can't do this.
 Maybe in another life we'll get it right.
 Sure.
 In another life.
 Thanks, pal.
 Mr.
Jordan, I just wanted to thank you for everything that you've done for me.
 It's been an honor being your friend and learning about the non-reproductive aspects of human sexuality from you.
 But this is good-bye.

                    			******holy hot mamas! But who will be the final mommy that you'd like to-- oh,you know.
 I came here to be number one! coming up next,here on nbc.
 Are you guys gonna do any work today or-- zip it.
 Milf island is on.
 boys, no rules.
 And tonight,one winner.
 Welcome to milf island.
 This show is the worst.
 Didn't one of thos milfs die during production? She had too much champagne, and a monkey knocked her into some quicksand.
 It could happen anywhere.
 miss lemon,we might have a problem.
 I went through the paper looking for that article on speed dating that you asked about uh,buh duh jee jee je when I came across this.
 Who did this? Who did what? This is from today's page 6 gossip column.
 "Which tgs with tracy jordan staffer " called corporate honcho jack donaghy "a class 'a' moron? "Donaghy is up for the G.
E.
Chairmanship, "but one employee has misgivings, adding,'that guy can eat my poo.
'" Who said this? not me.
 Not me.
 It wasn't me.
 I wasn't even working that day.
 Liz mr.
 Donaghy would like to see you in his office immediately.
 Well,it better not be about that quote because I am not taking the bullet for this! This is bad.
 Like,lose you job bad.
 Prepare for the craziest night of television of your life.
 proudly presents sync:ßÇÈâÈâ Season02 Episode11 Well,I'm going to get yelled at.
 What's going on with you? The season finale of milf island.
 and I'm gonna watch it alone in my office.
 That's pretty grim,pete.
 Ooh,a dangler! Liz,I'm gonna get free food.
 It's soy joy.
 Who doesn't love soy joy? Somebody upstairs has changed their mind about old pete hornberger.
 I'm stuck! Lemon remember this? Deborah and shauna squaring off at erection cove.
 um,I don'T.
 I don't really watch this show.
 that deborah's amazing.
 Have you heard her story? Before she was cast on milf island, she was just a struggling actress living in L.
A.
 Wow,that's inspiring.
 She has real star quality.
 You should meet with her.
 Wait,is that why you called me up here? Sir,I have sumner redstone calling to congratulate you.
 I'll return.
 The calls have been pouring in all night.
 Milf island's huge.
 I guess I should be out celebrating, but I'm waiting for a call from don geiss.
 You think he'll call me "jackie-boy"? Then I'll be at erection cove.
 Congratulations,jack.
 You must be very proud.
 When you meet with deborah, have her do her indian cab driver impression.
 She--she really pulls it off.
 Now,why would I meet with her? Because we're developing a spin-off, and I thought you could write it.
 Oh,,thanks! I don't want anything to do with milf island.
 That show is kinda lowest common denominator.
 The critics said that same thing about shakespeare.
 Yeah,but shakespeare never had a confessional shower sponsored by dove pro-age.
 So you have seen the show.
 And why shouldn't you? It has sex,lies,puberty, betrayal,relay races.
 Milf island reflects the drama of the human experience.
 And isn't that the essence of art? I don't think eating bugs to earn tampons episode nine.
 22 million viewers.
 Is art.
 Performance is an art.
 Writing is an art.
 What we do is art.
 Someone put too many farts in this engine! It's about to explode! Okay,fine.
 Don't meet with her.
 I just saw the opportunity for you to make An obscene amount of money.
 Well,no thanks.
 I have integrity.
 It's farting! It's farting! Myirt.
 Anyway,unless there's something else, I'm just gonna actually,we do need to resolve the page six debacle.
 You know,if you google the phrase "class 'a' moron," my name pops up first now.
 So step aside, randy quaid.
 Jack,I'm sorry you saw that.
 It's not good timing for me,professionally.
 I will find out who did it.
 I'll beat it out of them.
 No,no,here's how we're gonna play this situation.
 We're gonna turn up the heat on your people and see who breaks first.
 Jonathan could you round up those idiots-- hey,buddies.
 he knows,doesn't he? Yeah,and he's not happy.
 Does he think it's me? Did he--did he mention me? No,I think you're safe because I think he forgot that you're a person.
 Yeah! Come on,how long is this gonna take? Our pizzas are downstairs, and the tribunal was just about to make one of the last four milfs hang up her bikini top.
 Zalutha you've kept it tight.
 Heidi we no longer want to hit that.
 Get off milf island! Can I just get the pizzas and bring them up here? No,no,you have to stay here in case mr.
 Donaghy calls you in.
 Look,whoever did this needs to fess up now.
 I can protect you.
 I just need to know who it is.
 Fine,everybody but me close your eyes.
 Whoever did it, raise your hand.
 Oh,really mature,guys! You are on your own.
 Miss lemon,can I have a word with you,please? Lutz,come here.
 We should form an alliance.
 A what? An alliance.
 We're the two biggest dirtbags around here.
 They're gonna try to blame us.
 I don't think people see me that way.
 Yeah,they do.
 You and me.
 A couple of fat pervert losers.
 My sister-in-law did kinda a makeover on me.
 I thought-- no.
 No.
 Hello? A little help! My shirt is caught on what feels like a very sharp mechanism.
 Ooh,maybe if I can get the shirt off.
 What? What is it,kenneth? Well,I was thinking about this item in the newspaper, and something doesn't make sense.
 What do you mean? Well,I know toofer would never use the word "poo," so it's not him.
 And frank couldn't have done it because he was with me all day making fun of my haircut.
 And also, I saw you do it.
 The game is aboutto change! What do you mean you saw me do it? It was yesterday, downstairs.
 Liz lemon,I'm gonna miss the show this week.
 Jack is sending me to do stand-up in dubai.
 I'm gonna do jokes on airplane food.
 It's all new to them.
 No,tracy,you can't miss the show.
 Well,don't blame me, blame jack.
 He's the one I'm splitting the $3 million with.
 You and jack donaghy are the cause of my jawline acne! You work for jack donaghy? That class "a" moron? Unfortunately.
 Must be tough taking orders from a guy like that,huh? I don't take orders from him.
 He's an idiot.
 He doesn't know what he's doing.
 That guy can eat my poo.
 Do you work here too? No.
 I'm a reporter for the new york post, specializing in business gossip.
 And then you asked him if he was single, and he said,"don't worry about it," but then-- okay,fine,you got me! I did it.
 But I am not taking the fall for this one.
 I have taken too many bullets for my idiot staff in the past.
 Jonathan,did someone turn the heat up? No idea.
 Where I'm from, we don't notice the heat.
 that's interesting.
 I didn't know it was hot in assholevania.
 I deserve one free pass.
 But that's not the right thing to do.
 Yes,yes,kenneth.
 But jack and i are friends.
 It would screw things up if this came out.
 What if I really messed up his chances of getting that promotion? I would be so sad if I got caught for this.
 But you're not supposed to lie.
 You apple-faced goon! Fine,I will tell him.
 Oh,pray for me.
 Really? Is everyone watching tv? Yes! Okay,okay Okay I just need four numbers.
 Call anybody in the building.
 Any randomnumber.
 Yes! Hornberger! Hello,you've reached pete hornberger at tgs.
 Please leave a message.
 A class "a" moron.
 Yeah, how are you doing? Lemon,can I share something with you that I've never shared with anyone in my life? I would rather you didn'T.
 When I was a child, I had a terrible stutter.
 And I was so embarrassed by it that I rarely spoke in class.
 You were a stutterer? Couldn't get a word out.
 Needless to say I was the object of some ridicule.
 Because of my reticence, they assumed I was stupid, and the massachusetts public school system designated me a class "a" moron.
 Oh,no.
 the stutter got so bad i was taken out of my grade and put in the special class held in the boiler room.
 My only other classmate was named gilly.
 He'd fallen through the ice as a child and was technically dead for 57 minutes.
 They taught us to sweep sawdust so we could find work at a mill.
 I'm sure whoever said that thing in the post had no idea-- of course,I overcame the stutter in three languages.
 On to princeton,harvard, the top of the business world.
 I thought i'd blocked this out, but a thing like this brings back some old emotions.
 I'm so sorry.
 I feel like I'm back in that boiler room making little piles of sawdust while gilly plays with himself in the corner.
 I'm sorry, did you want something? I just wanted to tell you that I've narrowed it down to toofer or frank.
 Thank you.
 God,I am famished.
 those are jack's! Come on,guys.
 Whoever did it,just confess so we can get out of here.
 Why are you looking at me and lutz? I wasn'T.
 I think lutz'll tell you that I'm innocent.
 No,I won't,dude.
 What the frak? I thought we had a dirtbag alliance! I'm not a dirtbag.
 This is from amican eagle! You formed an alliance? That strongly insinuates guilt.
 Well,I think pointing fingers at people makes you seem guilty.
 Thanks,judas.
 I thought we had a deal.
 You lis! Who cares if you went to harvard? Who cares? Debra, what was the hardest part of this for you? I would have to say the physical challenges.
 I mean,you're tired, hungry, want to go home.
 And then you just reach inside yourself, and you find the strength that you didn't even know you had.
 I mean,one of my implants exploded and I didn't even ask to get off the catapult.
 now,boys,there are only two milfs left: Debra and deborah.
 But one of them is going home.
 And it will be revealed after three more breaks.
 Deborah's played the game so well.
 Even if she loses, america's gonna want more.
 Maybe it's a talk show.
 No,jack,I'm not working on it.
 Jonathan,turn up the heat a little more and send in kenneth.
 Kenneth? We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
 He won't know anything.
 Kenneth you're the eyes and ears of tgs.
 So liz and I were hoping you could help us to track down the person who's been saying these hurtful things about me in the paper.
 Well,sir,I'm sure that whoever did this regrets her or his mistake, and will do the right thing.
 I certainly hope so.
 Do you have any guesses? Kenneth,I need an answer.
 The stress of this is making me awful sleepy.
 sir, there's a call on two i think you're gonna want to take.
 Mr.
 Geiss,I-- oh,hello, vice president cheney.
 I'm gonna kill you.
 Yes,I hope deborah wins as well.
 No,they're not real, unfortunately.
 Get out of here! I can't believe you didn't tell him! You listen to me, li'l abner.
 Keep your fried baloney hole shut! I am not going down for this! I'll tell him you did it.
 Who do you think he's gonna believe? I'm important around here.
 Miss lemon,your eyes look like my uncle's after he would drink from the air-conditioner.
 I thought we were friends.
 I didn't come here to make friends.
 I came here to be number one! liz lemon! I can't believe they put what you said in the paper.
 Shh--how do you know about that? this is a cathy cartoon! Yeah,that cartoon copied exactly what you said the other Y.
 Chocolate,chocolate, chocolate! Aack! If you decide to sue them, I know a good lawyer! Took me to the cleers last year.
 the truth will come out.
 Like my cousin steven after he went to music college, it will come out.
 stay tuned for one final, shocking twist.
 Shut up! Brought to you buy soy joy.
 Fortified with optimism.
 Jack,it's almost 11:00.
 Why don't you let thos guys go home, and we'll all sleep on it? They called me stammerhead shark,lemon.
 What? The kids at school.
 They called me names.
 Mrs.
 Stutterworth, stutterfingers stuttermilk pancakes.
 The butter thing opened up a lot of doors for them.
 You know,I wore corrective shoes as a kid.
 Really? When I was born, I had a malformed extra baby foot extending from my actual foot.
 They think maybe i ate my twin.
 But after the surgery to remove it, I walked pigeon-toed.
 So all through grade school, I had to wear corrective foot gear that attached to a headgear.
 Gilly chewed through his headgear.
 My point is,I survived.
 It made me a better person.
 And he same is true of you.
 All this,all your success is because of that certificate.
 It made you who you are.
 And that is not a bad thing.
 Thank you,lemon.
 Look.
 The final council is starting.
 Deborah has the bearing of a queen.
 Maybe you did it! Why would I do it? That is so stupid.
 You know people at page six! I hate all of you! Order! Order,I say! We must not be rash.
 We must divorce ourselves from our prejudices, and appeal to our higher reasoning.
 This is the speaking banana.
 Everyone will get a chance to speak,and only then will we make our decision.
 Josh,my friend, you are first.
 Look,I would never do this because I'm loyal to the show.
 That dude did it! I knew it was you! Look at his light eyes.
 They're freaky like a wolf! Keep it down! Why are you still here? I love it up here.
 It's hot,it's loud, there's no pizza.
 It's like miami.
 Maybe liz did it.
 Are you kidding me? After all the times i have defended you guys and covered up for you, How dare you accuse me! you say you're sorry right now.
 I'm sorry.
 Please don't cry, it's making me feel weird.
 I can't take this anymore.
 I'm going to put an end to it.
 I said those bad things about you in the newspaper,sir.
 Kenneth,you? I couldn't lie anymore,sir.
 Because everyone knows the weight of a lie makes your soul so heavy that you can't rise up to heaven.
 And you don't look good in jeans from behind.
 But why,kenneth? Is it because I made you work late last night? Yes,sir.
 That was it.
 I was here folding milf island tee shirts until 2:00 in the morning.
 And then you didn't even offer me one.
 Needless to say i grumbled about you to anyone who would listen.
 Don't know what to say, kenneth.
 You've embarrassed yourself and the show.
 You may have compromised my chances of running this company.
 And needless to say, you've hurt me personally.
 Lemon,do you have anything you want to add? You disgust me.
 Well,that's over.
 deborah wins! She played the game so well.
 She manipulated,she lied.
 She got a pretty bad staph infection.
 But tonight, deborah is our winner.
 Who won? myirt! Jack,what are you doing here? Geiss called me.
 Oh,good.
 I've never heard him sound so happy.
 He called me "jackie boy.
" And deborah's testing off the charts in the most profitable demographics.
 Soccer moms,nascar dads, white-collar pervs, and the obese.
 Congratulations.
 I've really come a long way since that heart attack, havet I,lemon? Geiss' job is mine to lose.
 There's just one thing still bothering me.
 Kenneth's story doesn't add up.
 You want some pizza? Kenneth said he was folding tee shirts until 2:00 A.
M.
 But the post goes to press at midnight.
 Even if he somehow did bump into a reporter in the elevator, it would be too late.
 Well,you know, that guy's the worst.
 This should be the greatest night of my life, but I can't enjoy it.
 I mean,it's just k-k-killing me that somebody would say that about me.
 I'm sure the person who said it probably didn't mean it.
 And it was probably toofer.
 No,they meant it.
 They think I'm a moron, just like gilly and everyone else.
 Even gilly made fun of you? You know, it's funny,lemon.
 I g-guess I'll always b-b-b-be that k-k-k-k-k-k- k-k-k-k-k- it was me! I did it! I--I didn't mean any of it.
 I'm sorry I said you could eat my poo.
 it was me.
 I did it.
 I know.
 I just wanted to get you to admit it.
 And you do know how you're gonna make this up to me,don't you? Oh,god.
 I've gotta write the deborah show.
 She wants to sing in every episode.
 You knew.
 How? No onion rings? Ugh,this place can eat my poo! You say that word a lot more than you realize.
 Now,I need you to initial here, and sign here and here.
 I've got to admit i never thought I'd get you.
 I mean,the stutter, the certificate,gilly.
 Yeah,well,I made up all that stuff about the extra baby foot too.
 I made that up--that was to make you feel better.
 I'll walk you out.
 Heel,toe,lemon.
 Heel,toe.

 Coming up next we've got dog swap!   

                




                    			Good morning,jack.
 Lemon,I'm helping to organize a little fundraising dinner for john mccain this weekend, and I need some women to attend.
 So it doesn't turn into another giant sausage fest.
 Well,I don't know.
 What's the committee to reinvade vietnam? Just say you'll come.
 Jonathan's going to round up all the cool republican celebrities.
 Like who,chuck norris? No,C.
Nor and I had a falling-out after I switched to another dojo.
 Ah,well,sorry, but I'm not giving anybody money until there's campaign finance reform.
 ************* Oh,and I want you to book the subway hero onto the show.
 Who? The subway hero.
 Do you not watch the news? Food network doesn't have a news show.
 This guy stepped in front of a train to save a total stranger had fallen on the tracks.
 He pulled him between the rails, and the train missed their heads by inches.
 Wow,that's amazing.
 I know.
 Every show wants a guest appearance by the subway hero, but we have an advantage.
 We do? For his exceptional courage the city of new york bestows the bronze medallion on dennis duffy.
 Thank you,mayor bloomberger.
 I accept this honor on behalf of every-- stern rules!Baba booey! No,no, no,no,no.
 Oh,yes.
 Dennis duffy,beeper salesman and your ex-boyfriend.
 And dateline predator.
 Exonerated dateline predator.
 The whole thing was one big silly misunderstanding.
 Like the giuliani campaign.
 No way,forget about it.
 Lemon,be professional.
 We all have to work with people we hate sometimes.
 Jonathan,why don't you put on more of that cologne? when I say subway,you say hero.
 Subway.
 Hero? proudly presents sync:ßÇÈâÈâ Season02 Episode12 I now declare this store open for all mankind.
 Hey,dummy.
 Denn i knew you'd be ck.
 Yeah,I'm not back.
 Jack sent me because he wants you on tgs.
 No way, this is fate.
 You swe to me that you would never see me again, but this whole,crazy,on-again, off-again, dennis-liz thin it just can't be stopped.
 No,we don't have a crazy thing.
 Yeah,we do.
 We're like ross and rachel, but just not gay.
 Can I borrow those giant scissors? We always knew this would happen,didn't we? I mean, that I would be somebody.
 I can't believe it's happening because of this, and not because of my band.
 * I just want to rock * well,you have had some fame before.
 You were on dateline.
 I knew you were gonna say that.
 And it's so unfair.
 I knew that girl was 18.
 She told me that her last boyfriend was asian.
 And that crap doesn't start until college.
 So you want to do the show or not? I don't know.
 You know.
 Getting lots of offers from news and dancing programs.
 But how could I say no to you,right? I mean, maybe we should just see where this crazy dennis-liz roller coaster ride takes us, huh? Jonathan.
 Who is this? Oh,it's bucky bright, sir.
 He was a major tv star in the '40s,'50s and the fall of 1972, and he's your republican celebrity for the mccain dinner.
 Uh-huh,good to see you.
 What happened to bruce willis? He insists on singing.
 Jim belushi? He insists on singing.
 good god.
 When did the party become so boring? The democrats have all the good celebrities.
 mr.
 Donaghy, this was delivered to-- son of a married couple, bucky bright! you know who this is? Who doesn't? Most people.
 But let me ask you a question, kenneth.
 If mr.
 Bright here told you to vote republican, would you do it? Oh,no,sir,I don't vote republican or democrat.
 Choosing is a sin,so I always just write in the lord's name.
 That's republican-- we count those.
 Well,I don't know whether you know it or not, but I used to do the old soft shoe at all the eisenhower rallies.
 One,two I'm sorry to have wasted your time, mr.
 Bright.
 Kenneth here will show you out.
 Thank you.
 Boy,30 rock.
 The stories I could tell about this place.
 Eh,nobody wants to listen to me anymore.
 Oh,mr.
 Bright, I would love to hear about the good old days.
 Oh,different back then, I'll tell you.
 Yes,sir,boy, they were classy.
 Yeah,ah we didn't have any of those shirts with words on 'em, or dungarees,or anything like that,o sirree.
 Men came to work, ties and hats.
 So elegant.
 Well,and you had tailor-made suits and a little place here for a little carnation in your lapel.
 And an inside monogrammed pocket,you know, for your opium pipe and your switchblade.
 I'm sorry-- what now? Say,why don't you show me around the old studio? Okay,okay.
 These things are so bad for me.
 should not be eating these.
 Ladies and gentlemen,I give you the bravest new yorker since bernie goetz, mr.
 Dennis duffy.
 What's with the trophy? It's the stanley cup,honey.
 It's hockey's ultimate prize.
 And me and it,we're teaming up to fight illiteracy.
 Wow,I never would have had the guts to do what that dude did.
 You don't know that.
 I do know.
 I've watched seven different people die in subway stations.
 so,dennis,tell us what it was like in the moment.
 What was going through your mind? You know, it was all instinct,jack.
 My mind, it was-- it was so clear.
 All I could think about was derek jeter.
 And it was like check this out,jeter, you think you're better than me? So you brought dennis back.
 Only 'cause jack made me.
 It's just that you said never again, but here he is.
 You said, "I don't know what I see in that guy," but I was there when you two met.
 You do have this weird connection.
 Uh,why is this movie called the hours, when it feels so much longer? They should call this thing the weeks.
 The weeks.
 Liz,listen to me.
 Dennis is like those off-brand mexican cheetos.
 My sabor de soledad? I only have spanish delis in my neighborhood.
 You know those are bad for you, but you keep stuffing them in your mouth because it's easier to do that than to bother to eat well.
 That's a weak metaphor.
 You deserve a good meal, liz.
 Subway hero! subway hero! Subway hero! Tracy.
 My friend.
 Have you ever considered becoming the celebrity face of the republican party? What? Hell,no.
 Black people supporting republicans? Does hot support cold? Does rain support the earth? Now that misperception is precisely why the gop needs better celebrities, and a black celebrity such as yourself would really make us look good.
 Do you like lower taxes? If I paid taxes, I sure would.
 How about gun ownership? Go on.
 States' rights? I love states' rights.
 And let none of us forget the gop is the party of lincoln.
 Lincoln was a republican? actually, today's republican party would be unrecognizable to lincoln.
 He fought a war to preserve federal authority over the states.
 That's not exactly small government.
 Dotcom, this need you have to be the smartest guy in the room is off-putting.
 I guess that's why i'm still single.
 Damn.
 The republican party sounds pretty attuned to my unique way of life.
 But I'd be turning my back on my people to support it.
 You put me in a quandary, jack donaghy.
 A quandary.
 Back then, we didn't have pages,you know.
 We had what we called "sandwich girls.
" Oh,'cause they got you sandwiches? No,no,no, two guys'd get-- hey,my old dressing room.
 You know,that reminds me.
 for five bucks I will.
 Hey,dummy, I was just telling these dummies how we used to go in the park and make fun of all the joggers.
 Oh,yeah,"oh,I'm gonna run in a circle,so I can live longer.
" Hold on a second.
 Who orders a salad from a burger joint? You watching your figure there, sweetheart? What,are you gearing up for swimsuit season? Very funny.
 Very funny? How would you know? We used to call this "the jew room.
" oh,here,here's some lettuce from my burger.
 Hey,chief, the,uh,the kid's birthday party that hired the urkel impersonator is down around the hall.
 Are you gonna cry? Yeah,he's gonna cry.
 give her some lettuce.
 Elizabeth conworthy lemon.
 Okay,that's not my middle name.
 Explain this.
 "subway hero dennis duffy and actress sally field.
" Entertaining a guest of the show is called being professional.
 It wasn't a date or whatever-- I paid for dinner.
 You always paid for dennis.
 He can't get credit cards, jenna, because his cousin teddy used dennis' social to get a cell phone that teddy then couldn't pay for because this indian guy that he was working for you know what,I don't have to explain myself to you.
 oh,sir.
 You're back.
 Well,I never left, actually.
 I just wandered around the building all night.
 I didn't run into another single living soul, except one gigantic lesbian.
 Who is conan o'brien, and why is she so sad? What is this place? It's purgatory,tracy.
 Richard nixon? I can't believe i'm dead.
 There was still so much left on my bucket lis so many different kind of buckets I wanted to own.
 Buckets.
 It's never too late, tracy.
 You can't die now, your party needs you.
 We've lost some prestige because of the bush administration.
 And watergate.
 I'm trying to keep that on the dl around here.
 Look,I know you're worried about this, but there's a long history of black entertainers supporting the gop.
 Just ask my old friend, sammy davis jr.
 Oh,sam.
 Sammy.
 ******* You were a republican? he sure was.
 Black,jewish,one eye, a white wife.
 It was a big tent back then,tracy.
 Help us to make it a big tent once again.
 I got a mission.
 Dennis.
 Yeah,jack.
 What are your politics? Social conservative, fiscal liberal.
 You see the gop is trying to raise its celebrity profile.
 And we would love it, if the subway hero could help us out.
 Ah,no can do,pally.
 I can't help mccain.
 He's a navy man.
 I almost joined the marines once.
 All right,fine, I admit it.
 Dinner with dennis last night was fun.
 Oh,god,liz.
 What,I don't like a lot of people,jenna, but that dumb creep makes me laugh.
 But you know better.
 Do I? I might be an idiot.
 I know I'm supposed to make myself nice meals, instead of eating junk.
 Do you know what I use my oven for? Warming your jeans in the morning? That'sight, and it feels good.
 You know what that subway thing taught me,jack? It taught me to follow my instincts more.
 That's how you get ahead.
 You must know what I'm talking about--you smell rich.
 Thank you.
 My cologne is distilled from the bilge water of rupert murdoch's yacht.
 My point is,jack, you've got to be a man of action in this world, you know-- you can't overthink stuff.
 I agree.
 Not thinking is what makes america great.
 That wardrobe is wack.
 I want a leather jacket with a glow-in-the-dark skeleton t-shirt and a porkpie hat for my head,all right.
 Pronto.
 This photo shoot's gotta be phenomenal.
 You seem like a man who knows exactly what he wants.
 Yeah,I do.
 lemon? Good luck with that, dennis.
 No luck needed, jack.
 She bought me dinner last night.
 Really? Yeah,I'm in.
 And when I grab on, I do not let go.
 Like a killer whale going nuts on his trainer at sea world.
 Everything in my life is work.
 But not dennis duffy.
 I don't have to shave, I don't have to bathe, I don't have to be clever or nice,you know.
 I can just be myself.
 Isn't that what love really is? No.
 Love is hiding who you really are at all times, even when you're sleeping.
 Love is wearing makeup to bed and going downstairs to the burger king to poop, and hiding alcohol in perfume bottles.
 That's love.
 Uh,it just sounds hard.
 Being with dennis is easy.
 If you give into it,you just start to feel kind of numb and warm, and then you just get sleepy.
That's not that bad.
 That's exactly what they say it's like when you freeze to death.
 Blurgh.
 Oh,whoa,whoa, look at,there I am.
 Oh,is that really you? Yeah,me and the boys.
 Yeah.
 Boy.
 Men were men back then, I'll tell you.
 You wanted to do something private with another man, it wasn't gay.
 No,it was just two men celebrating each other's strength.
 I'm in.
 Jacky D.
 Nixon's ghost convinced my ghost to help the gop.
 God bless that wiretapping bastard,this is great.
 We've got to shoot a couple commercials right away.
 The mccain dinner is saturday.
 Sounds good, but I can't talk now.
 I gotta get my wallet out of the toaster.
 Okay.
 Yeah,you like that? Maybe a couple photos where you don't give the thumbs-up.
 Nah,it's my thing,dummy.
 You know what? Doesn't matter.
 Just getting through the week.
 You know,it's all really happening for me.
 My people, my city, my woman, huh? I tell you,everything is starting to go my way,liz, 'cause I'm a man of action, yeah.
 I gotta stop overthinking everything like I used to.
 That was never your problem.
 Elizabeth sarah lemon-- that's not my middle name.
 Will you marry me? Oh,god.
 wake up,dummy.
 Hey,space cadet.
 Right here-- will you marry me or what? No,no way.
 You don't know this guy.
 He is not the man you think he is.
 Hey,what is your problem,liz? I could get any girl here i want.
 And not just the fatties and the butterfaces.
 Shut up,crowd.
 I command you as the subway hero-- shut up.
 Unbelievable,liz.
 Hey,you know, I don't need this.
 You know a stripper offered to give me a squeezer last night.
 A white stripper.
 Uh,thank god i didn't fall for this.
 You are not a hero, you're a loser.
 And you will always be a loser.
 Oh,I'm the loser.
 I guess I'm the one who totally missed catching the puck at that islanders game-- you suck.
 No,you suck.
 And so do all new york-based sports teams.
 Liz,don't say anything you can't take back.
 My fellow blackmericans-- hey,jack.
 Can I just say black americans? There's no such thing as blackmericans.
 That's great, that's why you're here.
 My fellow black americans, dr.
 King once had a dream, a dream that we all share: To build a And he also hated the estate tax.
 unbelievable.
 Jack,I don't know about this.
 What's wrong? I get it.
 The republican party means less taxes,more guns, and the end of the gun tax.
 Go on.
 But everybody isn't forward-thinking like I am.
 No matter what,blackmericans are gonna always vote democrat.
 They will, won't they? Unless black people, don't vote.
 Just don't do it.
 In the amount of time it'd take for you to vote, you could play three games of pool.
 Three.
 And that's fresh.
 I'm tracy jordan, and I improve this message.
 paid by the committee to reinvade vietnam.
 Sure feels good to make a difference,doesn't it? Yes,it does.
 Now if you'll excuse me, nixon asked me to take some stuff out of his wikipedia page.
 Hey,jack,I'm sorry,this dennis thing is not gonna work.
 I can't even be in the same room as that idiot.
 Save it for your I-village blog, lemon.
 Dennis is off the show.
 I booked the 911 bird.
 Winston dialed 911 with his beak and said fire, but only because he didn't know the word for rape.
 Well,that's fine with me, but we've been promoting the subway hero.
 The subway hero's 15 minutes are up.
 Now if you could let him know that,that would be great.
 Hey,you're not bumping dennis for my benefit,are you? Well,of course I am.
 I base all my business decisions on your needs.
 That's why G.
E.
'S going to be introducing the pocket deep fryer.
 That would sell, by the way.
 Well,when we sobered up, we realized we'd eaten the peacock and we put the ham in pat weaver's office.
 Mr.
 Bright.
 With all due respect, I can't listen to this anymore.
 I love television,sir, and you are ruining it.
 I love television too.
 But I wanna tell you something.
 If you're gonna make something beautiful, you gotta make a mess of it first.
 I don't care whether you're making an omelet, a baby, or a television show, things are gonna get weird.
 Well,I'm afraid the biz has changed since your time.
 Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to chinatown to pick up some human growth hormones so that mr.
 Jordan's tigers don't realize that he's aging, and oh my there's your weird.
 A bird? Dennis, I'm very sorry.
 Oh,really? Why? It seems like all that stuff you said came true.
 I am a loser.
 My mall appearance got canceled.
 The mighty ducks are mad at me because I left the stanley cup on a water taxi.
 You know, I thought I'd done something good enough to get you back.
 I can only imagine the classic song I'm gonna write after this.
 Well,that is a very disturbing story.
 Aw,you're just saying that.
 No,no,no,no,you've seen some stuff,I'll tell ya.
 Oh,well this one's dating a dateline predator.
 Exonerated.
 And we're not dating.
 You don't know what you're talking about,kenneth.
 Boy,that's one mouthy sandwich girl,isn't it? It was on a subway platform just like this.
 On a night just like this.
 It's still daytime.
 And we're inside.
 You know what the worst thing about this whole hero thing has been? Is that I got a chance to see what my life could have really been like.
 You know,if like the beeper business had taken off, or I hadn't failed the firefighter exam.
 You failed the firefighter exam? Yeah,it's totally biased against the irish,you know.
 You know,liz, being with you and being a hero are the two greatest things that's ever happened to me.
 And I just,uh, I just wish i could get it back.
 you're gonna be fine.
 If reality tv has taught us anything, it's that you can't keep people with no shame down.
 I really believe that you are gonna do something else great in your life.
 Dennis,don't you dare.
 Liz,work with me now.
Just go limp.
 It'll be phenomenal, liz,come on.
 ******* Come on,no,no,no,no.
 No,I don't want to.
 Ah,damn,it's the wrong track.
 It's stupid express.
 You thought it was this track too,didn't you? Jackass.
 What,come on.
 It was just a goof.
 Never again.
 Never! You'll be back, liz lemon.
 You'll be back.
 you'll be back,dummy.
   

                




                    			On my stage? No way.
 Oh,hey there, little guy.
 What the hell? We have rehearsal.
 He can't tell me- no,no,no,no,no-- the most important thing is to know who you can trust and who you can't trust, and that man cannot be trusted.
 What are you worrying about? You have the job.
 It's not over till it's over.
 The game is still on and nobody plays it like banks.
 Stay clear of him, little buddy.
 Then after you carbonate it, you drink it! Sounds like soda pop.
 Damn it! Why is leaving your children a legacy that'll live forever so hard? It's been almost half an hour.
 Maybe we should take a break,mr.
 Jordan.
 Yeah,I need to clear my thoughtcicles.
 Which one of my two favorite pastimes shall I indulge in? Video games or pornography! THICK THIGHS/ARMY GAME OF DEATH That's it! Make a porn video game! Hey,liz.
 Ight? where's your buddy jack? Packing up his office? I don't know anything about jack, so you're wasting your time.
 So you don't know about him accidentally selling nbc to some germans? Uh,no.
 Really? 'Cause rumor has it that he's trying to pull a death spiral: Inflating the company's value, shorting his own stock and then making a killing.
 What--no,that's completely not true.
 Jack was nowhere near that meeting.
 He wasn't even in new york 'cause he was off with his girlfriend leaving me in charge, so take that,liz.
 Oh,god.
 That was so easy.
 Like taking candy from one of those guys who gives out candy at gay night clubs.
 Oh,my god.
 Please don't say anything.
 I'll give you kenneth.
 Well,as enticing as that is, I'm straight now.
 I think that my future father-in-law needs to hear about jack's little career killer.
 Well,then he'll also need to know about the security camera footage of you cheating on his daughter with another woman.
 What? No.
 No! No! No! Oh,god! You loved it! A porn video game? It can't be done.
 Look,tre, history's greatest perverts have tried: Walt disney,larry flynt, the japanese, but they can't do it because of the uncanny valley.
 Let me show you something.
 Check out this chart.
 You see, as artificial representations of humans become more and more realistic, they reach a point where they stop being endearing and become creepy.
 Tell it to me in star wars.
 All right,we like r2d2 and c3po.
 They're nice.
 And up here we have a real person like han solo.
 He acts like he doesn't care, but he does.
 But down here we have a cgi storm trooper or tom hanks in the polar express.
 I'm scared! Get me out of there! That's the problem.
 You're in the valley now and it's impossible to get out.
 That's where you're wrong.
 I was born to design a video game where characters get weird with each other for golden points.
 My genius will not be denied.
 I'm like mozart.
 You're like that guy that was always jealous of mozart.
 Salieri? No,thank you.
 I already ate.
 You will not deter me.
 The world is gonna remember the name tracy jordan.
 Well played,lemon.
 To get through it, I pretended he was a sandwich.
 It's good to have you in my corner.
 Hey,you know, I've always got your back.
 Lemon, where do you see yourself in five years? Realistically,teaching improv on cruise ships.
 Lemon,I'm promoting you to head of east coast television and microwave oven programming.
 What? When did you get microwaves back? You're going to be my successor.
 No--no,I'm not an executive.
 Executives are,like, huh-huh-huh.
 And I'm,like, haa.
 I mean,I'm a creative person.
 Sure,there are times when my job is frustrating, like when lutz calls in sick with march madness, but I mostly love it.
 This is the starting salary.
 Suck it,monkeys! I'm goin' corporate! Word is the board is meeting later this week.
 Guys must be close to making a decision.
 I wouldn't know anything about that.
 He guys,let's change the subject to sucking at golf, so donaghy has something to talk about.
 I'm sorry about that.
 I'm a little nervous.
 Don't apologize.
 You're a natural.
 I'm feeling pretty drunk.
 Well it's business drunk.
 It's like rich drunk.
 Either way,it's legal to drive.
 all right,gentlemen, we should do some work.
 You suck,stan! As you know, we've sunk a lot of money into developing this new microwave start button.
 It's been four years and $10 million.
 I think it's time we pull the trigger.
 What do you think? I kind of like the old button.
 Button classic.
 I love it.
 Button classic? It's hip and homey.
 Oh,my god,guys.
 We're crushing it! Your first executive decision and you've already saved this company $2 million in future r and D.
 But what if I'm wrong? There is no wrong.
 Lemon,you just have to find a subordinate you can push the blame onto.
 That's why I love jorgenson here.
 I think you're ready to meet the old man.
 Jeez,jack,offer to buy a girl dinner first.
 classic lemon! I've never seen you like this,mr.
 Jordan.
 This project is consuming you.
 No,for the first time in my life i know my purpose.
 I'm doing this for my children.
 My genius has come alive, like toys when your back is turned.
 I see the potential for erotica in everything around me.
 This cup,this table even you,kenneth.
 Well,I am wearing a cuffed trouser today.
 Tracy,what are you doing? They need you in wardrobe.
 I'm inventing a porn video game.
 Let this man work! No one is to disturb him! Don't hold your breath, pete.
 It can't be done or else i would've solved it a long time ago.
 Yeah,I would have.
 Hey,nerds!Guess who's got two thumbs, speaks limited french, and hasn't cried once today? This moi.
 Liz.
 You can't be serious about going off with donaghy.
 How can you abandon me like this? No,I'm gonna promote you outta here.
 You're gonna be an executive! I don't want to be an executive.
 This is your starting salary.
 I know.
 Uh,don.
 I'd like you to meet liz lemon.
 Aren't you the gal who pioneered the button classic campaign? That was me! Where the hell has donaghy been hiding you? Oh,my blood sugar is dropping.
 Liz,sweetie,can you run out to the dessert table and get me something? Oh,sure,but you should know that I work for tips.
 You got the charm and spark of a young leona helmsley.
 Is that-- is he finished? Not yet, but don't disturb him.
 He can't keep going like this.
 He was up for six hours straight.
 My god.
 He's a genius.
 Ugh,look at that loser, sitting all alone and sad.
 He's like me yesterday.
 I hate him.
 Oh,I don't know, lemon.
 I'm actually starting to feel sorry for the poor bastard.
 Hoo,boy,got your period? Business drunk! More business juice, please! Oh,right--geiss! So are you enjoying the party? Wha--how could I not be? Just can't wait to take this sexual energy back to kathy.
 Banks,don't do this.
 Don't marry kathy.
 It may not be worth it.
 Why not? We're absolutely perfect for each other.
 She loves that I work out a lot and talk to people.
 And I love how she enjoys crawling into cabinets and vents and other enclosed spaces.
 Like behind the dryer, for instance.
 You don't really love this woman.
 Look how miserable you are at your own bachelor party.
 That's not why I'm miserable, you idiot.
 I'd marry 1,000 kathy geisses to be ceo.
 I'm miserable because I know that I'm not getting it.
 Yeah.
 Geiss told me that it was gonna be you,jack.
 At my own sham bachelor party.
 Mr.
 Geiss,I'm sorry it took so long.
 Mr.
 Geiss? Oh,blurgh! So go ahead,donaghy.
 Rub it in my face.
 Normally I'd say, "I bet you'd like that," but today I won'T.
 Devin, I'm the only other person who understands what you were willing to do for this job and how devastated you must be that you're not going to get it.
 It's like when christian won project runway even though rami was clearly the better draper.
 Oh,god.
 I've got to call this wedding off.
 Devin, I just want you to know I hate-respect you.
 And I you.
 I think geiss is dead.
 We've got to call dr.
 Spaceman.
 Duet becomes a trio.
 A trio becomes a quartet.
 And on and on.
 Do you have it? You go too fast! I've given my whole life to porn and he does it in one day! One day! What's wrong with him,leo? Well,to the untrained eye, he'd appear to be what we in the medical community call "sleeping.
" But he is,in fact, in a diabetic coma, which could've been avoided by what we call "eating.
" Do whatever you can,leo.
 He has to wake up.
 Okay.
 This is the gross part.
 Ew,almost done.
 Almost done-- Oh,damn it.
 That shot was just a placebo.
 I was hoping this was psychological.
 He may not be faking it for attention.
 Jack,have you seen don? Oh,boy, that doesn't look good.
 Don't panic,jorgenson.
 It's under control.
 He just has to say one sentence.
 Couldn't you just,you know, inject something right into his heart? Oh,I'd love to, but we have no way of knowing where the heart is.
 See,every human is different.
 Jack.
 It's okay.
 Don isn't feeling well.
 He's in a diabetic coma.
 But possibly faking.
 How did this happen? It was jorgenson's fault! Fair enough.
 It's all right.
 I'm in charge now.
 You see,yesterday i met with don and he said I'm going to become his successor.
 So I'm the ceo.
 Jack,if this is a power grab, it's in very bad taste.
 No,no,he said it.
 He told me to keep it a secret.
 No,it's true.
 I heard it secondhand from jack.
 banks! Banks knows.
 He can back me up.
 Jack jack,I don't know what you're talking about.
 Oh,daddy! Daddy,no! Daddy! Is it 4-1-1 or 9-1-1? Uh,new york.
 Uh,diabetes repair, I guess.
 jack,I know you're mad at me.
 Lemon,I am not mad at you.
 Look,tgs is really where i belong.
 I'm not cut out to be an executive.
 Nonsense.
 Granted,you almost killed don geiss.
 But let's not forget, button classic.
 Right,button classic.
 I crushed that.
 So we both had a mixed day.
 That's business.
 Today the board is meeting and I am still their best candidate.
 And after I state my case, I'm sure they will want to fulfill don geiss's pre-coma wish.
 Oh,okay,great.
 Because I don't think i can return this 'cause I got business sick all over it when I got home.
 Get out of here,banks.
 I have nothing to say to you before this meeting.
 Then I'll do the talking for the both of us.
 Whaddaya mean,banks? I'll tell you,jack.
 There is no meeting today.
 See,I convinced the board to have an emergency meeting last night.
 I tried to call you, but not on a phone, so you may not have heard me.
 Devin,what did you do? I did what's best for the company.
 You see,I convinced them it was best to act quickly to quell any fears among investors.
 And everyone agreed that, for the sake of continuity, the geiss family's steady hand should remain on the wheel.
 Of course,kathy's gonna need some guidance, but that's what her fianc? s for.
 No,this can't happen.
 Oh,it's happening.
 Now get out of our office.

 He's installed your daughter as the ceo.
 Don't get me wrong.
 She's a wonderful girl.
 I've been stripped of all my responsibilities ******** ********* on 12.
 wake up-- please! marcus schenkenberg was there.
 who? Okay,the craziest thing happened this morning.
 I was home on my treadmill, and the phone rings, and you will not believe who it was.
 Liz? It's,uh,floyd.
 oh,my god, floyd called? You were using your treadmill? Yes.
 And,yes,pete.
 I use it every day.
 What did floyd want? He's in town.
He was only supposed to be here for a day, but there's some big storm coming, and his flight on jetfun got cancelled.
 Jetfun--is that the one with the footbaths? Oh,no,that's airbike.
 They also have in-flight pornos and nbc news.
 Jetfun's the one that hands out fresh popcorn.
 Listen to me! Floyd wants to know if he can crash at my apartment-- so?What's the big deal? I haven't seen floyd since he left for cleveland.
 The last time I tried to get in touch with him, some rust-belt tramp answered the phone.
 And now he's here,and I don't know what crash means.
 I just don't wanna embarrass myself.
 I wanna be top dog for once instead of just dog.
 Then you need to make him regret ever leaving.
 You need to pretend you're doing great.
 I am doing great.
 for once,I am not gonna be jan brady.
 I'm gonna be marcia, damn it.
 My nose! my bad! See? It's starting already! Look out,floyd.
 There is a new liz,and-- Ooh! Sandwich day.
 what's that? You've never heard of sandwich day? Why,it's the most wonderful day of all.
 Once a year, the teamsters go to this italian sandwich shop in brooklyn.
 No one knows what it's called or where it is.
 It's a teamster secret.
 But they buy us these sandwiches oh,sus******** God bless us,every one! Well,I wish you the very best with the office,kathy.
 By the way, you know who hates unicorns? Wahlberg.
 Kathy geiss's office.
 please hold.
 Mr.
 Donaghy,you're not really going down to 12, are you? I have to.
 Of course it's humiliating.
 Banks is trying to shame me into leaving.
 But where else am I gna go? I've been sleeping with the cindy awford of corporations for the last 22 years-- what am I supposed to do, st l dowwi san what about washington? I'm sure your friends in the bush administration-- Bush? Has it gotten that bad? Good god,I'd rather work for an american car y than jon that sinking ship.
 Made you this.
 ****** Well * I will remember you * * will you remember me * * Dooby-do,dooby-do don't let your life pass you by * Oh--hold it! Hey,jack.
 I got a company-wide email from the new ceo that was just a link to cats wearing bowties? Is everything okay? Everything's great.
 Yeah,I'm really crushing it.
 Why you going to 12? Business.
 I can't believe sandwich day is over! Hey,look.
 Lutz is still eating.
 you're savoring it? What,you think you're better than us? No,that's not it at all.
 Since my surgery, I have to eat slowly or my insides might explode.
 Gimme it! It's like knives! Look,z lemon's sach is still on her desk! Taking liz's foodot good.
 E'my aheese? But as far as liz lemon knows, her sandwich never came.
 U-uh,liz? Floyd,I didn't see you there.
 You look great.
 Do I? I'm pretty tired from playing as hard as I work.
 okay,now, bring up 23 and give me some air.
 My key.
 Thank you.
 Thank you so much for doing this.
 can I take you out to dinner tonight? You know,maybe we hit that barbecue place you puked at.
 You'll have to be more specific.
 Well,I'll see you back at your place.
 Somebody get me ouof thidress******** you guys are working hard,for once.
 Where's my sandwich? Lutz made us do it! No,it was frank! It was jordan! stop it! This is all my fault, miss lemon, because I let it happen.
 And the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
 please ask my permission before you quote me,kenneth.
 I don't know how but you're gonna get me another sandwich, or I'm gonna cut your face up so bad, you'll have a chin.
 You'll all have chins! floor 12.

 It's me again,sir.
 I thought you'd like to know that it's snowing out, the city all silent and white.
 Wake up! Wake up! wow,snow in may.
 Thank you,global warming, for extreme,unpredictable weather patterns.
 There was actually a tornado in cleveland last week.
 Destroyed an entire city bck.
 Three bowling alleys, a liquor store, and the liquor store museum.
 So do you have time to grab dessert? Yikes! Did you know it is 4:30? I haven't stayed up this late since college.
 And behind this trap door, more orcs.
 That'll really piss off samir.
 My flight's in two hours.
 I'm sorry,I gotta go.
 You know,sometimes I really regret leaving new york.
 Like right now, for instance.
 Well,what does new york have that cleveland doesn't have? I read that you guys are getting an ikea.
 Yeah.
 I'll believe it when I see it.
 Well,we've just been burned before.
 It was really great seeing you,liz.
 I'll see you.
 now,turn and look back at me.
 Atta boy.
 Eat it up,cleveland.
 Oh,god.
 Youths! I'm losing it,don.
 I mean,I been walking the streets in this crazy snow, trying to figure out who I am, where I fit in.
 I even stopped to catch a snowflake with my tongue, butly,that'sort of signal in C.
 Just give me a sign.
 I've given everything to this company, but now I feel that maybe I should quit.
 You have to leave.
 What? Visiting hours were over some time ago.
 What happened to your voice? I was hit by lightning as a child.
 They made a movie about me.
 You have to leave ge.
 What did you say? Geriatric extended care.
 That's what this wing of the hospital is called.
 I have to leave ge.
 after last night's freak snowfall, it's 90 and humid.

 Hello? How did it go with floyd? The poor guy got lemoned.
 Hard.
 Started babbling about how he wished he'd never left new york.
 Did you do that thing I showed you? No,jenna,I did not come back from the bathroom and hand him my underwear.
 That's how I met that mobster.
 Next time floyd brings some corn pone tranny back to his apartment, all he's gonna be thinking about is me, standing there in the snow, looking like the one who got away.
 Crone! We'll get liz lemon her sandwich.
 An inational superstar.
 The teamsters will be honored that I'm even talking to them.
 * That old soft shoe * * is comin' around the bend * that's enough.

 Oh,no,no.
 We're cancelled.
 Cancelled? You gotta be kidding me! Oh,I would have checked my flight,but-- oh,no,no.
The airline is cancelled.
 We're not an airline anymore.
 Wait,wait,wait.
 One storm? That's all it takes? We're still gonna make popcorn.
 Just no more airplanes.
 I'm sorry.
 Hey,karen.
 I hate your guts.
 I'm sorry to barge in on you like this.
 You know, my cell was dead 'cause I didn't bring my charger.
 Who was that bitch that answered your phone eight months ago? So this girl, what's her lower back tattoo? A chinese character that she thinks means peace, but it really means "I have chlamydia"? Oh,my god,liz,I'm so glad you're bringing this up.
 Really? You are? Yeah,I-I feel bad how we never got to talk about it, and I didn't bring it up last night because we were having so much fun, and I didn't want to ruin it.
 Okay,well-- okay.
 I-I've been thinking about this a lot, and it's just-- oh,shoot.
 Hold on.
 I'm sorry.
 I got a flight.
 In 40 minutes.
 No,no,no,no.
 This is more important than me getting home or my partner meeting with peter venkman.
 No,don't do that.
 Just go.
 But you call me.
 I will.
 I-I will.
 O-or you could ride to the airport with me.
 No,it's okay.
 You go,and we'll talk.
 Okay.
 And I thought you were cool last night.
 I do rock.
 A drinking contest? What am I,12 and at my boyfriend's frat party? We need you,jenna! Lutz can't drink because of his operation, kenneth doesn't drink.
 Drinking's against my beliefs.
 Like gambling or freeway driving.
 And I can't drink--I still got my hollywood sock on.
 And I can't have booze because I'm on antibiotics after having some skanky club sex.
 He's on antibiotics because he lost his lucky penny and assumed it fell in his ear again.
 Shut up,lutz.
 Your surgery was for an undescended testicle.
 Wrong again! It was for two undescended testicles! Okay,wait,so no one else is drinking against the teamsters? It's only me? I'll do it.
 But only for the attention.
 Yes! Is lemon around? I haven't seen her, sir.
 Tell her I need her.
 I'll be on 12 the rest of the day.
 That's a joke.
 Hey,can you make the teamsters tell us where they get those sandwiches? Only if you beat them in a drinking contest.
 It's in their contract.
 I'm a bitch, I'm a lover I'm a child, I'm a-- mother! Floyd? Oh,boy.
 Oh,no! Why aren't you at the airport,floyd? There was no flight, was there? Not at the time,no.
 But I do have one tonight,so you lied to me.
 I just didn't want to talk about that stuff.
 Can't we just fast-foward to being friends again? You know-- Your cell phone was dead! You faked that email! Peter venkman! That's from ghost busters! You used ghost busters for evil! I'm glad we didn't talk about that girl, because you're a liar! Okay.
 Okay,fine, you want some honesty? I don't know what girl u're talking about,liz.
 I'm single.
 I'm a lawyer.
 I wear ne coats.
 I'm the michael clayton of cleveland.
 Well,I hope your car blows up! Look,you made a choice! I asked you to come to cleveland with me, you nut job! I'll move to cleveland when you get that ikea-- never! Oh,you-- don't you deprive the good people of cleveland an ikea! You are vindictive, liz lemon! Smooth.
 Oh,come on,you guys.
 You guys do one.
 I've had ten shots.
 You've only had five shots.
 No,today.
 I've had ten shots today.
 You fought a hell of a good fight,blondie.
 But you can't win.
 We failed.
 I found my lucky penny.
 It's not in my ear.
 battery's dead.
 I got a half hour before they track me down.
 Alcohol? This smells just like hill people milk.
 I been drinking this since I was a baby! It's on,y'all.
 Yeah! Oh,boy.
 How'd they do that? * I'll be here in sunshine * * or in shadow * * oh,danny boy* so should I ask why you're showing up for work at 6:30? I'm not gonna lie to you,jack.
 I was working from home.
 Lemon,we should talk.
 Fine.
 Floyd was in town, and it was awful.
 And it started out great, and then it was awful, and now it's over.
 What happened? He lied about going to the airport.
 And? And I said I hope he dies in a car explosion.
 Lemon,life is about minimizing regrets.
 You never know when someone's going to slip into a coma and leave you regretting all the things you didn't say or get in writing from the company's lawyers.
 What I'm trying to say is you'reyoung, and you still haven't blown it completely.
 So don'T start now.
 I hate going to the airport.
 Floyd.
 Floyd! Sorry.
 I need the cheapest ticket you have going anywhere.
 What's that in your bag? Uh,a sandwich and dipping sauce.
 That's more than 3 ounces.
 You can't bring that past here.
 Really? No,look,I just need to catch up with this guy before he gets on a plane to cleveland.
 That's sort of a cliche.
 You're sort of a cliche.
 One-way ticket to montreal.
 Crazy eyes.
 I should detain you.
 Look,please,I just need to talk to him before he takes off and I never get the chance again.
 Fine.
 Just leave the sandwich and go through.
 Leave the sandwich? Leave the sandwich.
 Boarding call for flight 254 to cleveland.
 You're choosing a sandwich over a guy.
 That is less cliched.
 I can do it! I can have it all! God,lady, you're eating foil! Floyd.
 Floyd! Liz.
 What are you doing here? I don't want your car to explode, and I don't want you to go into a coma.
 And I don't want to stab you in the face with a giant fork.
 What? Oh,that's not you.
 I've been threatening a lot of people lately.
 Look,liz,I'm really sorry about what happened,you know.
 Are we at the part where we just become friends again? I-I came to the airport, didn't I? And I wolfed my teamsters sub for you.
 Wait.
 No.
 Is that a saying? Don't worry about it.
 Final boarding call for flight 254 I gotta go.
 Oh,I-I still have your key.
 You should keep it.
 I mean,if you want to.
 You never know.
 Yeah,yeah,yeah.
 Yeah,you never know.
 I'll see you around, liz lemon.
 msnbc has confirmed that former ge executive jack donaghy will be named by president bush as the new homeland security director of crisis and weather management.
 Flight 31 to montreal is now blurghing.
   

                




                    			This is it, Lemon.
 Government.
 The true seat of American power.
 This is all happening so fast.
 I mean, last week you were at ge, and this week you're-- what are you in charge of exactly? We're sharing the load.
 It's a bit of homeland security.
 they still have that? Extreme weather preparedness and the war on the poor.
 You mean the war on poverty.
 Yeah, okay, let's go with that.
 So you're never coming back.
 I'm sorry, Lemon, but there's nothing left for me at ge.
 Sure, Geiss could come out of the coma and say, "Jackie boy, you're the next ceo, " but that's not likely.
 The cryogenecists are already sharpening their head saws.
 Oh, this is all so weird.
 It's making me sick to my stomach.
 Lemon, it's 8:00 in the morning.
 Are you eating those Mexican cheese curls? Hey, dont knock my Sabor de Soledad.
 I found a prize in here the other day I hope.
 Lemon, I have to go.
 It's time for my freedom search.
 Liz Lemon, do these look like wizard nipples to you? Well, I dont know.
 Are the lightning bolts suppos *** in or out? Exactly.
 Is all wrong.
 This world is so clear in my head.
 oh, are these the characters for your porn video game? The working title is goregasm, colon, the legend of dong-slayer.
 sorry about the wizard, Tracy.
 I'll call the Korean animators.
 Yeah, you fixulate this! I'm sorry.
 Liz Lemon, do you know what it's like to be the only one who cares about your job when everybody else around is goofing off like a bunch of goof-offs? Yes.
 Emotions.
 You having your woman times? What? No! I just had my woman times last-- oh, boy.
 proudly presents sync:ßÇÈâÈâ Season02 Episode15 why dont I cross out the days like people in the movies? I think you're supposed to take all of them.
 Like, in a row.
 Thank you, cerie, but I've been sexually active since I was 25.
 Mr.
Hornberger? I was wondEring if I could ask you to write a recommendation for me to be a page at the x-x-I-x summer olympics in Beijing.
 Sure, Kenneth.
 Have you ever wanted to go to the olympics, Mr.
Hornberger? I almost went once.
 Bad news, archers.
 President carter has decided to boycott the Moscow games.
 Peanut farmer.
 Anyway, I was wondEring when you were gonna come to me for this.
 You know the applications are due today.
 Today, sir? The memo I got said they were due in two weeks.
 No, it's today at 5:00.
 I have to write my personal essay! Donny? Parcell.
 Thought you'd be coming out of that door.
 Did you get my memo about the olympic applications being due two weeks from now? Saboteur! Looks like you'll be staying here in New York all summer-- fighting the crowds, smelling the hot garbage, while I travel to beautiful, breezy Beijing.
 The day's not over yet.
 Hey, you must be Jack Donaghy.
 Cooter berger, vice chair of farm subsidies, acting head of fema, temporary acting head of the fbc while the acting head is on trial.
 Wow, you've had a lot of shake ups around here lately, huh? I couldnt disagree with you more.
 The administration has been streamlined.
 And the media are so obsessed with the current election, they've completely forgotten we're here.
 It's an exciting time.
 I'm glad to hear it.
 I dont like to think of this president as a lame duck.
 I like to think of him as a lame eagle.
 The ceiling appears to be leaking.
 No, it's not.
 We've looked into it and it's not.
 If you have any questions, I'll write down my extension for you.
 Do you need a pen? Nope, I've kind of gotten used to it.
 You dont have pens? We're not in a recession.
 Boy, we've got to crack the whip around here, cooter.
 You dont have pens.
 The roof is leaking.
 No, it's not.
 I'll show you the study.
 Hey, we have a meeting with the appropriations committee, like, now.
 Oh, no, I'm not prepared.
 I know.
 I'm not drunk either.
 But we'll manage.
 Mother! oh, I'm sorry.
 I dont know why I even came up here.
 I mean, I know Jack's not here.
 Boy, I am really going a little crazy! I dont supposed you want to be my sounding board.
 You're busy.
 I'll come back another time.
 Warrior, you have defeated the snake elf.
 Now join me in the orgy chamber.
 The poets will sing of this night.
 Stop, stop! It's not working.
 It's not--not you, grizz.
 You're doing great.
 I memorized all my lines at home.
 But, Jenna, you're not doing good acting.
 Dont overthink it.
 I dont need another judi dench situation.
 Now let's just skip ahead to the list of player sensuality options.
 These avatars need to be able to do anything to each other.
 Touch my cheek.
 Touch my chest area.
 Now give me a little robot.
 Touch my butt.
 Now like it's a secret.
 Touch my knees.
 Sexy, yes.
 Touch my knee spot.
 Good.
 Touch my feet with your knees! Now that we're in the zone, I want you to give me some random sex sounds.
 wonderful, wonderful.
 Let's take it again from the top.
 This time, let's record! Hey, Jack, it's Liz.
 Um, maybe you're busy spreading democracy.
 Anyway, give me a call.
 Things are happening! Our first order of business, the city of portland has requested $9 million to shore up its dam system.
 I cant support that.
 "Damn" is a swear word.
 I'd support it if instead of dam we called it a "god finger.
 " Randall, must you bring religion into everything? We need pens.
 Excuse me? Gentlemen, madame, we all know that rome wasnt built in a day.
 Well, that's one theory.
 But.
 .
 .
 we have a chance to make this country great again.
 We need hope.
 We need change.
 We need experience.
 We need pens.
 Kenneth, where have you been? I had to put on my jeans by myself.
 I'm sorry, miss Maroney.
 I'm trying to finish this application for Beijing.
 Did someone say "donny?" No.
 No.
 Oh, it's pretty muffled in there.
 You'll never get that application done in time, Parcell.
 You should just give up! I will not fail, Chief Errand Boy Donny Lawson! I was told there would be no nudity! That's the only thing i know how to say in chinese.
 Four and a half hours, hee-haw.
 Donny's right.
 I'll never finish this application in time.
 The personal essay is way harder than I thought, 'cause it' not in my nature rag on myself.
 Not even a backdoor brag? What's a backdoor brag? It's sneaking something wonderful about yourself into everyday conversation.
 Like when I tell people it's hard for me to watch "American Idol" because I have perfect pitch.
 Now you try.
 It's hard for me to watch "American Idol" because there's a water bug on my channel changer.
 It's no just? Oh, no.
 Someone's gonna get more attention than me.
 That was amazing.
 "Give us pens.
 " I mean, how do you do it? Cooter, I used to work for a man named don Geiss.
 He taught me how to be proactive.
 I'm going to teach you the same thing.
 I'm so happy you're here.
 I havent felt this energized at work since the two weeks where they tried to teach us farsi.
 Cool phone.
 Excuse me.
 Jonathan.
 Geiss spoke.
 What? He's not out of the coma, but he spoke.
 What did he say? He said, "Jackie boy.
 " Cooter, this is my letter of resignation.
 Would you make sure that it gets into the right hands? What? No, no way.
 What do you want to do that for? I just received a very important phone call.
 I've gotta get back.
 But we were gonna do great things together.
 Look, the leak's stopped.
 I have to get back to new york.
 This is my only chance.
 Resignation denied.
 You cant deny my resignation.
 Actually, I can.
 As acting head of the fbc, I oversee the ewpc, and I'm denying your resignation.
 You'll stay here and serve your country.
 The head of ge serves this country.
 He provides jobs.
 Fuels innovation.
 He brings good things to light.
 Cooter, I'm begging you.
 Please let me go.
 Hey, it's not up to me.
 Even if I let you resign, my boss wouldnt.
 They dont want people leaving here anymore.
 You're not going anywhere, buddy! Hey, the pens are here! USA! USA! USA! USA! Hello, friend.
 Oh, my god, you're pregnant.
 What? Yes.
 How can you tell? I just can.
 People always underestimate my instincts because of my looks.
 This is no time for backdoor bragging.
 I'm just so happy for you.
 This is what you wanted.
 Yeah, but not like this.
 Why not like this, Liz? As my mom used to say, "you never want this to happen.
 " Have you called Floyd yet? What? Floyd--you couldnt ask for a better guy to make a mistake with.
 Oh, no.
 It is Floyd, right? Those margaritas were strong.
 Can you come inside? I need a couple light bulbs changed.
 Pfft, yeah! oh, my god.
 How could you have slept with Dennis? It was before he tried to throw me under the subway train.
 Oh, my god! Oh, so you're the only person in the world that's allowed to make sex mistakes? You had a three-way with Roseanne and tom Arnold.
 That was two years ago.
 Fine, so I made one extremely unfortunate coupling decision.
 So what are you gonna do? Well, obviously Dennis cant be involved because he is a class "a" moron.
 So I am just gonna be a kick-ass single mom.
 Like Erin Brockovich or Sarah Connor.
 Listen to you.
 You're actually excited about this.
 Yeah, I am.
 Even though it's Dennis', I must really want a kid.
 Go to the doctor and get a blood test so you know for sure.
 And while you're there, try get me some adderall.
 I'm trapped here.
 I cant believe this.
 Well, I cant believe the best friend I've ever had would try and leave me.
 Cooter, look at this place.
 This cant be what you want in life.
 Havent you ever thought of leaving? Of course.
 Every day.
 Every day for two years.
 Look at these resignation letters.
 They're written in ketchup, dirty rock, leak water.
 And now you're here.
 You're here and everything's gonna be better.
 Now we've got pens.
 Glorious pens! Oh, my god.
 Oh, my god.
 They're caps.
 Nothing but caps.
 Cooter- that's not my name! My name is James Reilly.
 Cooter berger? What do you think I am, a cartoon dog? The president named me that.
 He gave you two nicknames? "Cooter" because I look like a turtle and "berger" because he saw me eating a hamburger one time.
 We have toet out of here.
 Now that's the spirit.
 But if they're not taking resignations, there's only one way out.
 We have to work together to get fired.
 It wasnt even a hamburger.
 It was a sandwich.
 Hello, Elizabeth.
 Dennis, what are you doing here? I dont have to explain myself to you.
 Look, I told my mom I got a job, so I've been coming here for the past couple weeks during the day.
 What? How come you're not at work? Because foot my computer-- no, why am I-- this is my apartment.
 There something you want to tell me? No.
 Elizabeth, this is Melinda from Dr.
 Bouvier's office.
 We'll try to reach you again later.
 I know that message and I know that tone.
 Every one of my sisters got that message junior year in high school-- you're pregnant! What? No! Really? All right.
 Prnatal vitamins.
 Yeah, I know what "prenatal" means.
 Pre, "before";  Natal, "ruined".
 Oh, my god.
 All right, first things first.
 We're gonna have this baby at the same hospital i was born at on Coney Island.
 All right? Oh, my god! Secondly, if it's a boy, we're gonna name him Morpheus like that guy in the Matrix.
 If it's a girl--ooh, yeah.
 I used to boff this chick named Judy, and I would love to honor her.
 Get out of my apartment.
 Dont talk to me like that.
 Morpheus hears everything that you say.
 Out! Your boobs are gonna get bigger.
 You must have been such a pretty monkey.
 What's that, miss Maroney? It's your personal essay, Kenneth.
 Ohhello.
 I didnt see you there.
 I was just thinking about my friend, Kenneth Parcell, and how much he personifies the olympic spirit.
 He's involved in charity work.
 You needed me, miss Maroney? Yes.
 Kenneth, can you take this money to the many charities I support anonymously? Of course.
 Oh, miss Maroney, this is empt-- he knows the importance of physical fitness.
 I mean, he can lift almost 100 pounds1 * Mind, body, spirit Kenneth, * * I see myself in you * * so brave * * so ready to be all that you can do * * so beautiful in every way * * I see myself in you * miss Maroney, thank you! I have 20 minutes.
 I'm gonna make it! I see myself in you.
 Oh, Kenneth, someone was looking for you.
 They need 12 boxes of copier paper on stage one.
 Duty before self.
 I will not fail you, Rainbow Chicken.
 whatever we come up with has gotta be wasteful, embarrassing to tion, and upsetting to the voters.
 Holy smoke! What have you got? In 1994, the pentagon explored the possibility of a non-lethal chemical weapon thque, uce enemy soldiers coosture by making them totally gay-nes for eaer.
 " How gay? It doesnt say.
 The project was abandoned in the planning stages.
 Of course it was.
 It would've been expensive, impractical, and offensive to both the red states and the gayer blue states.
 This is exactly what we're looking for.
 A guaranteed disaster.
 Like eating a burrito before sex.
 But where would we get the money? No congressman in his right mind would support this.
 Dont worry, I've got a friend in congress.
 But not your best friend, right? Yo, Frank.
 Oh, my god.
 Is that-- yes.
 It's just the prototype.
 But I want you to be the first to play it.
 Tell me what you think.
 This is such an honor.
 I got anadal filth by" credit.
 You earnt.
 Good job, Parcell.
 Too bad it cost you a trip to China.
 Wait a minute.
 Who's this paper for? No one! Looks like you only have 30 seconds to get your application to the 27th floor.
 And you're not gonna make it.
 Run, Kenneth, run! Oh, mommy! He knows! Oh, god, call me, Jack! This is a disaster.
 This baby's gonna have a father.
 Look out! What? A gay bomb? You dragged me out of a meeting for this? I was gonna meet bono.
 C.
 C.
- Representative cunningham.
 We'll keep this professional.
 I did certain things for you in bed that you were going to reciprocate, but then we broke up before my birthday.
 So you owe me.
 This could take weeks to get approved.
 I'll take my chances.
 And that would mean I'd be spending my birthday here, so.
 .
 .
 all right, I will help you ged.
 Yes! I am so on a roll.
 No crying in my bath tonight.
 hey, Jack, it's Liz.
 Um, maybe you're busy spreading democracy.
 Anyway, give me a call.
 Things are happening! Hey, it's Liz Lemon.
 Funny story.
 I think I'm pregnant with Dennis Duffy's baby.
 Thought you'd be super proud.
 Oh, in a way, it's what I wanted.
 Yeah, it's gonna be fine.
 He knows! Oh, god, call me, Jack! This is a disaster.
 This baby's gonna have a father! What--Kenneth just did a flip into the elevator! Jack, I've spent the last hour looking at cribs online.
 It's crazy.
 Even with all this Dennis stuff all I can think about is baby hair and converting my laundry and newspaper pile into a nursery.
 So I dont want you to worry about me, because, um, I'm happy.
 Oh, and yes, you hear me eating Sabor de Soledad 'cause I can eat whatever I want now.
 Oh, hang on.
 That's my doctor.
 Never mind.
 I am not, um-- never mind.
 Lemon, how are you? It was the cheese curls.
 Pardon? Causing the false positives on my home pregnancy tests.
 Apparently, Sabor de Soledad gets its special tangy flavor from evaporated bull semen.
 Oh, that explains your hair's thickness and shine.
 I guess in Mexico women use it to stop their periods before cinco de mayo.
 I'm a little afraid to ask if you're still eating them.
 They're so good.
 Lemon, I'm sorry you had to go through this by yourself.
 No, it's okay.
 I was actually ready to have Dennis Duffy's baby.
 I guess I'm getting to that age where I dont care what anybody thinks of me.
 If you're going to want to get a very short haircut, resist that urge.
 And I know now that I'm definitely ready.
 I want to adopt.
 Are you sure? What about artificial insemination? No, I cant go to a sperm bank.
 The Duffy men use those like atms.
 Then, Lemon.
 .
 .
 I want to assist you.
 What? With an adoption! Oh, good lord, Lemon! With an adoption.
 I know a lot of well-connected people.
 Okay then, yeah.
 Help me, thanks.
 Um, how was your day? Oh, it was good.
 The president gave me a nickname.
 The Jacker.
 Yeah.
 Three Months Later The Pentagon Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that the gay bomb could not be effectively weaponized.
 The chemical dissipates harmlessly in open tactical environments.
 And Frankly, could only work if somehow we could get the enemy into a closed, unventilated space.
 Ooh, pens! I feel weird.
 Let's do this.
 Dude, I played this thing for a couple hours.
 It's okay, I guess.
 Frank, you've been in your office for three months What? Yes, I'm gonna be a billionaire! Hotel Room, Beijing   

                




                    			Hello, pussycat! Really? Lot of ladies get right in the car after that line, you creepy piece of What are you I'm sorry.
 When did you get back from D.
C.
? How did you get out of your government job? I'm not at liberty to discuss that.
 That information is classified.
 At least until Cheney dies, which is gonna be a long time from now.
 That man is mostly metal.
 The important thing is that I'm here, and I'm gonna get my old job back.
 Yes, please come back, Jack! Devin is the worst.
 It's like he doesn't even care when we should have cake for people whose birthdays are on the weekend.
 The friday before.
 At lunch.
 What's with the outfit? Did that makeover show finally respond to your letter? No, I am dressed up because the adoption agency is doing my home evaluation today.
 Just be yourself, Lemon.
 I'm gonna be better than myself.
 My apartment is spotless.
 I have practiced all my answers.
 I got rid of all my Colin Firth movies in case they consider them erotica.
 That man can wear a sweater.
 There is no chance that I'm blowing this.
 Episode 3x01 "Do-Over" (1.
00) What can I do for you Jack? I know we've had our battles in the past, but I want to offer my assistance to you and Kathy.
 That's funny, Jack.
 You see, the only thing that Kathy and I need assistance with is deciding which John Mayer song to do it to.
 Come on, Banks.
 You sold off Small Appliances.
 Sheinhardt Wigs missed projections for last quarter.
 I hear that that theme park fire didn't destroy any of the stuff it was supposed to.
 Rumor has it you're in over your head.
 Well, you know what they say about rumors, Jack.
 They make a "ru" out of "mor" and "s.
" Yes, we've had some setbacks.
 But Kathy and I have everything under control.
 Don't even think about talking to her when her soaps are on! Seriously, she will bite you.
 You owe me a job, Banks.
 You know her father wanted me to takeover before he slipped into coma.
 If there's one thing I learned from you, Jack, it's keep your friends close And your enemies so close that you're almost kissing.
 So that's why I'm gonna offer you a job.
 In the mailroom.
 I'll take it.
 Great news, guys.
 I just got a residual check from that japanese commercial I did.
 I still don't know how that advertised Tokyo University.
 But I'm gonna use this $300 to buy us all some new boots for me.
 It's official! I'm a genius.
 My video game is selling through the riznoof.
 Well, how far through the "riznoof"? That's not slang.
 He has a speech impediment.
 You know you didn't make this video game alone, Tracy.
 A lot of people helped.
 I don't know.
 I think I did it alone.
 And this check is the prizznoof.
 Now, that one was just him being obnoxious.
 Thank you.
 I'm back, Lemon.
 Devin thought he could humiliate me, but he doesn't understand I worked my way up from the bottom before, I can do it again.
 Last time took me 22 years, but I know so much more this time.
 I think I can do it in 9.
 So you're gonna be a mailroom guy.
 I'm the head mailroom guy.
 I've already been promoted once since this morning.
 That's pretty fast.
 With a little hard work, I think I'll be back to VP status before I'm 60.
 And if my home evaluation goes well, I will be a mother by 50.
 We really can have it all.
 What was your reason for wanting to adopt? Thank you for that question, Bev.
 The world is a troubled place, and with so many children in need of adoption worldwide So, "infertility" or "other?" Other.
 How old are you, Liz? 37.
 I should tell you right now it's important that you don't lie.
 How often do you entertain gentlemen sex guests? Boy, that's once a year, maybe.
 But I'd be open to cutting that down.
 Is that a safety thing? Cause I can fix that.
 You ever run a webcam ring out of here, Liz? Gentlemen tell you what to do, you do it? At first with some feigned hesitation? Is that on the form? Have you ever been convicted of a crime? I was arrested once in Germany for public nudity.
 I thought it was a topless beach.
 It was a shipyard.
 You're a TV writer, Liz.
 How many hours per week do you work? Between 60 and 80.
 Is that a work call? Could be.
 Or it could be my annual sex guest.
 Your work life seems very demanding.
 Maybe I should pop by there tomorrow.
 Ms.
 Geiss, I have your soap opera digest.
 Kathy, this can't be easy for you.
 Your father, such a great leader, trapped in a coma.
 All this responsibility heaped on your young shoulders.
 With all due respect to Devin, he's a party boy with a grown man's job.
 He can't handle it.
 I want to be of service.
 Let me help you.
 Can I have everyone's attention, please? There is a woman coming by the office today No, stop it.
 Her name is Bev, and she is evaluating me for an adoption.
 Morons.
 I need everyone to be on their best behavior.
 No cursing.
 Please take down any pornography that you have in your office.
 Nothing weird.
 Come on.
 It's movie party Thursday.
 I brought in my tape of circus accidents.
 Please, a lion eats a sad clown.
 Tomorrow.
 Please just be normal-sauce for one day.
 And change that hat.
 Pete, I need you to call the set design guys and have them make the green room into a nursery.
 I may have lied about some stuff.
 I have a serious issue.
 I told you not to write back to your stalker.
 No, this is not about Yolanda.
 Listen, Tracy keeps bragging about all the money he's making off of his stupid video game.
 Meanwhile, those of us who did the voice acting weren't even compensated.
 I mean, I don't do anything for Yolanda, and she sends me those headless dolls.
 Well, I was not supposed to say anything, but he has something very special planned.
 I'll believe that when I see it.
 You will see then you're gonna be embarrassed that we had this conversation.
 Can I hide this box of penis pasta in your dressing room? Lemon.
 She touched me.
 Who? Kathy Geiss.
 She touched me in my swimsuit area.
 No! Kathy? It made me very uncomfortable.
 It's not all erotic and fun, like when men do it to women.
 Have you ever been sexually harassed? Of course not.
 Of course not.
 How far would I have to let her go to get my old job back? Are we talking over the shirt? Frontsies, backsies? Or would I really have to give her my gift? What am I talking about? I can't go through with this.
 If I pleasure Kathy to get my old job, I'm no better than Devin.
 The only path is the virtuous path.
 Even if it takes 5 years.
 I thought you said 9.
 I was promoted again this morning.
 I'm now director of mail systems.
 Nice work, Hornberger.
 Are these dolls? Are they? Mommy! They're called little creepers.
 Is it so wrong that I just want to have one of these to grow up and resent me? You will.
 Tracy, did you see that thing in the paper today about how Lil Wayne that's a person, right? Anyway, Lil Wayne, every time one of his albums drops, he buys diamond watches for everybody that worked on it.
 I know what you're hinting at Liz Lemon.
 I should get my rap career going again.
 All in due time.
 I want you to get presents for everyone who helped you with your video game.
 Especially Jenna.
 Noblesse oblige, yes.
 Let's go shopping.
 To the Batmobile! Don't worry.
 He's just leasing it.
 Good.
 What I'm saying is don't dress for the job you have.
 Dress for the job you want to have.
 So now, Manny Tomorrow I'll show up for work dressed as a mexican wrestler.
 Banks? God, what are you doing here? Where are your shoes? Damn it.
 Must have left them in my business meeting.
 You've gotta get a hold of yourself.
 You've got a company to run.
 I'm running it.
 I have a plan to quadruple profits by the year 2015.
 How are you possibly going to do that? The old-fashioned way, Jack.
 I'm gonna shut it down.
 I'm gonna shut the whole thing down for 2 years.
 I mean, imagine how badly people'll want light bulbs then.
 Are you insane? Think about the jobs, the economy.
 This is GE! It's just "G" now, Jack.
 I sold the "E" to Samsung.
 They're Samesung now.
 I was supposed to be at a board meeting May I help you.
 I'm Bev.
 I'm here to do Liz's adoption evaluation.
 Of course.
 I think adoption is a wonderful thing.
 And someday I'm gonna find them.
 Bev, hi! Thank you, Kenneth.
 So, this is our studio.
 It would be a really fun place for a kid to grow up.
 Lots of costumes and Watch out, idiot! Nice job, jackass! We're like a big family here.
 Hey, Rick! I'm Fred.
 Rick is the other black guy.
 Happens to everyone, right, Bev? Happens all the time to my black husband.
 Well, I first met Liz in 1993.
 She was fresh out of college, and I had just broken up with O.
J.
 Simpson.
 And can I just say something? Total gentleman.
 Liz is a really mature person.
 And she totally deserves to get custody of her kids.
 It's not a custody case.
 Liz is trying to adopt a child.
 Then who were those kids that you were yelling at the other day? Those were some child actors who had lied about being able to break-dance.
 Actually, I lived with Liz while I was separated from my wife.
 In a platonic way.
 But I haven't lived there for a couple months now cause I've been in anger management treatment center cause I shot one of my coworkers with an arrow.
 I think it's a circus in the Philippines.
 The lion goes nuts and attacks this older clown.
 How did we started talking about this? Did you bring it up? I'm so sorry.
 Would you excuse us for a moment, please? How is your thing going? Not terrific.
 I'm not sure that Lemon, I don't have five years.
 What? Devin's lost it.
 I've gotta stop him before this whole thing implodes.
 He wants to shut down the company.
 What are you talking about? I've gotta go now while Devin's in Connecticut.
 I'm doing this for the greater good.
 What are you saying? I'm going upstairs to doink Kathy Geiss.
 Tracy Jordan's not here right now.
 But he's great.
 It's a shame you won't meet him.
 Attention, everyone! Great.
 I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in making my video game.
 The most profitable thing since the War on Terror.
 Yes, I am provocative.
 Frank, for all your hard work, please accept this set of solid gold nunchackus.
 I will use these only for good.
 Petey Pete, for letting us use the sound booth, please accept this chinchilla coat.
 You're gonna get so much nice in that you're gonna have to grow another ding This is Bev.
 The lady from the adoption thing.
 Now, you look out for my girl Liz Lemon.
 'Cause me and her go way back like spinal cords and car seats.
 That's not really an expression.
 Mr.
 Banks? I thought you were going to Connecticut today.
 I blew it off.
 Nice to see you.
 Let's chitchat.
 What's that? Man trouble, boot-cut jeans? Fun, bye! It's imperative you keep Mr.
 Banks down here until I can get to Jack.
 Do you know what "imperative" means? Tell me, tell me! Important.
 It means important.
 I'll just be a minute, Bev! Mr.
 Banks, look how many pushups I can do.
 Devin's here! Cover yourself.
 You smell like strawberries.
 That's the lip gloss she put on me so I could be her fancy boy.
 Is this the way my life was supposed to play out? The kid who walked 4 miles every saturday to caddy because mother said that golf was a game for businessmen? Paid his way through Princeton by working the day shift at that graveyard and the graveyard shift at that Days Inn? my way to the top of this company.
 Thank God, I don't have your biological need for children.
 That would make success impossible.
 Thanks.
 This job was all I've ever wanted.
 And now it hinges on how far I'm willing to go with a woman in Dora the Explorer panties that were clearly made for an obese child.
 Are you sure she wants sex? Maybe she's just looking for attention.
 Her whole world is stuffed unicorns and soap operas.
 Aren't soap operas all about sex? No way.
 The best part of a soap opera is when someone's twin interrupts a wedding.
 Or somebody pulls a gun at the fitness center.
 Hold on a second.
 Kathy's texting me now.
 She's wondering where my strawberry mouth is.
 Nerds, it's Bev.
 Please be charming.
 Hello, Bev.
 I'm Jack Donaghy.
 Have you had a tour of our magnificent studio? I have not.
 Right this way.
 You're gonna give me that as "thank you" gift? some coupons for free hugs? I'm suing you for my share of your game profits.
 You're gonna sue me? Would you like to see the green room? You think you're the San Diego Zoo? You mean the nursery! We gotta get this stuff back to the rental place by 5:00.
 I love you Mommy, I love you! Dear god.
 Ms.
 Lemon, did you lie to me about there being a nursery here? Rick, what are you doing? Bitch, my name is Fred.
 This is very disturbing, Liz.
 This is a very serious breach of trust.
 Bev, allow me to explain.
 I've been mentoring Lemon for some time now.
 Are you her boss? No, I work in the mail room.
 Kathy, Bev and I are just friends! Kathy's the new CEO of our company.
 Bev, you better run! She's surprisingly strong! Frank, I told you to change that hat! God, how can I have a kid here? I can't even keep a grown woman safe in this place.
 "Unsatisfactory"? Are you OK, Bev? You had quite a fall there.
 I'm Bev.
 I'm here to do Liz's adoption evaluation.
 Yes, hello, Bev.
 Did you just get here? I'm here to do Liz's adoption evaluation.
 Where's my clicky pen? I get a do-over.
 No, we have to take her to a hospital.
 Do-over, do-over! She doesn't remember anything.
 You heard the lady.
 We're taking a mulligan.
 Let's make this one count.
 It's time.
 Kathy's texting me that Devin's gone.
 I have to go upstairs.
 What are you gonna do? Give Kathy the full soap opera while you trick a lady with a head injury.
 We might not be the best people.
 But we're not the worst.
 Graduate students are the worst.
 Hi, I'm Bev.
 Let's get started.
 Right this way! I know Liz would be a wonderful mother Because she's intelligent and kind.
 She reminds me of my own mom.
 Tough love, consistency, a little mustache in a certain light.
 And her other kids really like her.
 What? Well, I think I've seen everything I need to see.
 Man, do I have a headache.
 Let's get down to brass tacks.
 As a single woman with a demanding job working in such a, well, nontraditional environment, I'm sorry, but you're not an ideal candidate.
 But we did everything perfectly this time.
 Bev, listen to me.
 Yes, I work very hard.
 Almost all the time.
 But I feel like my life will open up and make room.
 Just the same way that my heart will open up and make room when I meet this baby.
 And, yes, this place is not ideal, but these weirdoes are family to me.
 And so if this job is a deal-breaker, then you tear up my application and I will start over someplace else.
 I wish there were a box on these forms where I could check off "passion".
 Because that is exactly the kind of warmth and assertiveness that we are looking for.
 I am going to reconsider your recommendation.
 Bev, thank you! Thank you, Bev! I'm Bev.
 I'm here to do Liz's adoption evaluation.
 All right, take her to the hospital.
 Let's get started.
 What are you doing? Get upstairs.
 Jonathan, not now.
 Yes now! Jack kicked me out of the office.
 He's about to debase himself to save the company.
 Don't do this! If you do, you'll be just as bad as Devin.
 Liz, what are you doing here? I thought you were at the fitness center with your twin.
 What? Liz, it's not what you think.
 Kathy and I are just working together.
 Kathy, you know my lover, Liz.
 That better be true, Jack, or I'll make both of you disappear, just like I did with Vivienne and Patch.
 Don't be ridiculous, Liz.
 You know you're the only woman I've ever really loved.
 Kathy's my partner.
 She's hiring me to advise her in all her business matters.
 Isn't that true, Kathy? I'm sorry darling.
 I've just been paranoid ever since that incident with the weather machine.
 Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! No, that's No, I don't think so.
 No, thank you.
 Got any mail for me, Donaghy? It's all over, Banks.
 Kathy has hired me privately to advise her on all business matters.
 My god.
 That's her signature.
 Well, I'm not stupid, Jack.
 I saw this day coming.
 But I've already made provisions for my financial future.
 Check this out.
 I'm gonna sue you! I'm gonna sue the entire city of New York! I'm gonna sue you.
 You can't sue me! I'm already being sued! Double indemnity! Lemon, how's your friend Bev? Unfortunately, Bev has made a full recovery.
 So, I have to start over with another agency.
 This might take a long time, actually.
 The semi-virtuous path.
 You won't regret it.
 Did you need something else, Lemon? I just like seeing you in there.
   

                




                    			- Is this important? It'll just take a second.
 Fine, but Mr.
 Donaghy is on another call right now and doesn't have time for a separate interaction with you.
 So everything he says will have to work for both conversations.
 Really? Lemon works for your business call? Right, I just wanted to let you know I have to go to Chicago for jury duty cause I never changed my residence to New York.
 Why not? Because I wanted to vote in a swing state, Jack.
 Also, I want to stay on the mailing list at Chicago pizza explosion.
 How fast can you turn it around? Who, me? I'll fly back in the morning.
 I never get put in a jury.
 I wear my princess Leia costume, and they dismiss me immediately.
 That sounds good for both of us.
 Thank you very much, sir.
 That last part didn't work both ways.
 You said sir.
 I think it worked fine.
 I'll have Jonathan call travel and upgrade your flight.
 Sweet.
 What do you take to fly? Candy and magazines.
 No.
 Pills.
 Nobody flies without medication anymore.
 Why shouldn't you enjoy the same luxuries as a dog? Comanaprosil? "May cause dizziness, sexual nightmares, and sleep crime.
" It's very good.
 Tyler Brody, on two, sir.
 Tyler Brody? The dude from the olympics? Yes, he was the silver medalist in tetherball.
 Speedman's caught an angle.
 Tyler brody is flailing.
 And there's the coil.
 Lance Speedman is the olympic tetherball champion.
 And Tyler Brody can't believe it.
 Boy, there sure are a lot of weird olympic events these days.
 Not that weird, Lemon.
 Tetherball we faked.
 What? Why would you fake an olympic event? For ratings.
 We staged several events so that Americans could win more medals.
 That's despicable.
 It took years of planning, and now Tyler Brody is threatening to go public and ruin everything.
 So, obviously, I have a lot on my plate and no time to babysit the 6th floor.
 So before you go gallivanting off to Chicago, make sure you get your people under control.
 Be a manager.
 Liz, Tracy is countersuing me.
 Good morning.
 For defamation of character.
 How can you defame someone who's been arrested in 3 different Chuck E.
Cheeses? Do you know who I am? Seriously.
 Please, tell me who I am.
 Jenna, I'm not taking sides in this lawsuit thing.
 It's ridiculous.
 Tracy's video game never would have worked without my voice acting.
 I deserve to get paid.
 Nemesis.
 Liz, will you tell Tracy I don't even wanna speak with him.
 Two can play at that game.
 Liz, could you please tell Kenneth that Liz wants him? That's not even OK, that's it.
 I am calling human resources and setting up a mediation for you.
 I told you.
 I don't drink that much at work.
 Mediation is a binding form of non-judicial dispute resolution.
 I watched Boston Legal 9 times before I reaLized it wasn't a new Star Trek.
 Liz, you have to admit this is unfair.
 I got nothing.
 Meanwhile, Grizz and Dotcom bought a boat.
 Cape Hatteras is lovely this time of year.
 Of course, Tracy takes care of his boys and not you.
 He thinks he can take advantage of you because you're a woman.
 Men think they can get away with anything.
 It's like when Adrien Brody kissed Halle Berry at the Oscars.
 No one has it harder in this country today than women.
 It turns out we can't be president, we can't be network news anchors, Madonna's arms look crazy.
 I know you're upset we didn't pick you for the gold, and I'm going to make it up to you.
 How would you like to host Deal or no Deal in the privacy of your own home? I think I'll hold a press conference instead, tell the world there's no such thing as olympic tetherball Or synchronized running Or octuples tennis.
 It's all a lie.
 A white lie that did a lot of good for this country's morale.
 Did you know that Bush's approval rating was almost as high as 15% following the olympics? Gasp.
 Olympic hero Tyler Brody.
 Olympic fraud.
 There is no such thing as olympic tetherball.
 They made it all up for the ratings.
 What are you saying? You can be the voice of Knight Rider.
 The film.
 I'm listening.
 Synch.
 : Collioure.
 Episode 3x02 "Believe in the Stars" (1.
00) I'm Jeffrey.
 I am a mediator.
 And you two are having a dispute.
 Now why is that? Because Tracy thinks he can treat me unfairly cause I'm a woman.
 What? Please.
 We're here because white folks think they can do whatever they wanna do to black folks.
 It's like when Adrien Brody kissed Halle Berry at the Oscars.
 White people stole jazz, rock and roll, Will Smith, and heart disease.
 Now, they think they can take my hard-earned money.
 Well, if we look at how voice actors are normally compensated Liz says in this day's America, it's harder to be a woman than a black man.
 Liz Lemon? That chick is dumb.
 Tracy, do you know women still get paid less than men for doing the same job? Do you know it's still illegal to be black in Arizona? Do you have any idea how hard it is to be an overweight transgender in this country? In preparation for landing at Chicago's O'Hare airport No, grandma, no.
 "Believe in the stars.
" It's like that doesn't even mean anything anymore.
 I'm sure I can trust your discretion about what happened in my office today.
 What you overheard was some rather grown-up talk.
 Was any of it real, Mr.
 Donaghy? Beer pong, jazzercise, women soccer? You're not in Stone Mountain anymore, Kenneth.
 This is the real world, and not everything is black and white.
 There's always a right thing to do, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Just sometimes, it's not the easy thing to do.
 Tyler Brody was not the only hero I lost today, sir.
 The other hero was you, in case that I got it, Kenneth.
 If it weren't for you people, I'd still be in Africa.
 Gorgeous, politically stable Africa.
 My people? Women are the oppressed ones.
 And it's even harder being a beautiful woman.
 Everyone assumes I don't try in bed.
 It's discrimination.
 You couldn't last one day in my shoes, Maroney.
 Right, Toof? No, thank you.
 I could totally be black.
 You should try being a white woman.
 OK, I will! I don't like where this is heading.
 Freaky Friday social experiment.
 It's on.
 Where is Liz Lemon? I don't really think it's fair for me to be on a jury because I can read thoughts.
 Dismissed! Welcome aboard flight 1876 to New York.
 Lemon, as part of our deal to keep him quiet, Tyler Brody's going to be on your show this week.
 But won't do any Tetherball stuff.
 It must be nice to dump your problems on other people.
 It is.
 Do you think Kenneth admires you? Sure, that kid looks up to everybody.
 He calls Tracy's lizards, "sir".
 Someone would have to be a complete monster to lose his respect.
 I don't know what we're talking about.
 We're talking about nobody.
 A hillbilly nobody that doesn't know anything.
 Hello? Tracy is a white woman, Liz.
 What? He's trying to prove that being a white woman is easier than being a black man.
 Wait, no, what about the mediation? We are way past that.
 This is gonna be bigger than when Tyra Banks put on that fat suit.
 And don't worry, when I prove Tracy wrong, you'll get all the credit.
 What are you gonna do? Jenna? Hello? Liz, it's Becky your college roommate.
 I'm sorry.
 Who? Liz Lemon, you're already treating me with more respect.
 Wait till I test this noise out on society.
 Minds will be blown.
 No.
 No society.
 Do not go outside.
 Do not let Jack donaghy see you.
 Tracis, listen to me Oh, boy.
 This pill's damn strong.
 You can't fix this, Liz Lemon.
 It's about race.
 It's about being a woman.
 It's about money.
 It's about being on TV.
 And no one understands all that.
 Hello.
 I'm gonna call you back.
 I'm snitting next to Borpo.
 Portland's got a fun little waterfront.
 You mind if I close this window shade? I'm trying to adopt a baby, but my job is making it impossible because my work self is suffocating my life me.
 I'm Liz Lemon, and I lost my virginity at 25.
 I saw the show about following your fear, it inspired me to wear shorts to work.
 It didn't go great.
 Do you know Tracy Jordan? I took a pill earlier, but I didn't get my september issue of O Magazine.
 Do you have the number for subscriptions? Why would you? That's blagh! I eat emotionally.
 And one time at summer camp, I kissed a girl on a dare, but then she drowned.
 And here comes some more stuff.
 I hate my feet.
 Once, I had a sex dream about Nate Berkus, but halfway through, he turned into Dr.
 Oz.
 Has that ever happened to you? A hug.
 This is happening.
 It's all right, Liz.
 I'm OK.
 Please stay close.
 Can you keep your hands outside my clothes? OK.
 Good.
 Kenneth, I'm a good person.
 If you say so, sir.
 But sometimes life is complicated.
 There isn't always a right answer.
 Say you're in a life boat.
 "You're on a life boat".
 The boat holds eight people, but you have nine on board.
 Either you will capsize and everyone will drown, or one person can be sacrificed to save the others.
 How do you decide who should die? I don't believe in hypothetical situations, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 That's like lying to your brain.
 You've lived a sheltered life.
 Virtue never tested is no virtue at all.
 I have been tested, sir.
 There are only two things I love in this world: everybody and television.
 But up in my neighborhood, we can't even afford cable.
 So my neighbor the colonel and I just watch whatever the old rabbit ears pick up.
 A lot of folks have chosen to go ahead and steal cable from the poor, defenseless cable company.
 But not me.
 As bad as I want all those channels, I don't do it because stealing is wrong.
 Kenneth, I'm familiar with the ten commandments.
 Ten? A lot of us women eat emotionally, and while we're not always in control of our feelings, we do control the decisions we make.
 I know.
 Of course.
 Now, you say that you want a child.
 And yet, you let Jenna and Tracy fill that role in your life.
 Maybe you're afraid of taking that next step.
 Oh, my god.
 That's it.
 Now that we've leveled off, I think they're gonna serve us a little snack.
 So true.
 So wise.
 You know, when you say that to everything, it makes me feel like you're not listening.
 Sorry.
 Here.
 Try this.
 It's wonderful.
 Salt water taffy from Rhode Island.
 Is this one of your favorite things? Yes, and I have so many wonderful favorite things this year Sweater capes, Calypso music, paisley tops, chinese checkers, high-heeled flip-flops that lift up your butt and give you a workout, and you Liz Lemon.
 Too many women are wearing themselves too thin these days.
 And what suffers because of that? Bowel movements.
 Personal life.
 Personal life, yes.
 I want to help you.
 What can I do? My god, would you say, "please welcome Liz Lemon"? No, but here is what I will do.
 While I'm in New York, if you want, I can stop by, and I can talk to Tracy and Jenna.
 Solve that little problem for ya.
 So you can concentrate on Liz for once.
 You are the best person in the whole world.
 Good grief.
 Hi, strangers.
 Do you think I'm sexy? Giggle, giggle, giggle.
 Tracy, I know it's you, and yeah, I do.
 I'm meeting my girlfriends for brunch.
 I hope we can sit outside.
 Lipstick! Jack, what are you doing down here? It's been a real crazy day, Lemon.
 We're bidding to build a wind farm in Turkey, I'm trying to convince the board to sell the locomotive division, and Kenneth is being a real stick-in-the-mud Well, there's nothing to see down here.
 Everything is under control in studio 6-H.
 Good morning.
 Wait, stop.
 Why do you have a monster claw? They ran out of white makeup cause I insisted they do my buttocks.
 Good morning.
 What is going on here? Jenna and I are doing a social experiment.
 No, you're not.
 Wait.
 What is Jenna doing? You gotta ease on down Ease on down the road Right this minute.
 Stop that right now.
 This is worse than when you wore your shorts to work.
 You realize this is incredibly offensive.
 And you realize blackface makeup reignites racial stereotypes African-Americans have worked for hundreds of years to overcome.
 Here we go.
 It's bad.
 I get it.
 Get some baby wipes.
 We're trying to prove who has it hardest in America, women or black men.
 I'll tell you who has it the hardest.
 White men.
 We make the unpopular, difficult decisions, the tough choices.
 We land on the moon and Normandy beach, and yet they resent us.
 Well, sir, I'm sorry to disagree, but I am also a white man.
 No, you are not.
 Socioeconomically-speaking you're more like an inner-city latina.
 The point is, men like me have to step in and clean up messes like this.
 You don't.
 I've got this under control.
 She's coming, Jack.
 Oprah is coming.
 And she's gonna fix everything.
 My, what was that? We've tripped the emergency brake, Kenneth.
 And I've hermetically-sealed this elevator car.
 No air can get in or out.
 Don't worry, folks.
 Help will be here soon.
 And we have enough oxygen for eight people.
 Unfortunately, there are nine of us in here now.
 One must die.
 In the panel where the elevator phone should be, I've placed a pistol loaded with one bullet.
 It's empty.
 Then you'll have to choke me with my belt.
 I will fight you.
 It's human nature.
 What's wrong with you? Oprah smells like rosewater and warm laundry.
 Did she tell you any of her new favorite things for this year? Calypso, paisley, chinese checkers, and sweater capes.
 Let's go to the mall.
 Did she touch you? Well, Kenneth, I give up.
 I thought pure morality died with Chuck Heston, but you proved me wrong.
 You are better than all of us.
 You are one latina fantastica.
 Hola.
 Kenneth Ellen Parcell, you are my hero.
 You don't mean hero like sandwich, do you? No, Kenneth.
 Not like sandwich.
 Oprah's coming! I haven't seen Oprah since she did that episode about the worst celebrity dads.
 Liz, your guest is here.
 Oprah! Hello, Liz Lemon! How you doing? What were you on? That's a kid.
 That does explain some of the stuff she said.
 I get to fly first class because my mom's a flight attendant.
 I lost my headgear at Six Flags.
 My boyfriend's in ninth grade.
 It's not Oprah.
 I thought it was Oprah.
 It's a spunky little tween.
 As I'm sure Liz has told you, I am Pam.
 I'm a middle school class vice president, a certified and trained baby sitter, and I recently got internet in my room.
 I think I gave her wine.
 I believe I can achieve anything.
 So Let's get down to solving this problem.
 Which one of you is Janna? Did you have a good night, Kenneth? Oh, yes, sir.
 Hardly any screaming from the colonel.
 Actually, I was thinking, we all try to be perfect, but the world maybe, well What I'm trying to say There's a whole channel on the cable that just tells you what's on the other channels.
 I know, Kenneth.
 It's OK.
 I'm glad I'm not a white man, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Is Spongebob Squarepants supposed to be terrifying? You're darn right he is, Kenneth.
 I knew it.
 Yesterday, Liz and I realized that she's probably wearing the wrong bra size.
 That one's definitely bigger.
 And that made me feel sad.
 Now, show me your emotion drawings.
 Tracy, your emotion is upside-down.
 That's the way my world is right now.
 I guess I'm gonna have to clean up your mess after all.
 She's 12.
 How did I It's OK.
 It happens to the best of us.
 In-flight medication is how I met M.
 Night Shyamalan until it turned out to be That was the best day of my life.
 Liz, we worked it out.
 I've been hearing, but I haven't been listening.
 And I need to stop being a frenemy and be your real B.
F.
F.
 Well, it looks like my work here is done.
 So, I'll see you at my parent's house for dinner.
 My best friend Gail can't make it cause she has some algebra test tomorrow.
 Gail Good job, Lemon.
 Good job, Pam, really.
 Be a white man.
 Take credit.
 Lean on me When you're not strong We're not doing that now.
 Stop that.
 Do you hear me? I don't think I should be drinking this.
 Come on.
 Like you never have a drink? Well, I did have some champagne at my cousin's wedding once.
 Yeah, you did! To Oprah! My name is Pam.
   

                




                    			Miss Lemon! It's me, Kenneth Parcell, the page.
 You probably didn't recognize me in this new page uniform.
 I recognize you.
 The old uniforms were timeless, practical, sexy.
 But this! This is an outrage.
 You need to make them go back to the old uniform.
 I don't have that kind of authority.
 Then what do you do? I just got a call from security.
 What? That's ridiculous.
 Why would I steal a file from personnel? What? No! Claire is in the lobby.
 Claire Harper? From Chicago? Yep.
 Fun, crazy Claire.
 Man, do you remember that night we all danced in that open fire hydrant? Yeah.
 Her roof parties.
 Karaoke in Boystown.
 The all-night scavenger hunts.
 Do you remember when we crashed that polish wedding? She's exhausting.
 I know.
 She's gonna make us buy more of her homemade jewelry.
 Birds always attack me when I wear it.
 I'm not letting her drag me out to some club tonight.
 I'm too old for that.
 Up or down, ladies? Neither.
 We're waiting for our old roommate.
 She's like a human macarena Something everyone did at parties in 1996.
 Me-ow! Right, that was harsh.
 No, Mi Au She owns the largest alternative energy company in Asia.
 So as part of our green initiative, we're doing a reality show about her quest to find a boyfriend.
 Here comes Claire.
 I'm already tired.
 Surprise! I'm designing hats now.
 Claire, this is my boss, Jack Donaghy.
 Hi, there.
 Welcome to New York.
 Let's see we're using credit cards and cabs now, all galleries have moved to Chelsea, we're off cupcakes, back to doughnuts.
 Would you excuse me for a moment? So, girls, what are we doing tonight? You know, the baggage handler told me about this storage unit party on the Lower Eastside.
 Starts about midnight, sponsored by Myirt Vodka, and some drug dealer of some kind, but the only rule is that we all have to dj.
 I mean, it's gonna be so much fun! Synch.
 : Collioure.
 Episode 3x03: "The One with the Cast of Night Court" What's wrong, Ken? You got wife eyes.
 I'm just sad, sir.
 I've worn this old jacket since 19 And now they're just throwin' it away.
 Is there nothing sacred? Have we lost our moral center? It just makes me wanna pee on someone.
 And I appreciate that, sir.
 But rules are rules.
 I'm gonna have to live with it.
 I hate to see you like this, Ken doll.
 It's like a owl without a graduation cap Heartbreaking.
 So what can I buy you to make you happy? The things I want don't have a price tag, sir.
 Well, money can't buy a sunset or a child's smile or a satisfying finale to the hit NBC television series Night Court.
 Court? At night? I'm already laughing.
 Tell me more.
 Well, Night Court was supposed to end with a wedding between Christine and Harry.
 But it didn't get a 10th season, so that great love story was left untold.
 So you never got closure with those be-loved characters? Did you see our shout-out in Variety? They called us a comedy show.
 I ran into your friend Claire on the elevator.
 She is very pretty.
 No, she's nuts when it comes to guys.
 We had a name for her back in Chicago.
 It's too rude to say out loud.
 "Crazyputty"? No.
 She's psycho.
 She is Fatal Attraction.
 She is staunchly in favor of cocoa puffs.
 Do not sleep with her.
 I wish you'd told me that an hour ago.
 What? Jack was just Giving me directions to the "F train".
 So, are we still on for tonight? Because it's going to be epic.
 I can't.
 I volunteer at a thing with kids and old people.
 Bring 'em! See ya.
 What were you thinking? Some woman known for 10 seconds in the elevator? I don't see what the problem is.
 This is objectively awesome.
 You don't understand.
 For her, sex is not something that you have to do after the 12th date.
 She uses it to suck men in and bleed them dry.
 Back in Chicago, I saw her take powerful men down.
 Didn't matter if it was Scottie Pippen or the drummer for the Bodeans or someone else's boyfriend who ran a small but prestigious clowning academy.
 Whose boyfriend? I get it.
 The fun, pretty girl who got the guys.
 Some of them yours? No.
 Listen to me.
 She's not fun.
 She's just crazy.
 Like grab-a-cop's-gun crazy.
 Having known Claire for a very enjoyable 20 minutes and you for what feels like infinity, I'm gonna go with Claire on this one.
 Ready for your big surprise? Yes, sir.
 Last time I was blindfolded was when I had to play the piano at that weird masquerade party.
 Some of the cast of Night Court! That's right, K.
 And they're here for you.
 This is the sick kid you were telling us about? Bless your heart.
 Do you like race cars? I do! Thank you, Mr.
 Jordan.
 This is the greatest day of my life.
 First I find that quarter this morning I lost a quarter.
 Earlier.
 Everyone, to Mi Au.
 May tonight's fundraiser for your fundraising foundation be as successful as last week's cocktail reception for your rehab center.
 Jack's just being modest.
 He won't tell you But I will.
 Today Is Jack's birthday! Hit it, boys! Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday Dear Jackie bear Happy birthday to him.
 Introduce me to this charming young woman.
 I'm his life coach, Esmeralda Fitzmonster.
 Would you excuse us just for a moment? How did you get in here? First of all, it's not even my birthday.
 I know, isn't it funny? What? Come on.
 Are you mad? I'm just being fun and spontaneous! This is highly inappropriate.
 I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
 If I kill myself, it's all your fault! You were right about Claire.
 She crashed Mi Au's party.
 Did she do sexy birthday or mannequin who comes to life? Sexy birthday, thank god! This is bad.
 I need your help.
 When we were having sex at the palace, she told me she loved me.
 You did it again? Quick and in the meat locker.
 That's OK, right? What's wrong with you men? You're like junkies.
 Why can't you just say no? Let me explain something that you have no way of knowing.
 Emotionally unstable women are fantastic in the sack.
 I mean, their self-loathing translates into Never mind.
 I've gotta get out of this.
 What do other guys do? Well, one guy died.
 Scottie Pippen requested a trade to Houston.
 Houston's too humid.
 What about this died thing? Where is she now? Chained to the radiator in her hotel room.
 It was her idea.
 She's an amazing woman.
 I need to keep you two separated.
 I can't believe I'm gonna say this.
 I will go clubbing with Claire.
 I will attempt a hairdo.
 I will wear high heels.
 Claire's wearing high heels right now.
 Go home junkie.
 I'm cutting off your supply.
 She's leaving thursday.
 Do you think you can make it through one night? Just gotta hack it.
 My boy Ken's written a masterpiece, and trust me, I use that word a lot.
 I just want to thank y'all for making this dream come true for me.
 Finally giving America what it wants A reunion of friends from Night Court.
 And the wedding of Harry and Christine.
 Before we begin, I would just like to say how special it is to be with you all again, my very special family.
 I just wish the brilliant John Larroquette could be here as well.
 You know, he really did wanna come, but he couldn't work the schedule out.
 You and John still talk? We stay in touch, yeah.
 Did he mention me? You came up, Markie.
 You always come up, Markie.
 Well, of course I come up at your little boys' club.
 You always thought you were better than me cause you were nominated for Emmys.
 I would have been nominated too, but I was too hot to be taken seriously! That wouldn't be a problem now, would it? Court is adjourned.
 This is worse than the original finale.
 What are we gonna do? I don't know, but this is bad.
 I wish this were an episode of Night Court, 'cause then there'd be some big joke right now.
 That is so hot! You just look good in everything.
 I wanna buy some hats.
 You're selling hats in the office.
 I am, and I didn't ask because I knew you'd say yes.
 So what's the haps? What are we doing tonight, hitting a clizzub with Jenna? You know I'd love to, but I kinda have tentative plans.
 What, with Jack? Come on.
 He's like, the first guy you met here.
 Roll with us tonight, and you will meet someone even hotter.
 Really? Guaranteed.
 I was at this club last week called Chili's, and I met this smoking guy He was just raw.
 Tell me everything.
 I'm going to.
 He was wearing this shirt, and I could totally see his nips.
 And he was very muscular.
 Really? Did you go home with him? Yes.
 To his loft.
 Where he gave me the business.
 So let's go dancing in high heels! God! OK, I'm gonna do it.
 I'm gonna blow off Jack.
 Where should we go? You guy should go to Aquarium.
 It's this new night club and all the women are in a glass room in the center of the dance floor, and all the guys just watch and feed them.
 That sounds so hot! Yes.
 Thank you, very helpful.
 Thank you.
 So helpful.
 You have to go through with this wedding, Harry.
 It means the world to my boy Ken.
 I am game, but it's Markie.
 She will not let go of the past.
 So you and Markeline have bad blood.
 But it's bigger than that.
 My boy Kenneth is going through some really tough times.
 They're trying to make him wear a coat different than his other coat.
 You won't regret this, Harry.
 You look great.
 Markie, will you do me the honor of becoming my fake wife so we can get our money and get the hell outta here? I've waited 15 years to hear you say those words.
 It's happening.
 Nothing can go wrong now.
 There you are! Why did you leave? I think those persian guys wanted us to make out together.
 I'm waiting for Claire.
 She texted me like an hour ago and said that she was getting on the F train.
 What is it? She's in your house.
 Don't be ridiculous.
 The alarm is I made you a white pizza and a pot roast.
 Because I just think you're so amazing! Look at me playing house! God, you must think I'm out of my mind.
 Do you? You just looked away when I said that.
 I saw you.
 No.
 Just kiss me.
 I know your lips will be honest.
 I've gotta call you back.
 Now, when we left off, Christine was stuck in the elevator, Mac had two dates on the same night, and Harry just discovered he was adopted.
 So, let's turn to page 2.
 Well, well, well.
 A Night Court reunion.
 Funny how I wasn't invited.
 Or had you forgotten about my 3 episode arc as public defender Sparky Monroe? No, we remember, Jenna.
 You were the werewolf lawyer.
 I can prove my client is innocent.
 If only it weren't a full moon! You made us jump the shark.
 You're the reason we didn't have a 10th season! I had just bought my second home when they brought that idiot werewolf in.
 That idiot werewolf paid for my hand reduction surgery, OK? I can't believe you're such a Night Court fan and didn't know I played the werelawyer.
 I knew.
 Very well.
 I can take a hint.
 But you haven't seen the last of Sparky Monroe! Liz, help me! Jack, what happened last night? Why are you wearing that hat? I don't know.
 You did it again? I can't help it.
 I'm under a lot of pressure, and Claire's my escape.
 She's like a drug.
 I crave her all time, even though she's bad for me.
 And my teeth are getting loose! I don't think I can get outta this.
 Maybe Claire is right.
 Maybe if we have a baby together things will calm down.
 This is what she does.
 She sucks you into her craziness, and you have to fight it.
 You have to step up and end this! I'm scared, Lemon.
 I'll do whatever you say.
 What a surprise.
 What are you two chattin' about? Actually, we were talking about you, and Jack has something he'd like to tell you.
 I do I'd like to suck that ring right off your toe.
 Just gotta hack it.
 Please stop.
 Don't make that angry muppet face at him.
 I know what you were trying to do last night.
 You were trying to keep me away from Jack.
 And you almost fooled me.
 But then I remembered something.
 You don't like to have fun.
 And now your little plan is backfiring.
 And Jack is seeing the manipulative you.
 The single white female thing that you have with me.
 I don't have a single white female thing with you! Honey, you moved into my building! You wore chokers because I wore chokers.
 I like a choker.
 Yes! You dated that clown, Joel Sucheki.
 First! I dated him first.
 And he was not that clown.
 He was the head clowning instructor.
 I'm not doing this.
 I am only here cause Jack is my friend, and he asked me to be here as support.
 Yes, right! That is what I'm saying! We all want what's best for Jack, right? So why don't we just get this 3-way on? Right? I mean, that's a bad idea? All right, well, I tried to be the adult.
 And if only one of us gets to have him, I'm afraid it's gonna be me.
 You wanted out of this.
 Break the cycle.
 You have a choice.
 You can choose Claire or Claire.
 I would like Claire.
 Fine.
 I'm done helping you.
 And when you hit rock bottom, which you will, I am not gonna bail you out! I'm deleting you from my phone! Password? What? Tracy and Ken won't put me in Night Court finale shooting on stage tonight.
 What? I know! I'm the werelawyer! Objection! Here we go again.
 Tell me about it.
 The last time I saw either of you, there was a problem with the page uniforms.
 A problem that persists, Liz Lemon.
 Are you with network? How'bout if Heroes had this new character, and his superpower was close up magic? What? No.
 Big fan, by the way.
 You're breaking union rules, our insurance doesn't cover any of this, and you're potentially infringing on Warner Brothers' intellectual property.
 Shut this down.
 I want a different answer.
 Where's Jack Donaghy? There's no more Jack.
 He's dead to us.
 Break this down! Everybody out.
 I'm sorry.
 Can I say something? Absolutely not.
 The only crime any of us is guilty of is caring for one another.
 Mr.
 Jordan, who tried to cheer me up, these wonderful actors who tried to make a young man's dream come true.
 If there is a law against friendship, then lock me up.
 But if there isn't Then the show must go onward.
 Ken, you did it! You changed her mind! No, he didn't! Stop group hugging.
 Who does that? Isn't this great? We're together.
 We're in line to get into a club.
 I have my glow stick.
 There's no more Liz trying to keep us apart.
 No more drama.
 No more sneaking around.
 Or recording our intimate moments and leaving them for Liz on her voicemail.
 What? You know what? I don't think I know what this is anymore.
 Are we boring? Are we some sexless couple that just sits in silence at a fish place on like a sunday night at 5:00? Cause if we are, I will kill myself! We're exciting.
 We're having fun.
 You really wanna have fun? Let's do something wild.
 You like it when I get naughty? Where the hell did Crazyputty! Guy in the really cool hat has a gun.
 Drop it! Now! Has a gun! Has a gun.
 Run, Jack! She's crazyputty! Run, Jack! Well, it's been quite a night.
 And it's been quite a court Ship.
 So, by the power vested in me by the state of New York, I hereby pronounce us Mr.
 And Mrs.
 Judge Harry T.
 Stone.
 And I may now kiss the bride.
 It's almost a full moon! And as my first official act as a newly married judge, I hereby declare the new page uniforms at NBC illegal! I added that.
 I went upstairs and told 'em, if you don't bring back the old uniforms, I refuse to play the role of Mac in Universal's upcoming Night Court movie.
 What's that now? Thank you, Mr.
 Jordan! Are you OK? Thank you very much.
 Lemon, real night court is not at all like the tv show.
 Remember that tv show? I do.
 The hookers are not funny.
 There's a lot more sickly homeless people and terrified college students.
 Thank you for bailing me out.
 Claire threw my wallet down a storm drain.
 Lemon, I'm sorry I I'm just glad you're OK.
 Thank you for answering your phone.
 I don't know how to decline a call.
 Claire used to punch me in the face.
 Lemon, I'm done.
 I swear.
 Try this on.
 That's a good look for you.
 You like that? It's yours.
 A little Lewis Carroll hair.
   

                




                    			We're at a party, loosen up a little.
 How could I loosen up? I'm in Connecticut, I haven't eaten, and I'm stressed about an "away toilet" situation.
 Do you know how lucky we are? We're in Gavin Volure's home.
 He was the C.
E.
O.
 of Sunstream.
 I don't know what that is.
 Is this potpourri or chips? Cause I'm gonna try to eat it.
 Volure is a god.
 He was the first man to be on the cover of Fortune and Jet Magazine at the same time.
 Of course, that was back when Jet was actually about jet ownership.
 That magazine took a weird turn.
 These are not chips.
 Then he fell off the face of the earth.
 He sold Sunstream, and shut himself off from the world.
 They say he hasn't left home in almost 3 years.
 I hope he shows up for dinner.
 He's already here.
 Thank you all for coming tonight.
 Because of my severe agoraphobia and my debilitating wealth I am forced to bring the world to me, and host dinners for interesting people from all walks of life.
 The world of fashion, society, art collecting and yelling Why isn't there any good art in here? Come on! Business and historical fiction.
 Really? What if the Germans had won the war? And the arts.
 I'm glad Jack was able to bring you.
 I asked him about you after I saw your photo in the style section of the New York Times.
 Funny story, I was only wearing that cause fire alarm went off while I was getting a haircut.
 Well, you looked beautiful.
 And, as always, I keep one chair empty, to represent our unfulfilled hopes and dreams.
 Just kidding, Eliot Spitzer's hooker couldn't make it.
 I want to send my driver into Manhattan to pick up dessert.
 Anybody know a good place for cupcakes? I think there's a place Mcenroe, give me a break.
 I'm on it.
 also, don't over think it, Sara Lee, frozen, unbelievable.
 Sync.
: Collioure.
 Episode 3x04: "Gavin Volure" Mr.
 Jordan, what are you still doing here? I don't wanna go home, Ken.
 You know my two sons, Tracy Jr.
 and George Foreman? They've been acting really weird lately.
 Where you going? Nowhere.
 Those two have never paid me any attention.
 And rightly so.
 I'm a strange man who can't be taken seriously.
 Now they won't let me out of their sight.
 Maybe they love you.
 Nope.
 Look what the little one made me.
 That's cute! This is voodoo, Ken! Those two are up to something.
 Sometimes, kids act out when there's a big change.
 I know I was a handful when my family moved from our farm house to that militia camp in the woods.
 There is all this new money coming in.
 And it's not just from the video game.
 It's the tie-ins, the toys, the life-sized Tracy Jordan sex doll.
 They're selling like hotcakes in Japan.
 Well, you know what they say, money is the root of all evil.
 I thought that was just a tag line for my movie, Death Bank.
 I can't believe you're out of the game.
 It's like Picasso not painting, or Bruce Willis not combining action and rock harmonica.
 Don't you Miss it? I do.
 That's why I'm forming a new company.
 Here's the pitch, wind power, bandwidth, Chinese market.
 Oh, god.
 I'm funding the whole thing myself.
 Partners You're drooling.
 If you want in, I'll make a little room and pull some strings.
 This is the most exciting day of my life.
 And I was pulled on stage once to dance at a Bruce Springsteen concert.
 Welcome aboard.
 Just think, this time next year, you'll be so rich you can run for political office without having to pretend to be a fundamentalist.
 Jack, the car is here.
 Thank you for coming.
 I really enjoyed your cupcakes.
 And because my agoraphobia-related germ issues prevent direct human contact, I wonder if Carl here might say good night to you for me? Good night, Liz.
 I hope to see you again soon.
 Good night.
 Guys, listen up I just got a memo, saying that every floor in the building has to designate a floor emergency marshal for fires, terrorist attacks, Cloverfield monsters.
 I can't do it, because my head is too big for the helmet.
 So, any volunteers? No, but you have a big head.
 That's not a burn, I just said that.
 Hey, guys.
 Cerie, is my phone ringing? It is.
 You have, like, dog ears! So are you gonna? Hello? Liz, it's Gavin Volure.
 Hi! Listen, I only took that napkin because I wrapped some chicken in it.
 That's not why I'm calling.
 I just had a good time with you the other night, and I wondered if you'd like to come out again this Saturday? Are you having another party? No.
 Well This must be what the kids call "a booty call.
" I haven't been out of the house since 2004, and even I know the kids don't call it that anymore.
 So what do you say? Yes! I guess, right? I'll send a helicopter to take you to the train station.
 What the what? Well it's gonna be a beautiful sunny day today and we can expect much more of the same over the next few days.
 Authorities came to believe that Menendez brothers acted out of pure greed.
 The only thing standing between them and tremendous wealth was What? Say it! Their father.
 Jose Menendez.
 My kids are going to kill me! Kenneth, what are you doing? Hello, sir.
 I've been taking in laundry to make extra money.
 I just don't let myself read the t-shirts with off-color slogans.
 Laundry? I know we pay you a living wage, I fought against it.
 Yes, sir But I've had to send more money home lately.
 There are problems on the farm.
 After years of inbreeding, the pigs are getting violent.
 And the pig shield around the house has worn thin.
 How much money do you have in your savings? Well, let's see.
 $80,000.
 If you don't include confederate money? $4,000.
 I'm going to invest that for you.
 A friend has presented me with a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I want to include you.
 Mr.
 Donaghy! Thank you, sir.
 After I invest this money, you'll be able to buy your folks a pig moat.
 Well, that would be great if pigs weren't excellent swimmers.
 Gavin Volure just called and asked me out.
 I mean, in for the weekend.
 I thought he might.
 He asked if we were involved, I said you used to have a thing for me, but you were getting over it.
 That is what's happening, right? Yeah.
 Listen I kind of told him I'd go.
 You should, what's the problem? I don't know, I'm still tired from that dinner.
 And meeting someone new All the nodding and smiling and sibling listing.
 And what's the upside? It works and you have to have a bunch of sex? Lemon, what do you want? Do you want to be alone for the rest of your life? No, I just wish I could start a relationship about 12 years in, when you really don't have to try anymore and you can just sit around together and goof on TV shows, and then go to bed without anybody trying any funny business.
 Don't over-think this.
 Gavin is a fabulous guy.
 If I were dating a man, he would be top of my list with Michael Jordan, Denzel Washington, Taye Diggs God, do I have a black thing? I do like him.
 You're gonna go to Gavin's, and work this thing like a Chinese gymnast.
 Wear something tight, force a smile, and lie about your age.
 Hey, guys.
 Daddy's home.
 Don't Menendez me.
 We made the hockey team.
 And this is the study.
 This is interesting, One of these benches is a priceless work of art, and the other is an ordinary bench from which to admire it.
 Which one's which? So you just never leave this house? I'm afraid not.
 And it does get lonely.
 I'd be lying if I told you I never danced with a broom.
 That's nothing, sometimes, to feel like I have company during dinner, I dispute credit card charges on speaker phone.
 Thanks for coming out.
 I know my situation is complicated, but I really enjoyed your company the other night.
 I had a great time too.
 So with your agoraphobia, how does this work? Well, it's not easy.
 We can never leave the house, and we'd just probably sit around all weekend and watch TV.
 Go on.
 Not much else to do up here but eat, and read celebrity gossip on Internet, and nap the day away.
 Really? And unfortunately, because of my phobias, we could never be physically intimate.
 I know.
 What woman would want all that? Hello, Kenneth, please, sit down.
 Sorry to bother you, but I've got another $10.
00 I'd like to invest.
 I did some street performing in my neighborhood this weekend.
 Kenneth, I'm very proud of you.
 Next stop, home ownership.
 Just kidding, middle class is dying, you'll be renting forever.
 Let's just call my broker.
 I just wanna check on that investment I made on Friday.
 All right, let's pull it up.
 That account was closed out.
 What? Zero balance as of this morning.
 I don't know what that hot tip was, but you'd have been better off putting that money in a coffee can.
 Hi, Walter.
 This is Kenneth Parcell, NBC page program.
 What's the status of my investment? Gavin, this was wonderful.
 I really enjoyed watching MTV Canada with you.
 They can't seem to get anything right up there, can they? I hope you'll come back.
 Maybe next weekend? I'd like that.
 Me too.
 I should go.
 Do you have everything? Do you have your cell phone? Nerds, where is it? There it is in the other room.
 Could you get Liz's cell phone for her so I can say a proper good bye? Thanks, buddy.
 Anyway, I just We don't have much time.
 What? Liz, I've decided I can trust you, so I'm going to tell you the truth.
 I'm not really an eccentric agoraphobe, I just tell people that so they won't know I'm under house arrest for tax fraud.
 And arson.
 The wind must've blown it shut! I'm searching for the key.
 Carl's a U.
S.
 Marshal.
 Come, before they shoot.
 I thought Derek was upstairs! I miscounted the men, Liz! I miscounted the men! Gavin, it's Jack, please call me immediately.
 Also that joke answering machine message makes me really think you've picked up, so I start talking, and then it beeps, and I feel like a fool.
 Your friend is a crook.
 He's under house arrest for tax fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering.
 What is racketeering? No one knows.
 And he's not a germaphobe! I thought I was helping him when I let him hold my boob while we watched Top Chef.
 I'm sorry.
 You should be.
 You made me go up there.
 Well, I'm going to fix this.
 I'm going to get Ken his money back and for you, I'm going to hit Gavin Volure harder than a bottle of whiskey in an Irish wake.
 Tracy, get out of the hallway.
 Or am I? God, this dream again? That's not me.
 That's the Tracy Jordan Japanese sex doll.
 You can tell us apart cause it's not suffering from a vitamin deficiency.
 Other than natural inclination to make love to yourself, why did you get this? To use as a decoy.
 So my greedy children will murder it, and I'll be able to escape un-Mendezed.
 This is insanity.
 Or is it? The parallels between the Jordans and the Menendi are uncanny.
 Both families are rich, both families have two sons, and both families are staples of court TV.
 Money does make people crazy, look at Gavin.
 And he doesn't have the life-long scarring of an absentee father.
 Exactly! You want to get one? I can get you one.
 You've got ten seconds.
 Sorry, but I needed that money for my escape.
 And it's all gone.
 I spent it on disguises.
 What about your billions? What about Sunstream? Sunstream is why I'm trapped here.
 It's not a real company.
 You watch our commercials, we never actually say what we did.
 INNOVATION TOMORROW AMERICA You can't be broke, what about this house? Government owns this house.
 I share with 3 other white collar criminals.
 Glenn, that's my peanut butter.
 God, you're pathetic.
 Creamy? This is not my peanut I'm sorry, Glenn.
 I know, I'm pathetic.
 But I never meant to hurt Liz.
 I Miss her, Jack.
 I Miss her laughter, her voice, the sound of her scratching her dry elbow skin all the way up Damn it.
 I have got a serious case of the Mondays.
 You'll have to make this things right.
 I will, Jack.
 I promise.
 We trusted you.
 I know, good point.
 And you betrayed us.
 That's wonderful news.
 Gavin, what are you doing in the You and me both, pal.
 I'll just be a minute.
 God, these acoustics in here are fantastic.
 Tomorrow, tomorrow I love you tomorrow It's only a day I couldn't get your money back and I'm sorry.
 I feel responsible, so I want you to have this.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, I can't take that.
 What would this country be if our economy didn't allow wealthy people to take advantage of rubes? That's true.
 But what about your family? Don't worry about us.
 We Parcells have eaten our share of rock soup and squirrel tail.
 But we've also known lean times.
 We'll get by.
 I need someone to be our floor emergency marshal.
 And you came to me first? Thank you, sir! Pete, doesn't that responsibility come with a $4,000 signing bonus? Yes? Right, I remember that meeting.
 Where you also said I would get a per diem for gas.
 12 cents a mile.
 Yes! Hornberger! Yes Hornberger Daddy? It begins.
 Daddy, are you awake? I keep having a scary dream.
 I dreamed that you would get so rich that you would leave us and get a new family.
 And never come back.
 And daddy I don't want you to leave us.
 Cause I love you.
 I love you so much.
 I love you too, son! Stop it! Stop patriciding! It's me.
 There's nothing to be freaked out about.
 That's just some Japanese sex doll in daddy's bed.
 Now, you listen.
 You don't have to ever worry about me leaving.
 Cause I'll always be there to take care of you.
 And there's something else.
 If anything ever happens to me, you and your brother are going to go to jail.
 Look! I'm not dead.
 Good to know.
 Yes, it is.
 Also everything worked out with Jenna's dad visiting.
 What? You weren't really around for any of that.
 Cast to the stage for rehearsal.
 Hello, Liz.
 My god! Gavin? We're supposed to be quiet during rehearsal.
 What are you doing here? I came back for you.
 I was free.
 I was across the Canadian border.
 No, you weren't.
 What's the scam? Do you want money? No, I'm not lying.
 I can prove it, look.
 Cheap cholesterol medicine from Canada.
 A Paris Hilton film released only in Canada.
 Camp of Approval? What does that even mean? What's the point of being free if you're alone? You get me.
 Come with me to Canada.
 Toronto was just like New York, but without all the stuff.
 Absolutely not.
 I thought by now you'd be some place that U.
S.
 law couldn't touch you, like Bali or Utah.
 What made you come back? Reason is standing right next to you.
 I came back for Liz.
 This isn't going anywhere, I already told him that.
 You've already done enough damage, taking advantage of her loneliness and her Big Ben-sized biological clock.
 Come on.
 I'm stopping it.
 I can't believe I'm saying this to the great Volure, but Lemon is too good for you.
 That is nice.
 It's over, Volure.
 Give me the brush.
 You stay back.
 I swear I will paint you.
 I am not going to real prison.
 I've lost everything.
 I'm financially ruined, I've lost Liz.
 That paint is drying weird, and now prison? Not prison.
 Not for Gavin Volure.
 What are you doing? Get down from there.
 Good god, that's got to be 15, 16 feet! Everybody stand back.
 Gavin Volure's going to jump.
 We need the floor emergency marshal! Everybody wanted to be Gavin Volure.
 Calm down.
 Don't do this.
 All right, everyone, i'm in charge.
 Does anyone need water or saltines? I would feel safer with some saltines.
 I had the money, I had the yacht, I had the women.
 I had it all, and then I lost it.
 And now, I'm gonna jump.
 Gavin, listen to me.
 I know you've had some setbacks lately.
 Glenn ate all my peanut butter! I'm not going to lie to you, you'll probably be killed in the first 6 months of prison.
 But that's neither here nor there, important thing is, you're alive now, which means there's hope.
 You're making a lot of sense.
 You have to pay for the things you've done.
 You're not making sense anymore.
 In spite of everything, you still have friends who will stand by you.
 And more importantly Perhaps most importantly of all Now, Tracy! What? But you're down there.
 Or am I? Good job, sex doll.
 He miscounted the men.
 You know a lot of people look down on sex dolls.
 But as we saw tonight, they save lives, and bring family together.
 How am I such an expert, I'm Tracy Jordan's sex doll.
 Alright! Let's do this!   

                




                    			Miss Lemon, you have several messages.
 Let's see, that company running the bike tour in South Carolina says, "no singles.
" Your credit card called.
 They wanna make sure you're the one buying cream soda in bulk.
 I sure am.
 And your landlord called.
 He said it's not the toilet, it's you.
 That's his opinion.
 Jean, from high school reunion committee called.
 They wanna know if you're coming.
 No.
 No way.
 You have to go.
 My high school reunion was so much fun.
 Hey there, Michael.
 Oh, my god, Phil Barror.
 Hello, Teniqua.
 You gotta go to your reunion.
 You get to get back at everybody who ever messed with you.
 You said I'd never amount to anything! Look at me now! Look at this necklace! Sir, this is a school for deaf girls.
 I definitely would have gone to my reunion.
 But the boat I was educated on sank.
 Well, I wouldn't have fun, so I'm not going.
 Kathy over here.
 We shouldn't have to go through this, sir.
 You are doing the job of the CEO.
 It should be you on the cover of the quarterly report.
 It will be.
 If her father ever comes out of his coma.
 Until then, the board has put her in charge, and we need to respect that.
 What if something happened to her? Something bad! Then we would have a secret that bound us together.
 What is she doing? I don't know.
 Either a weather event is approaching, or Get me Jack Donaghy.
 Episode 305: "Reunion" How come there ain't no puertoricans on Star Trek? They got every race and life-form in the galaxy, except for puertoricans.
 What's up with that? What is this, the local? He woke up! Geiss woke up.
 What? What's that flavor? It's Dove age-fighting acne cream.
 Geiss is awake? You're gonna be CEO.
 Yes! I was the first person he called.
 Well, his french-canadian mistress, and then me.
 I'm meeting him in one hour on the Edison terrace.
 I did it, Lemon.
 I got the brass ring.
 And I couldn't have done it without my lucky coin.
 Well I'm happy for you.
 You're having your reunion this weekend? I wish I had a Princeton reunion right now.
 Wipe that smug smile off Michelle Obama's face.
 Am I the only person around that doesn't like reunions? Don't tell me you're not gonna go! This may come as a surprise to you, but I was kind of a lonely nerd in high school.
 And if I remember correctly, you were a good deal more It was hell for me.
 I just wanted to be alone, but I guess every high school has people like Kelsey Winthrop.
 Liz, how's the telescope? The only people that gonna go to this, are people like her and her stupid friends, the cool, pretty crowd.
 Well, that's you now, Lemon.
 You run a hit TV show, you have very impressive friends.
 You found a hairstyle that works for you, so long as it's not too humid.
 And you're telling me you don't have the confidence to face a bunch of whittling, jug-blowing, Ihop monkeys? Jack, it's a suburb of Philadelphia.
 You will go and show that Kelsey Winthrop that the ugly duckling has turned into a vaguely ethnic swan.
 No, I'm not going.
 I'd never get a rental car now anyway.
 Then, take the GE jet.
 The CEO insists.
 They have popcorn on the plane.
 I want to go to there.
 Mr.
 Geiss, it is very good to see you up and about, sir.
 Jackie boy, I think you know why you're here.
 Congratulations.
 You are the first to know, officially, that I'm staying on as CEO.
 I'm sorry, what did you say? A beam of energy came and spoke to me during my coma.
 No, no.
 I don't know what it was.
 It could have been an alien, maybe it was God.
 Maybe it was an unborn Aztec king.
 But it told me my work here is not yet done.
 It's done.
 I think it's done.
 You're still my choice to take over when I die, if that ever even happens.
 Tray, why are you in your angry chair? Cause Kenneth got a bigger laugh in the elevator than me today.
 And where we you two? Your job is to protect me from embarrassment.
 Grizz had to go to the optometrist.
 Making up words won't save you.
 We're getting on the elevator with Ken, and you're going to laugh at my jokes.
 So glad I found you.
 There's been a change of plans.
 Geiss is staying on as CEO.
 What? A beam of energy told him to.
 That's fun, right? And instead of running everything, I'm going back to my old job.
 The standards department is telling me you can only say "cat anus" twice during the show, I'm gonna fight for you.
 You can say it 3 times.
 Cat anus, cat anus, cat anus! Are you OK? I have to be.
 What are my other options? Cry? Wallow? If I do that, Geiss and the beam win.
 If I control my feelings, I win.
 Jeez, Jack, tough year.
 First William F.
 Buckley dies, now this.
 Next stop impotence, right? So since we don't have the jet, I guess You're still going to your reunion.
 Nothing changes, I rented a jet, and I'll drop you on my way to Miami.
 Why are you going to Miami? Why does anybody go to Miami? Ass and the burgeoning art scene.
 I gotta blow off some steam.
 Come on, let's go have some fun.
 I'm sorry you're stuck in White Haven.
 Boy, it was something landing in this storm? Listen, about some of the stuffs that I said One time I laughed at a blind guy eating spaghetti! Sometimes I pee in the shower if I'm really tired! I saw my grandparents making love once, and I didn't leave right away! He didn't give it to me.
 All that work, all that sacrifice.
 Why did I bother? I know, but remember, don't let him win.
 Cat anus! I don't know who I am.
 I don't know where I am.
 I know it's not Miami, but you can blow off steam here.
 We have a lovely N.
C.
 Wyeth museum.
 Actually, some meth addicts burned that place down last august.
 There are excellent restaurants down on Cabot Street.
 The Vietnamese immigrants took over all of those places.
 I wouldn't recommend going to little Hanoi after dark unless you're wearing a khan dong.
 Why don't you just direct me to the bar? I'm sorry, sir, no bars here.
 We've been a dry county since 1880.
 It's the one tradition that remains.
 But do you like methodist churches full of Vietnamese? Give me the key.
 Elevator, what's this? A ghetto mating call.
 I didn't get the memo.
 Buy a guy a drink first.
 This place is bigger than my apartment.
 A Manhattan, please.
 Sure, what kind of bourbon? A white wine spritzer, please.
 Kelsey Winthrop.
 I think Danvers has a bar.
 To get there, you just go straight down Ngo Dinh Diem boulevard until you see a sign that says "detour.
" Now ignore that.
 It's a trap.
 And then you wanna get on route 9 going west about 30 miles.
 Does the reunion have a bar? Kelsey? It's Liz Lemon.
 Oh, my god! Yeah.
 Surprising.
 But cocoon, and then flap, flap, flap butterfly.
 I did not think you'd come.
 Well, I almost didn't.
 I was in Manhattan, working in the fast lane You made life a living hell for everyone here! You would have to come at reunion and make us go through it all again.
 What? I tried to befriend you just so you'd leave me alone.
 Liz, how's the telescope? I don't know, Kelsey.
 How's your mom's pill addiction? What are you talking about? I was a nerd.
 You were a bully! We were all afraid of you.
 We called you the White Haven witch.
 Lemon! Erin, no! Don't sink to her level.
 This is a beauty mark.
 But you thought it was funny to say that god pooped on me.
 I didn't think anybody was listening to me.
 I was a nobody.
 You were homecoming queen.
 I have had years of therapy Kels, your facial tic.
 You brought it back! You happy? And I still got the mulch business.
 It's hard work, but I'm outside all day, and I don't answer to anyone.
 Excuse me, can I ask you a question? Sure.
 Are you happy? Well, I got a boat, good friends, and a trampoline.
 You tell me.
 That's the life, right? What are you doing here? I'm getting drunk.
 Would you buy my mulch? I don't know, I just found out that I was a jerk in high school.
 Turns out I'm not the lovable nerd.
 I was the bully you hate.
 This is mostly spit.
 Hello, Elizabeth.
 It's Rob Sussman.
 Still think I'm "gayer than the volleyball scene in Top Gun"? No, we were friends.
 I just said that stuff to try to make it OK for you to come out.
 Come out of what?! I'd like you to meet my wife, with whom I've raised three beautiful dogs.
 Oh, boy.
 I cannot deal right now.
 I'm so mad, all I can do is dance.
 Even Rob Sussman hated me? He was the first gay guy I ever kissed.
 What is wrong with these people? Nothing.
 They're good Americans.
 Check this out.
 I just made it up.
 The three Bs: beers, boats, and buds.
 Doesn't that sound great? Are you having a stroke? No, all my life I thought I made good choices, but am I happy? These people are happy.
 I envy them.
 I wish I was one of them.
 Larry? Larry? Larry Braverman? I am Larry Braverman.
 No one has seen you since what graduation.
 Man, you are still, like, the coolest guy ever.
 You still got that old Camaro? No, it finally broke down.
 Yeah, from having too much sex in it! You bro! That's awesome.
 Let's go out in the parking lot and do donuts! You know, just like in the old days.
 Let's do it.
 Come on! Let's do some donuts.
 How is this working? You are Lemon, rich 50 is middle-class 38.
 I don't wanna be Jack anymore.
 I'm Larry now.
 That's one thing that Geiss can't take away from me.
 Are you leaving soon? Cause you're harshin' everybody's buzz around here.
 I'm not gonna leave.
 Sure, I said some dumb things in high school, but I have changed.
 I'm gonna turn this thing around.
 Show everybody the good, kind person I've become.
 Go home, Lemon! No way, new friend.
 We're the most important people here? Of course, we're actors.
 If we didn't exist, how would people know who to vote for? And people around here shouldn't take attention from us, should they? No.
 Never.
 Attention is what gives us power.
 If someone threatens that, you have to put a stop to it.
 Who are you worried about? Is it Allison from wardrobe's baby? What's up with that thing? So she can put her feet in her mouth.
 So can I.
 It's not the baby.
 It's Kenneth.
 Kenneth? Are you crazy? Come on.
 He knows his place.
 And he worships us.
 He does.
 Come on, you know we're the big dogs around here.
 Let's go throw a tantrum about the air-conditioning.
 That sounds really nice.
 It's me, Jessica.
 I can't believe you're here.
 You never answered my letters.
 I didn't know what to say Because of, you know The things.
 I hate the way we ended, Larry.
 I'm so sorry for what happened.
 I forgive you Really? Even for Especially for that.
 Say what you said to me that night at the lake.
 Guys? I just want to say I'm so, so sorry if I ever made you Really? 20 years too late and way too little.
 Would you please leave us alone.
 Cause we're trying to have fun tonight.
 That's my point.
 I've changed.
 New Liz is fun.
 I don't ruin parties.
 I get 'em going.
 Look, let's all do the Diane.
 What is wrong with you?! Could you hit four, please? Next stop, Kansas City.
 You are so funny.
 They should put you on the show.
 Did you ever know That you're my hero And everything I would like to be Singing in the elevator.
 It's like a road trip to the sky! 99 bottles of beer on the wall 99 bottles of beer You take one down, pass it around 98 bottles of beer on the wall Kenneth is a monster! We have to stop him! I want you all to know how happy I am right now.
 Being here with you people has helped me more than you can know.
 To us! Man, look at us! It's just like we're back in high school, right? You know what was always my favorite thing? You always got the bottle to land on me.
 Think you still have the touch? Oh, yeah.
 Do it! Come on! Come on, Braverman! Do it, do it What are we all doing? Just to be clear, we're not making out.
 That would be social suicide.
 Like I even want to be in this closet, at this reunion.
 It's a nightmare.
 A nightmare for whom? If these jag-weeds don't want to get to know the nice new me, then screw them and their rapidly yellowing teeth.
 You really haven't changed, have you? Excuse me? What happened when I told you Geiss had screwed me over for the CEO job? Did you offer your help as a friend? Or did you make some joke about me being impotent? That was, like, 8 hours ago.
 I was just, I don't know, cutting the tension.
 Or, were you hiding behind your sense of humor instead of engaging in a real way? Really, I'm the one that's hiding, Larry Braverman? There it is, right there.
 When you feel threatened, you attack.
 That's why you're almost 40 and still alone.
 At least I'm not 50, alone, and sitting on 2,000 business cards for a job I'm never gonna get.
 What did you say? Your bags were delivered to my room by accident.
 Look what I found.
 You went to a printer, didn't you? You paid extra for a rush order.
 It was your happy, little secret.
 What are you doing? Why is she so mean? What'd you do to Braverman? She's awful.
 She's the gay one! Here's your lunch, Mr.
 Parcell.
 Just the way you like it.
 Ham sandwich with the works, hold the bread.
 But that's my job.
 This studio hosted the Kraft Television Theater in the 50s, where young writers like Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling first rose to prominence.
 Mr.
 Jordan, why are you giving a tour? It doesn't feel good when someone does your job, does it? I don't understand.
 I don't like it when you do jokes in the elevator.
 That's my job.
 Lord, I didn't know! I would never do anything to hurt you.
 You're my best friend.
 We're not really best friends, we're just good friends.
 I just want you to stop.
 I will.
 I'm so sorry, Miss Maroney.
 No, keep crying.
 I want you to feel this so you never make this mistake again.
 And for traveling the farthest distance, it's David Messinger! We've got this plan to get back at Liz, and we wanna know if you're in We're gonna Carrie her.
 Like the movie.
 It will be delicious.
 And now, for best school spirit, it's Liz Lemon! Come up on stage, Liz! No, thanks.
 I don't want it.
 It comes with a $50 gift certificate to Outback Steak House I want to go to there.
 Wait Wait, we cannot do this.
 We cannot carrie Liz Lemon.
 Not OK, guys! We all know that Liz Lemon has her faults, but no one's perfect, I mean, I'm certainly not perfect.
 Don't say that Braverman! You're more than perfect.
 No, it's true.
 I've made mistakes.
 Sacrificed happiness for a job I don't think I'm ever going to get.
 We all have ways of coping.
 I use sex and awesomeness.
 Lemon here hides behind her insults, but that's not who she is.
 She's a good person Whom I'm honored to call my friend.
 Thank you, Larry.
 And I'm sorry I lashed out at you.
 You will need those cards someday.
 We're all so happy to have you back in our lives.
 But me especially.
 Because there's someone I want you to meet.
 This is your son.
 I am not Larry Braverman.
 I repeat, I am not Larry Braverman! I am Liz Lemon's platonic friend, Jack Donaghy.
 Come on, let's go.
 Once and for all, I want to say I'm sorry.
 You know what, suck it, you whittling, Ihop monkeys! Jet's waiting.
 That's right, a jet, to New York city! Lemon, out!   

                




                    			Merry almost Christmas, everybody.
 I have some great news.
 We are all getting Frozen steaks.
 Ipod nothings? Colorful sweaters? Nope, better.
 We are getting to participate in a charity program called "Letters to Santa.
" No, this is great.
 The post office collects letters that poor kids write to Santa, and then we go and buy them what they asked for.
 Look, we already did our Christmas charity work.
 Everybody here chipped in to get Sue a bra.
 That's much better.
 Sweet! Come on, nobody but me is gonna do this? Well, I, for one, think it's a great idea, because Christmas is a time of giving.
 Are you drunk? On the spirit of Christmas.
 It's this cheap, high-proof brandy I found.
 I hope it's not seasonal.
 I'll take one, Miss Lemon.
 I love helping people less fortunate than me.
 Where do you find them? There are these Nigerians on Internet that help me.
 Listen to this: "dear Santa, my name is Chanel Jenkins.
 "I would like some new shoes "so I can walk to school.
 "My dream is to be a doctor some day" That kid's never gonna be a doctor.
 Better buy it a jet ski.
 This is what the holidays are all about.
 Merry Christmas, everyone.
 I'm free, Lemon! Where are you? I hear sunshine.
 I ducked down to Florida for a surprise early Christmas.
 I showed up 3 days early, showered my mom with gifts.
 She called them all "adequate.
" It's a Christmas miracle.
 Glad to hear it went well.
 Tell Colleen I said hi.
 I wish I could, but she's off for her morning walk.
 And I'm off for a real Christmas.
 Fly to Rio, tan in the nude.
 Bet on some monkey wrestling.
 Just like Norman Rockwell always drew it.
 Have a good flight.
 I could fly there without a plane.
 Mother! Episode 306: "Christmas Special" Toofer, can I buy a kid Fubu? Is that a swear word? OK, while Fubu is not itself profane, I do think that Thank you.
 What are you doing here? Why aren't you in Rio? I hit her.
 Colleen.
 I hit her with my car.
 What? Oh, my god.
 Is she She's fine.
 Better than fine.
 They're giving her a titanium hip.
 Like the terminator.
 It's only gonna make her more powerful.
 Are you OK? How can I be? She's here, now, in my home.
 Some quack doctor strongly recommended she be around family.
 And Colleen didn't miss that one.
 Yes, mother? Why don't you try taking one of the many blankets off you if you're feeling hot? Yes, I know.
 It is hard.
 Life is hard.
 No, I wasn't.
 I was just scratching my head.
 If you need something, call down to the doorman.
 Yes, he does speak English, mother.
 Jamaican people speak Eng She hung up.
 I had to cancel my trip, there's nothing going on at work, everyone I know is away for the holidays.
 It's just me and Colleen all alone.
 One of her suitcases was just wigs.
 I'm not doing my usual thing either this year.
 Do you want me to come by later, and say hi to your mom? Would you please? Yeah, sure.
 I'll entertain her.
 I was just thinking in the shower this morning, what if Saint Nick was Nic Cage? Cause it might go, a little something like this Toofer, my man.
 How's tricks? That sounds more like Joan Rivers.
 Are you almost done? We need to get out of here Before someone recognizes me.
 I just have to get stocking stuffers and stockings! Wait, what is all of this? You have video games in here.
 And sports equipment, a TV? I just wanna make sure that Deshante, age 9, and Marcus, age 5, have a wonderful Christmas.
 Are you really gonna wrap all of these presents? Of course I'm gonna wrap them, cause that's what you do on Christmas.
 What you don't do is call your daughter on December 22, and tell her that you don't feel up to hosting Christmas this year, because she's 38, and you thought that she'd have "her own family by now.
" And that instead, you're going to a couples-only retreat in Arizona, the theme of which is "sexy at 70.
" Liz, you've never missed Christmas with your family.
 I know.
 But I have a new family, the Glovers.
 And I am gonna get them all these rapping Santas.
 I kind of assumed they would rap, which is racist on my part.
 But still, best Christmas ever.
 You're welcome, Glovers! What's so urgent that you could not wait until I came back from the front door? I need my other bell.
 We agreed, one by the bed, and one by the toilet.
 Hello.
 Hello there.
 So good of you to come see me.
 Merry Christmas, Mrs.
 Donaghy.
 I'm so glad you're here.
 I want you to know, and believe, that what happened to me in Florida was an accident.
 My son Jackie did not run me over on purpose.
 Case closed.
 And I don't want to hear another word about it.
 Of course it was an accident.
 No one is saying otherwise.
 The real tragedy is that the accident broke, of course, the Cartier watch that Jackie gave me early this year for Christmas.
 It's not a Cartier.
 It's a Chopard.
 Yes, of course.
 Chopard.
 Not the Cartier watch, that I wanted.
 Could I speak with you for a second, please? I can't do this.
 I know, it's stressful.
 Holidays are always stressful.
 It's not just that.
 Your mother's hurt, and you love her.
 Do I? Do I, Lemon? I waited 8 minutes.
 What? After I hit her, before I called 911, I sat in my car for 8 minutes.
 What kind of son does that to his mother? You were in shock.
 You froze.
 It happens.
 It was an accident.
 It was an accident, right? What are you two girls whispering about? What are you still doing here? Lutz looked it up, if we stay until noon, it counts as a work week.
 And NBC has to pay for our cabs to the airport.
 You made $300 million this year.
 And I'm not going anywhere for Christmas.
 Miss Lemon, you really outdid yourself.
 They're gonna be the happiest poor kids since my brother and I went to Neverland ranch.
 She went overboard because her family is not exchanging gifts this year.
 Holy Buddha! Who likes Christmas? It's gonna cost you a fortune to ship all of this.
 I'm taking it up there personally.
 I wanna see Deshante and Marcus's faces light up when they get it.
 Anyway, I gotta take this up to 245th Street and Lawrence Taylor boulevard.
 I will not let you go into that neighborhood alone in the spirit of Christmas and Kwanzo.
 Kwanzaa.
 And shalam-shizzam to you too, my sister.
 We'll go with you uptown.
 And remember, Dotcom, you are there to protect me, and not Liz Lemon.
 Guys, we are out of here in Five Four Three Two Exciting news, everyone.
 We are going to put on a live Christmas eve special.
 this year.
 This year, as in: "tomorrow", this year? That's right.
 Sadly, it will mean working a lot of hours over the next couple of days, being away from our loved ones.
 Our mothers.
 But we will be part of giving America the perfect Christmas eve.
 It's going to be so worth it, now, brainstorming session.
 Go! I don't wanna do this.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, as leader of this group, I have to put my foot down.
 Christmas is a sacred time for me and my surrogate family.
 So if you are willing to look and tell them we're not going to see New Kids on the Block at the Borgata, be my guest.
 You are all contractually obligated to participate.
 Yes, sir.
 I never liked that group.
 Sorry.
 This isn't fair.
 Don't take your mommy issues out on us.
 Sorry, I'm just trying to get through Christmas.
 Then what? I found a nursing home off Maine's coast run by the same French company that oversaw Napoleon's exile.
 She will be treated humanely, but there will be no escape.
 Merry Christmas.
 Thank you so much for carrying that.
 I will buy you guys dinner later.
 We both have girlfriends.
 This is it, 4D.
 I'm gonna need you to take a picture.
 You just push the little button on top.
 Thanks a lot.
 I never operated a camera before.
 I'm serious.
 That was very helpful.
 Make sure you get the hug.
 I brought these presents as part of the letters to Santa program.
 What just happened? What's the past tense for "scam?" Is it "scrumped?" I think you just got scrumped.
 Donaghy wants a Santa costume and a Mrs.
 Claus.
 Alfonso, I'm on the 6, you're on the 4.
 Come on, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
 My little elves at work.
 Looking good, gang.
 Looking good.
 You do realize we're going into quadruple overtime.
 So what? We're giving America the perfect Christmas.
 There are some kids out there who never get that.
 I know I didn't.
 Not with Colleen around.
 My dad was long gone.
 So every Christmas, she would bring her friend Mr.
 Schwartz over for dinner, and make me play songs on the piano, which she would sing to him.
 My parents divorced when I was 9 Every year, the dreadful moment arrived, when I would catch Mr.
 Schwartz caressing my mother's bony thigh.
 I'd say "eyes on the keys, Jackie boy, keep your eyes on the keys.
" They'd ask me to play White Christmas, and it would turn into some boozy burlesque travesty.
 Every time I hear that song, I get aroused.
 What is wrong with me? I have to Go to the prop meeting now.
 She's the reason.
 She's why it happened.
 So the overtime? Approved.
 It's Christmas.
 Next.
 Yes, finally.
 Hi, I would like to speak to whoever screens the letters to Santa.
 Then you better talk to that box.
 Maybe you could help me, Trene.
 Irene.
 I believe that I was the victim of a scam perpetrated through the mails, so There's nothing we can do.
 I disagree.
 I think there are a lot of things we could do.
 I would like to access any census information you have for this address.
 In addition, I would like to speak to the letter carrier You know we're closing in 5 min? Who services zip-plus-four.
 Never gonna happen.
 Can you help me out with her? Really? We're both black, so we must know each other? Did Vicky hook you up with this job? Girl, you better stop.
 You don't know the postmaster general, do you? I do, but we had a falling out over the Jerry Garcia stamp.
 I mean, if I want to lick a hippie, I would just return Joan Baez's calls.
 Are you wearing the same clothes as yesterday? I have no choice.
 I can't go home.
 Come on.
 You can go home.
 I can't.
 Last night, we had an incident.
 Jackie, sweetheart.
 Can you get this heavy wool blanket out from underneath me? I'm sweating like a grape picker.
 Come on, put some back into it Jacqueline.
 My other hip! I think it was subconscious.
 I've had enough.
 and feelings of inadequacy.
 I wanna be free.
 What are you saying? I can't be alone with her.
 My mother is like a virus, and my body is trying to get rid of her.
 God, she can't know I'm having these thoughts.
 She can't know about the 8 minutes.
 If she knew, she would have me arrested.
 She's done it before.
 The candy canes are for the show.
 So how did it go uptown? I'll tell you how it went.
 I filed a report with the better business bureau.
 I'm not gonna rest until the letters to Santa program is shut down.
 What is wrong with you? You are being a real Scrooge.
 It was just two dudes, Kenneth.
 They scammed me, and now they're selling that stuff on Ebay.
 There were no kids up there, and there definitely weren't any hugs around here.
 If all you want is a hug from a black person maybe you should just host The price is right.
 I don't believe people would do that.
 This is a religious holiday.
 When has religion ever caused any trouble? You're naive.
 And you're acting like a real c-word right now.
 That's right, a cranky sue.
 I know in my heart that children got those presents.
 They didn't.
 I'll prove it to you.
 It's dinner break.
 Tracy, we're going uptown.
 All right, I'll call Grizz and Dotcom.
 I'm sure they're not doing anything.
 Doctor Williams said "boundaries.
" Mother, you shouldn't be exerting yourself like that.
 I'm sorry that work has kept me from spending more time with you.
 What kind of time, Jackie? Eight minutes, maybe? John Francis Donaghy.
 How could you? How could you? Waiting 8 minutes to call 911.
 I can't believe it! I dunno what you're talking about.
 I've gotta get back to work now.
 Exhibit A! Your cell phone bill.
 You made a call to 911 at 8:16 a.
m.
 Exhibit B.
 The watch that my son gave me for Christmas.
 Not the one I wanted, by the way.
 You had just set it before it broke, of course, when your car rammed into me down in Florida.
 And it stopped at 8:08.
 Exhibit C.
 Sixteen, minus eight, is eight.
 Numbers, unlike children, don't lie.
 What kind of son What kind of mother tells her son that John Kennedy died because he talked in church? Or tells her son when he was voted captain of the diving team, quote: "what a great way to meet guys.
" Or invite strange men over on Christmas eve! Don't turn this around, Jackie! Don't make this about me! It's always about you.
 I am 50 years old.
 You have ruined every Christmas I've ever had, and I'm not letting you take this one down too.
 You're walking away from me! More snow machines! See, those drawings are a clue that children live here.
 Or Basquiat.
 And this bare door is a scam door.
 No, children live here.
 I know it.
 Get ready to have your little bubble burst.
 Come on, Christmas Hello? My gosh.
 Are you Deshante and Marcus? And you got the presents? There are presents under the tree? I did that.
 I got that stuff for you.
 I'm the one who made Christmas happen.
 What about Santa? Daddy, she said there's no Santa Claus! What is wrong with you? I did a good thing, I got a letter from The letter that said "dear Santa" not "dear lonely white lady.
" I'm sorry.
 Could I offer you tickets to a live Christmas special in the tradition of Andy Williams? OK, you were right.
 So you were right.
 You know your mother is here? I don't care.
 I'm trying to produce a Christmas special that makes It's a Wonderful Life look like Pulp Fiction.
 Where the hell is Mrs.
 Claus? You can't do Christmas eve without her.
 What is wrong with you people? We're on in 30 secs.
 How couldn't you have Mrs.
 Claus? I didn't realize you were serious so I cut it.
 You can't cut Mrs.
 Claus.
 Everyone knows that on Christmas eve, Mrs.
 Claus hangs your stockings, then puts out food for Santa.
 Then you sings songs around the piano until she tucks you in.
 Did your mother not do that? That's not a thing, Jack.
 Yes, it is.
 Mrs.
 Claus must have been something special that Colleen did.
 Probably to make up for the fact that your dad wasn't around.
 Christmas in the Donaghy house was awful.
 Have I not told you about my mom's yuletide boyfriend? Good old Frederick August Otto Schwartz the third? F.
A.
O.
 Schwartz? Like the toy store? His family owned some toy stores.
 So what? I think your mother put out on Christmas to get you kids presents.
 She did it for you.
 Not possible.
 She didn't do anything for us.
 I know you guys were pretty poor.
 Did you have a lot of presents? You couldn't even see the tree.
 Our first guest has sung with everyone from Paul Anka to Crocodile Dundee.
 Cross to piano.
 Ladies and gentlemen, Jenna Maroney! I know you're gonna be all alone on Christmas day.
 So if you like, you can spend it with the Jordans.
 I'd love to.
 Good, we'll be over at 2:00.
 My kids have a peanut allergy, but dogs only eat steak.
 What on earth is the matter with you? I love you, mother, and I don't want you to die.
 I'm never going to.
 And so I'm offering This simple phrase To kids From 1 to 92 Although it's been said Many times Many ways Merry Christmas Merry Christmas Merry Christmas To You You're flat, Jack.
   

                




                    			Did you hear? Is your brother gonna be OK? No, not that.
 A new movie about Janis Joplin is going into production.
 And Sheinhardt-Universal is making it.
 I know Jack can get me an audition.
 So I'm gonna storm into his office in character.
 I knew you'd be happy for me.
 Somebody's sleepy.
 I am sleepy.
 But I'm also so excited.
 Max, is this your baby sister? What a cute little girl.
 Or boy if you grow up and feel that's what's inside you.
 OMG, Liz.
 Look at you and me and our biological clocks.
 You're going baby crazy and I keep getting turned on by car accidents.
 I'm not baby crazy, Jenna.
 This whole adoption thing is just taking a lot longer than I thought.
 Where did you get that shoe? Not stealing if it's on the ground.
 So, that's the tour, Elisa.
 I think you'll find being my mother's nurse, a mixed bag.
 When she's in a foul mood, it can be horribly unpleasant.
 But at other times, she is asleep.
 I understand.
 Eldercare can be stressful.
 Especially when the object of that care wanders around at night in depression-era petty pants.
 You should've seen my grandmother in her later years.
 Do you know what kind of clothes old Puerto Rican ladies wear around the house? Me neither 'cause she never wore any.
 But family is family.
 And you're a good son.
 I do what I can for my mother.
 Somebody's gotta dry me off.
 He just left, Mrs.
 Donaghy.
 I'm coming to help you.
 Episode 307: "Senor Macho Solo" Tracy, your friends and I are concerned about you.
 We think your spending has gotten out of control.
 Give me an example.
 Well, you bought 3 hours of network prime-time for your salute to Benny Hill.
 You don't get it.
 I don't want to spend so much.
 I have to.
 I'm afraid Angie will divorce me if I ever have enough money for her to live off of half.
 So before she can get it, I have to spend it all on useless things like gold shoes and Grizz and Dotcom.
 She's not gonna get half your money.
 What does your pre-nup say? I don't got a pre-nup! When Angie and I got married, my only assets were a toaster oven and 2 tickets to a Young MC concert.
 You need to be protected.
 Let's bring Angie in here.
 We'll think of something.
 A post-nup, if you will.
 Something that will bring you peace of mind.
 I'll bring Angie in.
 But I'm gonna tell her this is all your idea.
 Don't help me.
 I'm too proud.
 Hi ya bunny! Excuse me.
 Hello, there.
 Did you just touch my head? Well I had to do something to get your attention.
 OK, you've got it.
 Yeah, I do.
 I like your tie.
 And I like aggressive women with a nerdy vibe.
 How about we grab some coffee and explore this? What? Howdy, Jack! It's me, Janis Joplin! And I want to audition for my Sheinhardt-Universal biopic so bad that I came here dressed as me.
 Actually I am me.
 So well, I dressed normal.
 But my friend, Jenna Maroney, she should be my understudy.
 I mean, she should audition for me.
 But I'm me now actually.
 Ongoing train wreck aside, I love this idea.
 It's great synergy.
 By putting a TV actress into the movie world, we can promote both.
 It's like we're including a Heroes DVD with every missile guidance system we sell.
 I'll call the studio.
 I'm so glad that I time-traveled here from 1969.
 What is that iron bird? They had airplanes in the '60s, Jenna.
 Right.
 Boy, I feel like I've just been talking nonstop.
 No, you also ate quite a bit.
 It's my fault for wanting to hear all about your job.
 It's so much more interesting than the U.
N.
 Come on, really? You got all the different languages, the costumes.
 And that big meeting room.
 It must be like working in the galactic senate in Star Wars.
 They are similar.
 We are also very concerned about the growing influence of the Sith Lords.
 Are you free for dinner some night this week? Sure, I'd love to.
 Sounds great.
 Who was that? A guy that I met.
 Is this part of your mommy thing? Only in so far as we met because I touched his head thinking he was a child.
 I like him.
 He's smart.
 He's funny.
 He's got a job.
 But you know what? I'm gonna screw this up.
 I always find a way to screw good things up, and this one is a mine field.
 Did I mention we met cause I thought he was a baby? He doesn't have to know that.
 He can't know that.
 But what if I say something stupid, like order a tall coffee or talk about my Nintendo Wii? You like this guy.
 You're a grown woman.
 Take a lesson from Janis and show some self-control.
 How far into that biography are you? Not very.
 Why? What happens? So let me get this straight.
 If I sign this and Tracy decides to run away with that chunky chick from Hairspray.
 Or any female of equivalent thickness.
 Then I get $8,500? That's correct.
 What do I care? I'll sign your stupid contract.
 Never gonna leave this man anyway.
 You're not? Baby! I'm gonna be with you to the very end.
 I'm gonna watch you die, Tracy Jordan.
 She's done it before! Forget it! I know you're not gonna leave me.
 I got somebody who's gonna watch me die! Tracy, let's not get emotional.
 This is happening.
 You could stay or you could leave, but it's gonna take a while.
 Jenna got the lead in the Janis Joplin biopic that I'm co-producing.
 And I want her to open the next show with a song from the movie.
 Come on! You can't fight synergy.
 It's bigger than all of us.
 Nice dress.
 Are you going to dinner? Don't forget your book.
 I'll have you know that I'm having dinner with a man.
 So Stuart, what is it like living under a bridge? I was just telling him about my new apartment in Williamsburg Under the bridge.
 The U.
N.
? They still have that? I could've sworn they turned it into a Barnes and Noble.
 Like you guys in corporate America are doing any better? Have you learned how to say "do you want fries with that" in Chinese? Senior VP for television and microwave oven programming.
 Stuart Lagrange, U.
N.
 High Commission on Water Temperature and Food Taint.
 And how did you and Lemon meet? Liz here just saw me on the street and went for it.
 Lemon did that? Yeah.
 You know me.
 Spend my lunch hour walking up and down 6th avenue looking for a hot meal.
 Classic Lemon man-eater.
 Cat sound.
 Well, nice to meet you.
 There he is! I owe you, Jackie D.
 When I'm on my death bed, frenching my wife, I will think of you.
 Please don't.
 No.
 Not again.
 This is real, people! This is not a drill! Let's go! Tracy, my back! Baby, hurt my back.
 I just want you all to know as I prepare to venture into moviedom, that an actor is only as good as the words My thing is on.
 Everyone shut up.
 Shut your mouths.
 Breaking news now about a new Janis Joplin biopic.
 Julia Roberts agreed to play the tragic singer What? In a film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by the best screenwriter in the world, whoever that is.
 The announcement is a huge blow to a competing project from Jenna Maroney and Steven Spielberger.
 That's right.
 Spielberger.
 Here's Maroney on a windy day.
 Don't turn it off.
 They haven't shown that good news you were telling us about.
 'cause that all seemed like really bad news.
 It's 7:00.
 Why don't I hear my mother yelling "go home" to the Asian contestant on Jeopardy? Cause she's asleep.
 Really? How did you do that? She fought me at first, but I find that authoritative rapid Spanish subdues white people.
 I'm heading out for the evening.
 I forgot.
 Somebody dropped that off for you earlier.
 Good god! Gold shoes! My nephew just joined the Marines to try to pay for college, but that's fun.
 They're from Tracy Jordan.
 I tried to get him and his wife to sign a pre-nup, but all that led to were pledges of everlasting love and devotion.
 It was ridiculous.
 What's ridiculous about love? The idea of depending on one person for the rest of your live is irrational.
 You come in alone, you go out alone.
 That's the saddest thing I ever heard.
 There's nothing sad about it at all, actually.
 I've a great life.
 Tonight I'm going out with a Fox News correspondent.
 We'll have some dinner, some laughs, some sex.
 Not necessarily in that order.
 But I'm not counting on spending the rest of my life with her.
 So what's your plan? Get old, die alone in an empty room with your gold shoes? That's what happens to most of us.
 At least I'm prepared.
 Without getting into specifics, my exit involves a McFlurry machine and a video tape of risqué commercials from overseas.
 I don't even know what to say to that.
 Except that in Puerto Rico, a McFlurry, it's called a Senor Flurry.
 This guy makes badhushas.
 They're like an indian donut.
 They're amazing.
 Careful, buddy, it's hot! Are you trying to pick me up to keep me from touching fire? Kiss me.
 Wait a minute.
 When you first met me, did you think I was a child? Yes, I did, sir.
 Unbelievable.
 I should've listened to my friends.
 Kofi said you were too good to be true.
 Na Ha told me to wait 3 days before I called you.
 And yet here we are.
 Was anything even going to happen between us tonight? But not because of your size.
 It's because I have a thing about intimacy.
 I'm the weird one.
 I'm weirder than you.
 How am I weird? You're not.
 That came out wrong.
 You came out wrong.
 And I lied about your show.
 I have seen it.
 Be careful crossing the The lady will be having the tasting menu but with some substitutions.
 Instead of any of it, she'll have a cup of hot water with a chicken bone in it and a bowl of salted ice cubes.
 A towel, sir? I have something on my ball.
 Mint? Good morning.
 Morning, everyone.
 Are you all right? You look very pale.
 I'm fine.
 I had a good hour of sleep last night, took a few showers.
 There anything you want to talk about? I am a nurse.
 It's nothing.
 It's embarrassing.
 More embarrassing than your CD collection? I didn't know Michael Buble had so many albums.
 If you must know, I found a lump.
 On your testicle? Let me see it.
 No, thank you.
 I think I have it under control.
 What? You're talking so fast.
 Is that the subjunctive? How did you do that? I told you I was a professional.
 And you forgot to put on your underpants.
 So any big plans for your day off? I'm going to Prospect Park.
 It's my goddaughter's quincenera.
 It's kind of like a debutante ball.
 You did that on purpose.
 I did.
 Well there is something there.
 Could be a number of things.
 You should get it checked out by a doctor.
 Thank you for telling me what I already know.
 You should work for the Huffington Post.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sure you have friends or family you can call.
 I'm fine.
 Please.
 Don't try to be senor macho solo.
 Which is actually what we call a McRib sandwich.
 I'm fine.
 I'm handling this all alone.
 Jack, what are we doing about this Julia Roberts movie? Aren't people over her? I mean, come on! You're single like me.
 Do you think we need some mythical soul mate to hold our hand through life? Why, do you wanna get married? I'll do it! What? What? No never mind.
 The movie's gonna work out fine.
 We're very close to securing her life rights.
 Close? I'm supposed to sing one of her songs friday night.
 Do we at least have the music rights? Yes and no.
 Yes, I'm talking.
 No, we do not have the music.
 But I'm on it.
 It's all gonna be fine.
 It's me.
 Look, I'm really busy right now.
 I just wanted to apologize for the other night.
 But I didn't get a chance to explain myself.
 I'm kind of baby crazy of late.
 Socially inept and baby crazy.
 I feel like I'm in a beer commercial.
 I get it.
 I'm a piece of work.
 But I really like you.
 And if you gave me another chance, maybe this could be something.
 At this point in my life, maybe just isn't good enough.
 OK, here's a thought.
 Did you see the Sex and the City movie? Once again, I am an adult man.
 OK, Miranda and Steve were having issues because Steve cheated So bored.
 The point is they decided to take a break and then meet up at the Brooklyn Bridge at such and such a time if they wanted to stay together.
 Maybe we could do the same thing.
 Brooklyn Bridge, Saturday, 2:00 p.
m.
 But for whatever reason, if I don't see you there, take care, Liz Lemon.
 You too.
 And can you transfer me to the Italian ambassador's office? Because I lika to maka prank phone call.
 Please hold.
 What are you doing here? I wanted to come by and thank you for all your help.
 I wasn't sure what you were serving, so I brought a '65 Moët and some pizza-blasted pringles.
 That was very thoughtful.
 I'm sorry if I was rude the other day.
 You were not being rude.
 You were just being stupid.
 Did you go to the doctor? I had a biopsy, and I'm waiting for the results.
 So I'm handling it.
 Good.
 I'm glad.
 Excellent.
 So here you go.
 Thank you.
 Would you like to stay? I don't want to impose.
 Come on.
 Thank you.
 OK.
 Thank you so much.
 All of these people are your family? Why are they smiling so much? Who's being ostracized? Everybody, this is my friend Jack.
 I need to ask your advice about Stuart.
 We decided to do this whole meet me at the Brooklyn Bridge if we still want to be together thing from the Sex and the City movie.
 They do that a lot in movies.
 An affair to remember, Sleepless in Seattle, and that remake of An affair to remember that I was in, A blaffair to rememblack.
 I just don't know what to do.
 Here's what you don't do.
 Be alone.
 We were never meant to be alone.
 Surround yourself with people and love and babies with pierced ears.
 What is wrong with you? I've had a crazy 48h.
 It started when I realized I'm probably dying.
 I have this thing on my testicle.
 My god! No, it's OK.
 Whatever happens, it's OK.
 I don't wanna die alone and now I don't have to because I'm in love with my mother's nurse.
 Now you have what me and Angie have, minus the hypertension.
 Slow down.
 Have you been to a doctor? Waiting for the results of a biopsy.
 We went to this picnic.
 Have you ever had a piragua? It's exactly like a snow cone except they call it a piragua.
 It's my doctor's office.
 You take it.
 No.
 I'll do it.
 Thank you.
 The test was positive.
 No, I mean positive like it's good! The test results were negative.
 I see your confusion.
 That is funny! Funny! Jack thought the test results was positive! Supersonic idiotic disconnected not respected Who would ever really want to go and top that, top that! Thank you.
 That was the rap song Top That from the movie Teen Witch.
 Once again, I apologize that our regular warm-up comic OD'ed at a gay man's apartment this morning.
 30 secs.
 I've decided to go at the bridge tomorrow.
 You've inspired me.
 What if this experience hasn't changed me? Maybe everything I was feeling for Elisa was just neediness and fear.
 I mean, can two people fall in love over a benign gonad cyst? Why not? It's not about where things start.
 It's about where it goes.
 Tracy told me that.
 He's kind of on a roll.
 Ladies and gentlemen, miss Janet Jopler! Who? Until we get the life rights, we have to protect ourselves.
 I'd like you to come on Come on Come on and take it Take another little chunk of my lung now, mister Also, we didn't get the songs.
 I wrote this myself 5 minutes ago.
 You know you bought it If life makes you sweet food Now this I like.
 Waiting for someone? What? What do you think you're doing? I'm so sorry! I thought he was someone else.
 Shut it down! Chunk of my lung, chunk of my lung! And take it! Take a big old chunk of my lung now baby Take it! Take a big old chunk of my lung Chunk of my lung You know you bought it If you buy it with things   

                




                    			Hey, guys! Four days till vacation week.
 Where are we all going? Nowhere.
 We don't get next week off.
 We gotta load out the sets, take em to storage.
 Then at night, I gotta drive around Newark, looking for my runaway daughter.
 What happened to your hand? I was trying out my spray tan for my trip to St.
 Bartleby's next week.
 How could you do that to your beautiful hands? With your flat, manly milking thumbs and your long, graceful knuckle hair Thank you, Kenneth.
 Are you sick? Cause I am not getting sick before my trip.
 The place I go to has private beaches, soft serve ice cream machines, and, after the french custom, people wear dark socks to the beach.
 It's the one thing I do for myself every year, and I am going.
 Look, I even bought a new swimsuit.
 What is that? It's called a tankoort, Cerie.
 You may have seen it in Us Weekly, being worn by dame Judi Dench's mother.
 Don't worry, I never get sick.
 I have the constitution of an ox.
 I must have ox fever! When did I walk barefoot near an ox? You have the flu.
 Go home! You are not ruining my vacation! Liz, wait.
 Did you get that swim thing for your vacation? You know it's canceled, right? What? What are you talking about? The hotel was overbooked.
 I texted you.
 No, you didn't.
 I forgot to hit send! Just hold on a second.
 There ya go.
 I got a great reservation to celebrate our first real date.
 Have you ever had sushi? I once had a very undercooked fish sandwich at a parade.
 I guess that counts.
 No, but I can only stay for five minutes.
 I have to go back to work.
 I thought today was your day off.
 I have another patient on my off days.
 He's a sweet old man with advanced dementia.
 Totally disconnected from reality.
 That reminds me.
 I owe Lou Dobbs a call.
 Elisa, are you telling me that you work 7 days a week? I have two jobs.
 That's what regular people do, you know? Especially those whose grandmothers are addicted to online poker.
 Don't let that keep us apart.
 When are you back with my mother? I'll cook you dinner.
 Your house is my workplace.
 Plus, Colleen doesn't seem to like that we're together.
 I hope you know she acts like that cause she hates every woman I like.
 It's not because you're a I'm sorry, what do you call yourself? A Puerto Rican.
 I know you can say that, but what do I call you? A Puerto Rican.
 That does not sound right.
 Episode 308: "Flu Shot" Mr.
 Donaghy wants to see you in the green room.
 Why are you still here? Don't worry about me.
 I'm a I should be going to the Caribbean.
 Instead, I'm stuck here with you and a bunch of guys named Sully.
 Miss Lemon? Sully! Brett Favre, right? I need to ask you to drop your pants.
 That's it.
 Have a sucker.
 There you are.
 Leo's giving out flu shots.
 Not my favorite part of the medical profession.
 My favorite part is attending executions.
 Can I ask you a question as a woman? You may! Are you going to alter your voice and dress up in any way? Liz.
 Sorry.
 I don't know what to do about Elisa.
 She works all the time.
 You know she's 2nd generation Puerto Rican.
 You can't call her that! That's what I thought.
 With work and everything, it's just turning out to be complicated.
 You said the same thing about C.
C.
 Count yourself lucky you're getting one of these.
 He only has 5 left.
 I need you to tell me who on your staff is important enough to get one.
 Hold on.
 You're rationing health care? That's not OK.
 Yes, Lemon.
 Important people get better health care.
 They also get better restaurant reservations, bigger seats in planes.
 A more refined class of prostitute.
 For me, it's really about the companionship.
 Like it or not, you're one of us now, one of the elite.
 I'm not.
 I am from White Haven, P.
A.
 My grandfather dug out the White Haven quarry, and my other grandfather filled it back in with the sludge from the eraser factory.
 I am still way more like those people than you.
 I don't want anything they don't get.
 You don't wanna get sick! It's not about that.
 It's about fairness.
 I don't want the shot.
 When is modern science gonna find a cure for a woman's mouth? What are you doing here? Making this work.
 I brought some dinner and Monopoly.
 We can have a fun, low-key night Unless I lose.
 That is sweet.
 But very inappropriate.
 Get in before somebody sees you.
 The agency would fire me if they knew I was having guests! Well Who's going to tell them? Him? Hey, it's me, Matlock.
 I need your help.
 OK, very funny! You work so hard.
 Don't you think you deserve some time for yourself? Of course I do.
 I've been living in New York for 15 years, and I've never seen a Broadway play or been in a restaurant that didn't have a TV in it or had a romantic dinner with a man in a suit.
 OK, you can stay.
 But it's not all gonna be fun and games.
 Mr.
 Templeton's foot is still healing.
 Of course You do your job, and I'll just What is wrong with it? Is that a beak? Tracy says Kauai is more beautiful than Maui and keeps shouting when I try to give my opinion, which is that Kauai is too rustic.
 Maui is the windsurfing capital of the world! Come on, we have to shoot these promos.
 My god, Jack gave you two flu shots? He said it was a flu shot.
 But I know it's really a truth serum.
 It's not.
 Then why am I telling you you look like Tootsie today? You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
 The crew is on death's door, and you're arguing about Hawaii? If I were you, I'd be doing something special to thank them.
 That would make us look pretty great.
 I'm considering giving you one of the remaining flu shots.
 No need, Sir.
 It would be an honor to die at my post and be given the traditional burial of a Parcell man Wrapped in a confederate flag, fried, and fed to dogs.
 Are you ready for your shot? Never.
 Two-tiered health care is a crime.
 You know, in Cuba, everybody gets equal health care.
 What a surprise you've seen the Michael Moore movie.
 Think again.
 I saw the trailer when I went to see Alvin and the Chipmunks.
 But this flu shot rationing is baloney.
 If my crew can't get a shot, I'm not getting a shot.
 You tell him! God bless you crewman.
 We gotta fight the power.
 Oh, boy Fight the powers that be! That's right! This makes me wanna shoop! Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop! Mr.
 Jordan, Miss Maroney, you wanted to see me? Tracy and I wanna do something for the crew.
 You know, to thank them for being sick.
 We didn't know what to get them.
 But then I had a brainstorm! It was a bad one.
 Jenna had to put my tongue guard in.
 But after he stabilized, we decided we'd get them all hot soup.
 So go do that.
 All the other pages have gone home sick.
 I can't make any runs right now.
 Maybe the two of you could go get the soup? I don't understand.
 Well, I'm saying you could get your wallet, My what? go downstairs to the basement.
 Then go to the soup place and bring the soup back up here.
 With what, my arms? Take your IDs with you.
 That'd be the worst part! Wait.
 Tracy, we have to do this.
 Without the crew, we'd just be 2 amazing people succeeding in a vacuum.
 Come on, do it for them.
 For the crew.
 Cause it's their birthday.
 I had a wonderful time last night.
 I did too.
 Are you with Mr.
 Templeton now? How I envy him.
 I wish you would exercise my muscles so they don't atrophy.
 Are you coming over tonight? We can finish our game of Monopoly.
 Of course I am.
 I'm just gonna be a little late.
 I have tickets to a special charity performance of The Lion King.
 I wish I could convince you to go with me.
 You know I can't.
 Are you kidding me? I'd love to go out, get all dressed up, tip maitre d's and be all like "thank you, Roger.
 This table was super-duper.
" I live in the big apple, but I spend all my time with the big vegetable.
 Why can't I have fun like an upper middle class person? Why can't you? You sound just like Lemon.
 Come with me tonight.
 Be a member of the elite.
 Nights like a banquet Give it a try Candlelight, caviar You and I and Templeton Mr.
 Templeton Why should he stay at home Just get his medication He'll go with us See a show with us Plan such a simple one Templeton, don't go away Just wanna let you know we appreciate what you said before.
 So in order to thank you, we got you a meat plate.
 Thanks, guys! I am really going to eat this.
 Enjoy.
 Cerie, what is this text you sent me supposed to mean? Your vacation is back on.
 Well, how is that any easier Wait, my vacation's back on? I guess since this flu, there's been a bunch of cancellations.
 I'm so happy the number 4, the letter u.
 Thank you, Banyani.
 Thank you, Oscar.
 God, they're all sick! You're all diseased! I can't get sick.
 I can't get sick! Stay away, sick Lutz! I have revision pages for you! My god, Pete! Thank god it's you! What's wrong? Why? Gimme the shot.
 I wanna go on my vacation.
 I take back all the stuff I said! If you want a shot you're going to have to dance for it.
 Very nice.
 I'm such a hypocrite.
 You have to promise me you won't tell anyone I'm getting this shot.
 I believe doctor/patient confidentiality is a two-way street.
 I'm cheating on my wife.
 Where have you been? We were supposed to shoot promos like an hour ago.
 We forgot about that.
 But we have a good reason.
 We were out getting soup for the crew.
 We forgot about that too.
 We were out shopping together.
 We had fun, though.
 Every girl crazy about a sharp I get it, you went shopping.
 I don't need the montage.
 I tried on a lotta outfits.
 And some of them, I was like no.
 But them some of them, I was like, yeah! So we're running behind cause you guys forgot to get soup.
 Is there anything you do that doesn't make my life harder? I can't believe we forgot the soup.
 We have to think of something else.
 I know.
 I also wanna thank you for controlling yourself sexually while we spent time together on this adventure.
 How you feeling? You got this bug yet? I'm a little achy.
 Probably 'cause I didn't get the shot.
 You should go home, sweetheart.
 You don't want this.
 No way, dude.
 If you're working, I'm working.
 That Liz Lemon's OK.
 Why do we hate her guts so much? We actually went on a date last night, Elisa and I, and it was magical.
 My purse! You took the old man with you? I admit it's an ethical gray area.
 No! It's just wrong.
 Yes, well, we all can't be as noble as you, turning down a flu shot on moral grounds, coming into work and risking your health despite your special vacation.
 It's called principles.
 I think I'm probably getting it.
 That reminds me.
 About 24 hours after receiving the flu shot, you develop a distinctive rash at the injection site.
 So please let makeup know for Tracy and Jenna.
 I wasn't resting.
 A Parcell man never lies down on the job.
 Unless that job involves milking pig teats.
 Miss Lemon, what is that? Did you Did you get the shot? This is a dream.
 You're having a fever dream.
 We're speaking french, and I'm your mother.
 Ma chère maman, pourquoi ? Pourquoi m'as tu laissé ? What are we doing tonight? It's a surprise.
 But he's gonna need a helmet.
 Come here.
 It's Mr.
 Templeton's son! You said he didn't have family! Not here! He lives in London.
 But now God has sent him to punish me for being so bad.
 Or maybe it's a business trip.
 You need to hide.
 I cannot lose this job.
 I'd have to go back to work in the late shift at Dunkin' Donuts.
 The customers are so sad.
 Can I help you? What time do you start throwing out donuts? He's coming in! There ya are.
 Of course.
 I'm here.
 Always.
 Sorry to surprise you.
 I just wanted to check on dad.
 How's he doing? Well he's stable but vegetative.
 Totally unaware of his surroundings.
 A man comes at night.
 He comes to the house and takes me.
 Dad! OK, that's surprising.
 He wears a suit.
 His hair is thick, like a Bolshevik commissar.
 He made me watch a giraffe with the legs of a man! Dad, it's me, Michael.
 He gave money to a silver man.
 He ate a plate of fire! Dad there's no man.
 Yes! He was in prison.
 But now he owns a railroad.
 What is going on? Why is he all worked up? You know, sometimes they watch cartoons, and they think it's real.
 It's very common.
 Tracy, I got it! Give it to me! It's mine! I know what we can get the crew.
 They don't need soup.
 They need medicine, and what's the best medicine? Medicine? Laughter.
 Do you see where I'm going with this? Well, he's finally asleep.
 You must be exhausted.
 Why don't you go to bed? No, thanks.
 I'm not tired.
 Good.
 Because there is something in the other room that I need to show you, and I won't remember what it is until I see it.
 The dark man is here! He's come to take me! Sir, no! I did things during the war Terrible things.
 Mr.
 Templeton, my name is Jack, and I'm just a guy dating your nurse, and I took advantage of your condition so I could be with her.
 Do you understand what I'm saying? What we did was wrong, but we did it for the greatest reason of all.
 You see, I've lost too many good things because I couldn't make time for them, and I can't let that happen with Elisa.
 Is Elisa the Puerto Rican? That really doesn't sound OK, but yes, and I beg you please don't tell your son.
 All right.
 But the next time we go out, I wanna go to Washington Square Park.
 It's where I proposed to my wife.
 And then I wanna go to a negro bar.
 I'll see what I can do.
 Attention, ladies and germs and gentlemen! Are you ready to feel better? Cause we have just the thing! Soup? Now, in the grand tradition of Patch Adams, prepare yourself for the comic stylings of Tracy the amazing and Jenna! Really? Do you really think this is helping? Leave her alone! What? Why aren't you laughing? This is happening to Liz! No they love Liz now.
 Everybody likes me.
 It's you two idiots What's that on your arm? She got a flu shot! She lied to us! Give us back our meat plate! No, guys, listen! You don't understand! This vacation You sold us out for a vacation? Not just any vacation.
 This one has beach socks and ice cream and sandwich turtles.
 I work so hard, guys.
 Don't I deserve to sit on a beach? Je vous déteste ! It's not what you think.
 There is a gentleman involved.
 A Filipino gentleman.
 His name is Banyani.
 I want to take him as my island lover.
 Last year, he was sending signals, and this time, I was gonna go for it.
 There.
 I said it! Are you happy? It kinda Peters out after that.
 I just suck pie off my sweatshirt for the next half hour.
 I'm so embarrassed.
 Well, that goes without saying.
 But good news is, your relationship with the crew is back where it should be, and now you can go on your vacation, guilt-free.
 No, I can't.
 I feel like a jerk.
 Come on.
 Embrace your elitism.
 What do we elites do when we screw up? Pretend it never happened and give ourselves a giant bonus.
 That you don't deserve.
 I don't deserve to go anywhere.
 Says who? What Elisa and I did wasn't right, but we're happier now.
 And you're going to be happier when you go to St.
 Bartleby's and get whatever's left of your groove back.
 Face it, Lemon, not everyone gets a shot.
 Not everyone gets to go to the Caribbean.
 But you're special.
 You're better.
 So go.
 Go to your island lover.
 All right, yes.
 I'm gonna.
 Did that come out of you or me? I don't know.
 It's really hot in here.
 You know, the flu vaccine is actually a small dose of the virus itself.
 So there's always the risk that Both ends.
 Both ends! I'm not gonna make it!   

                




                    			Which of these pictures do you like better? The one on the left? So the wacky one.
 Sure.
 What's the picture for? I'm giving the keynote address at the company's Six Sigma retreat to move forward in Croton-on-Hudson.
 Is that like a corporate retreat? I used to have to perform at those all the time back when Jenna and I were in that improv troupe.
 The audience suggestion is Sling Blade and Oprah on a date.
 I sure do like them french fried pataters.
 No, you don't, Oprah.
 Jenna is not a great improviser.
 To be honest I'm a little apprehensive about going to this thing.
 I haven't seen a lot of these people since the CEO debacle and my time in the Bush administration.
 You never really told me what happened in Washington.
 Please be gentle.
 The point is a lot has happened to me since the retreat last year.
 So I hope that when I return, they still think of me as the same guy.
 You've got camp jitters.
 What? You haven't seen your little business camp friends in a year, and now you're afraid they gonna think you got weird.
 The retreat to move forward is a global meeting of G.
E.
's best and brightest.
 Careers are made there.
 It would be helpful to have someone with me who's got my back.
 Don't make me be your camp friend.
 I hate those corporate things.
 Bunch of drunk people talking about synergy.
 First of all, never badmouth synergy.
 And I'm asking you to do this as a favor.
 Fine! I'll go.
 For you.
 As long as this place has a spa They do.
 Where you're allowed to eat in the sauna.
 Cause at some places, they get mad.
 Writers, we need to gather for an actor announcement.
 As you probably know, I have been cast in an upcoming feature film.
 Is it a movie where you swap brains with your granddaughter? I will be playing Janis Joplin.
 Or depending on how some legal matters pan out, a Janis Joplin-type character named Janet Jopler or Janie Jimplin.
 Why are you telling us this? Cause I will be employing the "method" method of acting.
 So for the next few weeks, I will only respond to "Janis" or "Miss Joplin.
" If you're nasty.
 If anyone has anything to say to me, Jenna, now would be your last chance.
 Your hands are weird.
 I don't think you went to high school.
 I'm not busy Friday, just said I was.
 OK.
 I am Janis now.
 You are all saying those things to Janis Joplin.
 The veil is drawn.
 You should do your Janis research on Wikipedia.
 It's online, so anyone can update it.
 You know, cause people are finding out new things about Janis Joplin every day.
 Really? Thank you, Frank.
 Wikipedia.
 I'm gonna check that out.
 OK, I'm on Wikipedia.
 Edit page.
 Did you know that Janis Joplin speed walked everywhere and was afraid of toilets? I have heard that.
 Yes.
 Was she really? So how am I looking, Dr.
 Spaceman? Well, Tracy, I don't know how to say this.
 Dee-ay-buh-tees.
 Diabetes? That's it.
 Now we know what we're dealing with.
 Unless you make some serious lifestyle changes, you're in danger of becoming diabetic.
 So how bad is diabetes, really? It's quite serious.
 If left untreated, you could lose a foot.
 Could I replace it with a wheel, like Rosie from the Jetsons? I suppose.
 But then you'd have to register as a motor vehicle.
 Buddy, here we go.
 Bases loaded.
 Bottom of the ninth.
 Are you gonna step up? Because it's winning time, you magnificent son of a bitch! You go in there and show them.
 Make mommy proud of her big boy because he's the best.
 Just do it.
 Is it in you? I'm loving it! Are you OK? I'm sorry, I was just Were you psyching yourself up in the mirror? I do that before I go to a party where I don't know a lot of people.
 Stop sweating, you idiot.
 What is wrong with you, you stupid bitch! I wish you hadn't seen that.
 It's OK.
 You're ready to get in there, psyched up.
 You got your camp buddy.
 Just do it.
 You are a lion.
 Take what's yours.
 There they are, the Six Sigmas themselves.
 They're dudes? Each of them embodies a pillar of the Six Sigma business philosophy.
 Teamwork.
 Insight.
 Brutality.
 Male enhancement.
 Handshakefulness.
 And play hard.
 Wish me luck.
 Men, if I'd known your wives were alone, I would've stayed in New York.
 Jack Donaghy.
 We've been waiting all day for you to show up.
 This is my friend Guys over in war machines have been dying to see you.
 The finulus data suggest we should be leveraging disintermediation paradigms.
 Obviously, the finular analysis will concur with any synergized mindshare classifications.
 Bladorian Frankles.
 Hi.
 I'm Liz.
 I'm Prashant.
 This is Joan.
 We're M7s.
 What level are you? No, I'm just here with my friend.
 Or I was.
 So you're like a G or an H? No, I'm not part of this.
 I'm not any letter.
 J? Morning, Mr.
 Jordan.
 What's that on your foot? It's a practice wheel for when I lose my foot to diabetes.
 You can't eat candy if you have diabetes.
 There's no link between diabetes and diet.
 That's a white myth, Ken.
 Like Larry Bird or Colorado.
 It's not a myth.
 Gentlemen, back me up here.
 I don't know.
 My dad had diabetes, and he ate whatever he wanted until he died on the day I was born.
 How do you not see the connection? You know, there's a conspiracy theory that after the Civil War, the U.
S.
 Government spread false information about diabetes To keep the newly-freed slaves sluggish and docile.
 Heard that from Yusef Jackson.
 Which is why, most African Americans don't understand that diabetes is caused by sleeping on your back.
 I don't think that's right.
 Diabetes and diet.
 Next you'll be telling me that leasing a sports car is a bad investment! Nice suit, Squaresville.
 Where's the bank? What can I do for you miss Jimplin? Well, according to my Wikipedia page, I'm gonna need some cherry juice, buttermilk, and tequila to make my signature Janis Joplin cocktail, the Frankschlong.
 Good grief.
 Where you been hiding? There you are.
 Sorry I got distracted.
 Seems like you don't need your camp buddy.
 I know.
 It's going great.
 I'm joining the Six Sigmas for lunch.
 I like lunch.
 Right.
 Yes.
 Well join us.
 What is this? It's l.
u.
n.
c.
h.
 Lego Utilization for Negating Crisis Hierarchies.
 It's a competitive teambuilding exercise where one person directs his teammates in the construction of a Lego model that only he can see.
 Why don't you join team Donaghy? We'll win, and then go to c.
l.
a.
s.
s.
 I don't want to go to class.
 No, c.
l.
a.
s.
s.
, acronym for "consuming lunch and simple socializing.
" Now that just seems intentionally confusing.
 What's up with this disgusting stuff? I've seen too many folks back home die of diabetes and go-kart accidents to sit idly by while you ruin your health.
 You need to eat better.
 N-o-e.
 No.
 E.
 OK, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Whatever you like.
 I just hope don't you get eaten by the hill witch.
 What's that? I didn't say anything.
 You want to hear tell of the hill witch? My meemaw saw her once taking away a boy who wouldn't eat his vegetables.
 She's a shriveled crone, One look turns you to stone, and then she gorges on your living brain.
 Through the stone? Really, Ken? That was your plan.
 Doubt me if you dare.
 But beware the omens of her coming.
 Crops will fail.
 Animals will run wild.
 And my page desk will be turned sideways.
 Frank, you have got to check out Maroney.
 Your Wikipedia prank is inspired.
 OK, Janis did it.
 You can do it.
 I'm gonna do it.
 I'm gonna eat this cat.
 Janis, don't! That's from Alf.
 Alf ate cats.
 What? I put all that stuff on Wikipedia.
 None of it's true.
 Why would you do that? I'm sorry.
 I didn't know you were gonna take it so seriously.
 Of course I'm taking it seriously.
 This is my chance to win an Oscar.
 The Academy loves dead singers and the handicapped, and Janis was both.
 No, she wasn't.
 Her legs bent the right way.
 I speed walked home on these.
 You pathetic load! You mess with me because your life is miserable.
 Because you're disgusting! What? Nothing, just You're yelling at me.
 You're a mess.
 You're Joplined out on tequila.
 It's kinda working for me.
 Are you turned on right now? What is wrong with you? I've got a thing for damaged goods.
 But if you can get this raw in the movie, you are gonna win the Oscar! Really? Two minutes.
 Don't stop talking, Jack.
 Always be talking! Hands in pockets, Joan.
 Prashant, your job is to watch Joan.
 Say something, haircut.
 No more wheels on one side than the other.
 Uh-doyee! It goes on top.
 It's a smokestack.
 Suck it, nerds! What happened to you? What do you mean? That woman is a subordinate of yours.
 Her behavior is totally inappropriate.
 Familiarity.
 Nicknamification.
 And you seem to encourage it.
 Lemon is unique.
 But the old Jack Donaghy wouldn't have stood for that.
 Sorry! I dropped it when I was pretending it was my penis! Robot penis.
 We won! About last night Oh, God.
 I just want to make sure you haven't told anyone what happened.
 I've a lot of irons in the fire around here.
 You'll keep it to yourself, right? Yes.
 Of course.
 Thank you.
 Wait.
 I'm sorry.
 You don't want people to know about us? Oh, God, no.
 I mean, it's so embarrassing.
 For me.
 You should want to brag about it.
 Don't worry about that.
 Last night was stupid.
 Stupid, Frank! Last night was the best thing that's ever happened to you.
 It was my mistake, not yours.
 I'm the one who had to take the Silkwood shower this morning.
 Fine.
 Whatever.
 But you'll be cool about this? You The one who cool should be.
 All right.
 Cool.
 What the hell was that? First of all, there's an omelet bar downstairs.
 So you should probably go get yourself an omelet.
 Second, I want to see if your room is bigger than mine.
 You have a sitting area? You jag! Please come in.
 I give you a certain amount of leeway at work.
 But while we're here, I need you to behave appropriately.
 What are you talking about? The nicknames, the arm punching, the familiarity.
 The way you were behaving at l.
u.
n.
c.
h.
 You can't say "uh-doyee" to me in mixed company.
 So when I helped you win that Lego thing When I thought we were having fun together, I was actually embarrassing you, is that right? While we're here, I need you to call me Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I get it.
 You brought me here in case you needed me.
 But now, you have your cool 6 Sigma friends, I can go back to the lake with the fat kids and make bracelets.
 You know how important this is to me.
 I've got my speech tonight.
 Don't worry.
 I get boundaries.
 Sorry, Liz, my parent's basement only has room for 5 sleeping bags.
 Or, no, I'll come over after prom and we'll make nachos together.
 This is part of our problem.
 I give you a simple managerial suggestion in a professional context, and I get back the 2nd half of a Judy Blume novel.
 Whatever.
 This place is dumb.
 We'll be back at work tomorrow.
 Let's not make this bigger than it is.
 Too late.
 Friendship over.
 Good Lord Like a waitress.
 Mr.
 Jordan, I am begging you, as a friend, to eat better.
 I just don't want to see anything bad happen to you.
 I'm fine, Ken.
 I have so much energy, my hand keeps dancin'.
 I just don't know what has to happen for you to start The signs! My desk is sideways! The hill witch approaches.
 Dudes, the craziest thing happened to me last night.
 You're not gonna believe it.
 But I found the secret skate park in GTA 4! Nice.
 Are you seriously talking about video games? Jenna.
 What's up? How dare you? How dare you be cool about this.
 Frank and I hooked up last night, OK? Stop acting like you're ashamed.
 I'm the one who's ashamed.
 It's disgusting, right? I slutted it up on this dirtbag.
 It is disgusting.
 Thank you, Lutz.
 Jenna, this is a mistake.
 No.
 Last night was a mistake.
 This is a victory for hot women everywhere.
 So what are we doing after this? Prashant and I have plans.
 Did you guys hook up? What happens in Croton-on-Hudson stays in Croton-on-Hudson.
 I do still have a seat at my table up front.
 No, thank you, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I'm happier here.
 Prashant, that is my foot.
 My wrongness.
 Excuse me, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I need to put a microphone on you for your speech.
 I can't believe you don't want to sit with Jack Donaghy.
 He's not that great.
 You guys are my friends.
 We should start calling ourselves the three musketeers.
 Not.
 Good one, Prashant.
 So I heard about you and Frank.
 I know.
 It's hard to believe.
 Now Dog the bounty hunter's the second grossest guy I've been with.
 You shouldn't have done that.
 Tell me about it.
 Because he's mine! Wait, what are you doing? Why is my scalp burning more than usual? I told you not to tell anyone! What are you doing to my hair! You stay away from my Frank! Who is with my Frank? Katie.
 Euzebia.
 Please, let me explain.
 What is this? Eat your vegetables.
 Damn, K, that is weak! I'm a 40-year-old man! You think I'm gonna be scared into eating some stuff because of some Look at me! I'm a monster! Hill witch, I renounce everything! Cover your brain! Come on, guys.
 OK, your microphone is all set.
 I'll come back right before your speech to turn it on.
 And thanks for being so cool with me.
 This is my first day.
 No problem.
 Well, buddy, here we go.
 Bottom of the ninth.
 Bases loaded.
 It's winning time, you magnificent son of a bitch! What is that? His psych-up speech.
 He doesn't know his microphone is on.
 We gotta tell him.
 Why would we? When a big one falls, You go in there and show those turds who's boss.
 Make mommy proud of her big boy because he's the best! Just do it.
 Is it in you? I'm loving it! Don't say your name, Jack.
 Please don't say your name.
 You are Jack Donaghy.
 Titan.
 Maverick.
 Lover.
 Excuse me.
 Where is the bathroom? Your mike is on in the ballroom.
 What? How much did they hear? Everything.
 God, I'm ruined.
 I'm never gonna leave this town.
 They're gonna talk about this forever.
 No.
 I'll help you.
 It's gonna be OK.
 I got nothing.
 What's up, 6 Sigma? It's Liz Lemon from the entertainment division.
 I just fooled y'all with my Jack Donaghy impression, where I say crazy things that he would never say.
 So let's maximize our fun quadrant tonight.
 Shout out any other impression you want to hear and I'll do it.
 I dare ya.
 Do Jack Donaghy again! No.
 What else? How about Cher? Do Cher! Al Pacino! I believe I heard Sling Blade! I love them french fried pataters.
 Get off! What's that? Mrs.
 Cunningham from Happy Days? Oh, Howard.
 Oh, Arthur.
 What's your name, guy? And what's the craziest thing that's happened to you this weekend? Hearing Jack Donaghy talk on that microphone.
 Well, not anymore, cause check this out! Everybody dance now Lemon, that was heroic.
 And I think it actually worked.
 Lot of people from conference emailed me to ask if I was there when the bra lady went crazy.
 They completely forgot about me, so thank you.
 Sure.
 And it goes without saying that you're banned from any future retreats.
 I can't believe you did that for me.
 That's what friends do.
 Uh-doyee!   

                




                    			Here's the research you wanted for that white house skit.
 OK, thanks.
 You know it, Lady Broseph! Those are your new interns.
 Aren't they a little old, and over-dressed? They're former investment bankers who were laid off after that economic crash that Nancy Pelosi caused.
 They've got zero real-world skills, but god, they work hard.
 Gentlemen, I need you to run out and pick up some flowers, a collection of bath soaps, and some spanish-language gossip magazines.
 Soap and spanish magazines? What, are you expecting a visit from the Don't start unless you've got something.
 Elisa's grandmother's coming to visit.
 I don't think she likes me.
 I don't understand it.
 As long as Elisa likes you, that's all that matters, right? I need Concepción on board.
 She's the matriarch of this family.
 And in Puerto Rico, elderly women are held in very high esteem.
 You should go there.
 They'd love you.
 None of this is mine.
 I live in 3-B, this is 13-B.
 You know what, I'm gonna say it.
 Women should not deliver the mail.
 Dr.
 Andrew Baird? Do you know this guy? I don't think so.
 He's a pediatrician, so you know he likes kids.
 Or feet.
 No, kids.
 He has a bill from a divorce lawyer, so you know he's single.
 And he has a golf magazine, so you know he's not gay or poor.
 Come on.
 Let's see what kind of movies he likes.
 That's a federal offense! And you already have 2 strikes.
 I do not support this! Muppets Take Manhattan.
 Caddyshack.
 And a documentary about how pies are made.
 Hello, Dr.
 Baird.
 Wasn't that a treat? Only the special tours get to see Conan without his wig.
 I'm sorry, but her show's on now.
 Do you think we could Jonathan, would you come and help Mrs.
 Padriera? I think your grandmother hates me.
 I don't understand.
 She's usually a very loving person.
 Is it because I'm white? I've had white boyfriends.
 Black, Cuban Brazilian guys with German heritage I get it.
 You've been with other men.
 Congratulations.
 Thank you.
 What is she watching? Los Amantes Clandestinos.
 A mexican telenovela.
 But who is that? That is El Generalissimo.
 He's the villain of Los Amantes.
 The name of the actor is Hector Moreda.
 He looks exactly like me.
 He does look like you.
 Episode 310: "El Generalissimo" Dude, I have to meet you.
 I'm Brian.
 What's up, Brian? We love you.
 "This honky grandma be trippin'.
" When I quote lines from your movie, that's not racist? Of course not.
 I transcend race.
 We're all going out after work, and I know you like to party.
 We'd be honored if you come with.
 You shouldn't end a sentence with a preposition at.
 But yeah, I'm in.
 We'll start off at McManus-McMinnigan's.
 Have you ever drunk a yard of beer? A yard, like a lawn? Yes, I have.
 He has an ice cream maker? Come on! Don't be weird-looking.
 Ah, girl! Dr.
 Baird, there's someone at your door.
 Thanks, Oswald.
 He was just helping me hang some pictures.
 I live in the basement, so I have all the nails.
 I'm Drew.
 Sorry, I smell like frosting.
 I just love to bake.
 I want to go to there.
 So will I see you before Saturday? About this weekend I don't think you should come to my cousin's police academy graduation, or my other cousin's parole party.
 Boy, I hope those two don't eventually have a showdown that pits family against justice.
 Hang on, you mean you don't want me to come? It's not me.
 Abuela thought it should just be family.
 Is this about the Generalissimo? As a child, my grandmother worked in a silver mine without proper ventilation.
 Now, her mind is squishy like a hacky sack.
 But no matter what, she's still my abuelita.
 Even though sometimes she comes at me with a knife because of a silver frenzy.
 I'll call you tomorrow, OK? Good night, querida.
 Generalissimo.
 Look at Dr.
 Baird.
 How did you get a picture of him? Told him his haircut was exactly what I've been trying to describe to my barber.
 Smooth, I know.
 I'm way out of my league here.
 Don't get intimidated.
 You know he can't be perfect.
 He might be.
 I got some more of his mail.
 And I opened it.
 I'm the worst.
 It just proves that I don't deserve this guy.
 He went to medical school at Columbia, all kinds of charity baloney.
 He gets all of the movie channels, including Starz.
 And he trains seeing eye dogs at home.
 That's no good for you.
 You're allergic to dogs.
 Guess I'll have to step in then.
 Shut up.
 Let me think! Please keep your voices down.
 Mr.
 Jordan is a little hung over.
 He pulled an uncle Harland Parcell last night.
 Minus the wistful jug blowing.
 I went out with the interns.
 Those white boys are not kidding around.
 Have you ever tasted Scotch? It's terrible! And this thing they call "box seats at the Rangers game," it's so cold! And what is Rohypnol? Those are roofies! So I shouldn't have taken two of them for my headache? There he is! Tonight, shooters at Blockheads, lay a base, meet up with my bro-hams at Cornell club? You know it, bri-man! A'ight! I have no idea what either one of us just said.
 He thinks you're going out again.
 You gotta tell him you can't.
 I have a rep to maintain.
 If I can't keep up with a bunch of Wall Street frat boys Here come the roofies.
 You can do whatever you want to me.
 You wanted to see me? This is Elisa.
 What? Come on, you're a nurse? Some of us are hot.
 We have a problem with him.
 Boy, that guy looks a lot like you! Precisely.
 Hector Moreda and the Generalissimo are poisoning Elisa's grandmother against me.
 He just blew up that kid! Elisa and I have enough obstacles.
 Our work schedules, our cultures, her adorably broken english.
 Metrocards are a real thing.
 You use them on the subway.
 Anyway, this morning, Telemundo, which is owned by Sheinhardt-Universal, purchased Los Amantes Clandestinos.
 And now I own it.
 Isn't that romantic? Now, all I have to do is kill off the Generalissimo, and clear a path to Elisa's abuela.
 The director needs a script this afternoon, and she'll help you with the spanish.
 Don't drag me into this.
 I have my own problems.
 And I've never even watched that show.
 All you need to know is that El Generalissimo is pure evil, look at him.
 He stole that girl's love letters and opened them.
 Opened her mail? That is just shocking.
 He's a monster.
 Or he has a really good reason to do it.
 No, his only reason was to trick her into giving up her honor to him.
 And how did he use her mail to do that, exactly? He read her most intimate secrets, and turned himself into that which she desired.
 What she loved, he pretended to love too, until it was too late.
 My dog ran away! Let me get my coat.
 Buster.
 If see the dog, give us a shout.
 Come here, boy! The funny thing is this is what I love about him.
 Don'worry, Liz.
 We're gonna find him.
 If we don't, I don't think I could ever be around dogs again.
 I'm actually on the board of the Pediatric Restless Leg Syndrome Association.
 I forgot I even had this on.
 I have so many charity t-shirts.
 We have so much in common.
 Buster's probably dead.
 Wanna go to the wine bar around the corner, deal with these emotions, get some dinner? I would love to, I really would.
 But, I just got divorced not that long ago.
 I'm really not ready for this kind of thing just yet.
 Plus, I have not given up on that dog.
 He's a fighter.
 Shoot it, dog! I'm going to! I'm Tracy Jordan.
 Why would I be afraid of fire next to my mouth? Is she watching? Yes.
 I told her it was a very special episode.
 Good-bye, general.
 Wait, wait.
 What did he just say? That wasn't in the script.
 He said "you missed.
" He said "you missed again.
" "And now, this potion's gonna make me live forever.
" What's happening? El Generalissimo was supposed to die! Morena has gone broken arrow.
 We really should have had somebody on the set who speaks Spanish.
 I'll call you back.
 Moreda Welcome, Jack.
 Cigar, brandy? What happened, Hector? The general was supposed to die.
 Do not try to out-generalissimo me, my friend.
 This role has made me rich, famous and respected.
 I get to cut the line at Disneyland, if I come mid-week.
 I have a lucrative endorsement deal with Sabor de Soledad! I'm not going to let you take all that away from me.
 I know where you came from.
 Play ball, or you'll be back doing R-rated hypnotism at bull fights so fast, you won't know what hit you.
 You come over here and say that to my face.
 Come over here.
 If you refuse to be reasonable, I must call the presidente of Telemundo.
 La oficina de Jack Donaghy.
 Well-played.
 I see that we are not so different, you and I.
 We laugh alike.
 We think alike.
 At times, we even drink alike.
 You can lose your mind! You should know, I'm doing this for a woman.
 This woman.
 I am super gay, and I would totally switch for her.
 She's amazing.
 But her grandmother hates me, because she hates the Generalissimo, so he's gotta go.
 El Generalissimo does not have to die to clear the way to the abuela.
 Not if the abuela comes to love him.
 But that's impossible.
 Seduction is never impossible for El Generalissimo.
 I will become everything that old hispanic women desire.
 I will make her love me.
 You really think you can pull that off? It will be the performance of a lifetime.
 Like Julie Harris in The Belle of Amherst.
 You are surprisingly gay.
 OK, so? So did you ever find Buster? What did you not understand? That picture is from a dog food ad.
 Hi, Lemon.
 Here's today's script.
 I translated it, and took out the Star Wars references.
 Are you an actress? I'm a nurse.
 Good.
 Don't listen to anyone who says you should become an actress.
 I also cut the scene between the general and tia Maria.
 They cannot be together.
 Not after what he did to Maria's daughter.
 Why? What did he do? It was despicable.
 Even worse than his misuse of the mails.
 The Generalissimo tricked her to the villa by inviting her to a fancy party.
 But when she got there, it was just the two of them.
 He drugged her champagne and had his way with her.
 Later, she gave birth to the devil.
 You know, sweeps week.
 That's what I could do to Drew.
 Drug him? Having been on both sides of that, I could tell you it's not a good idea.
 I'm going to tell Drew that I'm having a little "welcome to the building" party for him, but there is no party.
 And then, when he shows up, I'll laugh and say "it's the wrong night.
" And then he'll laugh, and say "one glass couldn't hurt.
" And then I'll put my mouth on his mouth.
 Do not do this.
 The trickery, the deceit is a slippery slope.
 But you haven't seen Dr.
 Baird.
 He looks like a cartoon pilot.
 Be very careful.
 El Generalissimo was once a good man.
 But the years of loneliness drove him insane.
 I am not the Generalissimo.
 I called my uncle Harland, and I got his hangover cure.
 "Mix two cups boiled possum meat "with one messload ragweed, stir in alcohol " These interns are wearing me out.
 It's like I said in my not-hit comedy Cruise Boat, "I'm getting too old for this ship.
" You are getting older, sir.
 There's no reason you have to keep acting like you're 20.
 Yes, there is.
 Do you know what happens to a comedian when he gets old and loses his audience? He starts to get offered serious roles.
 And do you really want to see me play Arthur Ashe? That would be terrible.
 You leave him alone! Exactly.
 So if I'm gonna keep my hilarious reputation, these interns gotta go! But where? They don't know how to do anything, and there's no jobs left on Wall Street.
 Then I'll find something for them to do.
 Am I the first one here? What? The party's tomorrow night.
 Tonight, I'm just hanging out, eating fondue by candlelight.
 But come in, I was just opening a bottle of wine to drink alone.
 I guess one glass couldn't hurt.
 I found your dog! What? He lost his collar, but I recognize him from the poster.
 That's not possible! Of course it's possible.
 How could he not want to come back to this beautiful lady? My dog is back! I'll open the wine.
 Just put him down.
 You need more.
 Buster, you wang! Let's get you back in your special kitchen cabinet.
 Man, that dog is giving me a headache.
 I have some aspirin in my white bag there if you need any.
 Everything OK in there? He's just playing along.
 Or he bites me.
 Alone at last.
 Are you OK? You've been roofied! You did what? Not me.
 The pills! Is this my mail? You're not thinking clearly.
 Why is it all open? That's not your dog.
 I can explain.
 Just relax.
 I am the Generalissimo! I don't know what that means.
 Abuela made you breaded calf's brains.
 She really liked the changes you made in Los Amantes Clandestinos.
 She's very proud that I am dating such an important television man.
 What are you going to do about the NBC news? It's too sad.
 I'll look into it abuela.
 Again, I'm so sorry about everything I actually got some of your mail.
 Hope you didn't open it.
 I did.
 Monthy Python, Live at the Hollywood Bowl.
 Classic.
 Membership in the Cheese of the Month Club, and the Steak of the Month Club, and a copy of Vegetarian Times.
 I'm a flip-flopper.
 Also a response to your complaint about bad grammar in subway ads.
 The word "whom" deserves a defender.
 I'm just saying that based on your mail, I actually would have wanted to meet this Elizabeth Lemon in 3-B.
 Really? Do you wanna try this again? I know that I lied to you, and I accidentally roofied you, but weirder things have happened, right? Isn't that Tracy Jordan? The Lehman Brothers investment bank will reopen under the direction of comedian Tracy Jordan.
 I'm doing this so no one will know I'm getting old.
 But you just told us you're old.
 This interview is over.
 I guess weirder things have happened.
 And now to lighten things up, some pictures of beautiful latin babies, and the music of Tito Puente.
 Jack this is ridiculous.
 It's a date.
   

                




                    			Morning, Dr.
 Baird.
 Morning, regular person Lemon.
 Are you around this weekend? Maybe we could have that date talked How about Friday? No, Friday I have a stupid show.
 How about Saturday? Saturday I guess that doesn't have to be weird.
 OK then.
 Valentine's day it is.
 Saturday is Valentine's day? Norts! You sound so sexy when you say that.
 Say it again.
 Your mother's gone back to Florida.
 These McFlurries are amazing.
 I know.
 The soft swirl of vanilla, and the hard crunch of candy and cookies.
 You'd think they fight each other, but no, together they are perfecto.
 Some would say that describes us.
 Who would say such a crazy thing? We are us.
 Let a McFlurry be what it is The world's greatest dessert.
 Actually, the world's greatest dessert is served in a restaurant right here in New York called Plunder.
 It costs $1,000.
 Lucky for you, your boyfriend got reservations for Valentine's day.
 But I have to go to church.
 On Valentine's day? Is that a thing? It is the feast of the martyrdom of St.
 Valentine.
 Please, don't tell me you're one of those convenient catholics that only goes to church every Sunday.
 Episode 311: "St Valentine's Day" Kenneth, you know how the company makes an effort to hire the disabled? Do I! I wouldn't have this job if it weren't for the mouth on my back.
 I'm supposed to supervise some blind chick hired to edit the reruns.
 But 3 of the dancers just found out they're all dating the same guy, so I'm gonna go watch that.
 So if you see a blind chick, I don't know.
 Give her one of your boring tours.
 Yes, sir.
 Yes, sir.
 I was just funning.
 It's all sewed up.
 I'll help you, miss.
 Thank you so much.
 All my friends warned me about the big city, but look, right away I meet a gentleman.
 Is everything OK? Cause now I smell burnt plastic.
 Are you there? I can't make this guy go on a first date on Valentine's.
 Why are you so nervous about this? Because it's a delicate situation.
 There is handsomeness involved.
 How much? Come on, what is this, a green card thing? Closet case, slump buster? No, not a ballplayer.
 Bundy-esque serial killer? That was my first thought, but no.
 This is actually happening, and I'm blowing it.
 Who pushes for a first date on Valentine's day? Here's how you correct this misstep.
 Instead of going to a restaurant, where it'll be nothing but people in love and rings hidden in pastries Cook him a nice meal at home.
 Nice you mean, like, stew? I certainly do not mean stew.
 I mean, try to forget Valentine's day.
 I'm going to.
 I'll be in church.
 What? Why? Elisa is deeply religious.
 If I had those knockers, I'd thanks god too.
 All I want for Valentine's day is to go to Plunder and eat the lovers delight.
 That sounds filthy.
 It is.
 Imagine a dessert for two Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream in a pool of Cognac, drizzled in the world's most expensive chocolate, amadei porcelana, covered with shaved white, black, and clear truffles, and topped with edible 25-karat gold leaf.
 Can you imagine anything better? I don't know, you ever put a doughnut in the microwave? Come on, church won't be so bad.
 Aren't you Catholic? I was Catholic.
 But I haven't set foot inside a church since I was 13 years old.
 So you go sit through a night of church, and then you go to Plunder.
 Elisa's worth it.
 You're right.
 She's worth it.
 And I can fake enthusiasm when I need to.
 That scarf is fun! Thanks.
 I found it at Dunkin Wait a minute.
 NBC.
 Thank you.
 Ken, you need to snap out of it and ask out that sexy Miss Magoo.
 I have no idea what you're talking about.
 I know love at first sight when I see it.
 I saw it when I met Angie, I saw it the first time Dotcom laid eyes on Grizz's fiancee.
 There is something about Jennifer that just makes me all car sick inside.
 Now is the time for gallantry.
 It's you again.
 I can tell.
 Well, cotton and fiddles! I enjoy your smile.
 Oh, my I'm Jennifer Rogers.
 You may call me Kenneth the page.
 Because that is who I am.
 Would you like to go out with me tomorrow night, yes-indeedy corncobs? I'm gonna say yes.
 Because this just feels right, and, my instincts have never let me down.
 Except for looking at that eclipse.
 It's a Valentine's datelie-doo! That was really good stew.
 Thank you.
 It's my own recipe, I use cheddar cheese instead of water.
 You know, I'm glad we stayed in tonight.
 It's good to take things slow.
 Please know that when invited you over, I didn't realize it was Valentine's day.
 You still have that rotting jack-o'-lantern in the hallway, so I feel like you don't have a great sense of what month it is.
 It's just gotten so small that I kinda wanna see if it disappears.
 So first date stuff.
 Where are you from? There's a really interesting answer to that question, actually.
 I was born on the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania.
 I feel like I should do the right thing and tell you that your breast is falling out of your blouse, and I can see all of it.
 I guess we just jumped ahead to date four.
 Not the good one, either.
 Jack Donaghy's office.
 Jonathan! Our Jonathan, who art in the office, hallowed be my reservation.
 If you are able, hold my table, at Plunder, as we will not be there by 7.
 Have them delay our heavenly dessert, and forgive us our lateness, as we forgive those who cause lateness against us Thank you for explaining.
 I always wanted to know how a universal remote works.
 That's how it does.
 Would you excuse me just one second? I'll be right back.
 Cheese stew! What was I thinking? Your brownies are burning.
 You want me to take 'em out? Yes, please.
 But whatever you do, don't open that kitchen window Too soon! The draft made the door fly open! I know, not a big deal.
 So we skipped from date 4 to date 20.
 No, date never.
 I would never let that happen.
 It's OK, I'm a doctor.
 I've seen much worse.
 Really? Just kidding.
 That was pretty bad.
 Hold on.
 Sorry.
 I have to get this.
 Hello, Mandy.
 No, I'm downstairs in 3B.
 Why? You can't just drop her off without calling.
 Mandy? Is that like a guy friend? Like Mandy Patinkin? I can't.
 Because I am on a date right now.
 Mandy, don't hang up.
 Sorry.
 That was my ex-wife.
 My daughter Bethany is on her way up.
 You have a daughter? You'll see her.
 You'll say she's cute.
 But let me just say that she is complicated.
 My mother usually watches her when I can't, but she has been in the hospital recently, and she's not doing very well.
 And that has been hard for me to handle.
 I'm sorry that all this keeps falling apart.
 I was really looking forward to tonight.
 We can try again some other time.
 Or I'm listening.
 Maybe tonight is a gift.
 Maybe we embrace the toilet thing, and the bra incident, and my ex-wife, and my daughter, and get it all out in one night.
 If by the end of it we still like each other, then maybe it's the real thing.
 That would be Bethany.
 This is it.
 The express train is leaving the station.
 I'm on the train.
 Mom's keying your car.
 Bethany, this is Liz.
 Hi, it's so nice to mee Why does it smell in here? Cheese stew.
 I got sick.
 OK, be nice.
 I'll be right back after I go talk to your mother.
 And give me your purse.
 Why don't you ever trust me? Because, honey, you keep setting fire to things.
 And now, a prayer for the pregnant members of our congregation.
 Anita Alvarez Anna Alvarez Anabel Alvarez Honey, this is a Catholic church.
 We'll be here until morning.
 All right, you've been good.
 Let's go.
 We just have to go to confession before we leave.
 Benita Alveroz.
 Here's how this is gonna go.
 We're gonna sit here in silence for about 3 minutes, then I'm going to take my girlfriend to Plunder, where the pope himself could not get a table.
 You sound troubled, my son.
 Can it, Father.
 That was a nice try, though.
 That limo ride was weird.
 It felt like we just circled the block 50 times.
 That's how you get to Manhattan's fanciest restaurant.
 Monsieur Parcell.
 Votre table est prête.
 I didn't know it was a French restaurant.
 Yes, I found it on my favorite web site Stopshowingoff.
com.
 It's busy tonight.
 It's the best darn-tootenest restaurant in all of New York.
 This is the best night ever, thank you, Kenneth.
 You're one in a million.
 Man, can you believe we're working on Valentine's night? My fiancee's gonna be upset.
 Not to worry.
 I sent her flowers and a beautiful card.
 You're the best.
 Don't you have faith? I have faith in things I can see, and buy, and deregulate.
 Capitalism is my religion.
 You wanna have an intellectual argument? Fine.
 But I should warn you, I went to Princeton.
 I went to Harvard divinity school.
 You crimson guys never miss a chance, do you? You want a confession? Let's get this done so I'm gonna eat.
 I'm divorced.
 I take the Lord's name in vain often and with great relish.
 I hit my mother with a car, possibly by accident.
 I almost let him choke to death right there on the football field.
 I looked the other way when my wig-based parent company turned a bunch of children orange.
 I once claimed, "I am God" during a deposition.
 And I may have sodomized our former vice president while under the influence of some weapons-grade narcotics.
 It feels good to say that out loud, actually.
 That one was weighting on me.
 I don't know what to say.
 Don't want you to say anything.
 I already made that clear.
 Then what brought you here tonight? What brought me here? What brings anyone anywhere? Why do men build bridges? Why are there jets? I was hoping to have sex tonight.
 Have you ever made love to a woman, Father? Come on, man.
 Imagine cradling your face into the curve of a velvety-soft neck.
 Your hands cupping the warm heft of the greatest pair of I need backup! Harvard did not prepare me for this.
 Father? I like your bracelets.
 Girls at my school get them for doing different things on the bus.
 Blue's for showing your boobs.
 Purple's for doing stuff over your clothes.
 Black is for doing stuff Your mom left.
 How are you two getting along? She had some more stew while you were outside.
 Liz, did you kill the whole bottle? What? Sorry Yes, Gloria.
 Why are you crying? How many ex-wives does he have? That's my aunt.
 She's not gonna like you.
 No, of course.
 I'll be there as soon as I can.
 Good-bye.
 Mom has taken a turn.
 I'm so sorry.
 I know we said that we would take this in fast motion tonight, but I know.
 I really am glad we did, cause I don't think I could handle this by myself.
 What? Liz knew.
 Entertainment? Not just any entertainment.
 The best singer in the world Michael McDonald.
 He does not sound good live! OK, in English.
 You tortured that poor priest.
 Let me ask you something.
 Do you even believe in the teachings of the Catholic church? But I saw your photo with the Pope.
 That's just good business.
 I have photos with a lot of people.
 The Dalai Lama, Rabbi Yosef, Toby Keith.
 I see.
 You have no faith, only business.
 You know what your problem is? You intellectualize everything with your big head.
 Well, you have big boobs! Which you'll never touch again! This conversation has taken an unfortunate turn.
 Maybe this is God trying to tell me that we do not belong together.
 Maybe this is a sign.
 Look, my driver just pulled up.
 That's a sign.
 God wants us to leave here, get a good meal, and go to town on each other.
 How dare you say something like that so close to the statue of Santa Lucia, the patron Saint of judgmental statues! Go to your stupid restaurant.
 Eat your gold ice cream.
 Please come with me.
 You blew it.
 And now you will never see the crazy underwears I have on! What kind of god would let that happen? Finally Who's this? This is Liz.
 This is our first date.
 On Valentine's day? Funny story.
 He saw me on the toilet Dr.
 Baird, your mother's asked to speak to you privately.
 I'm sorry.
 Is this, like, a Sixth Sense thing? Should I bring a place setting for your friend? Mom Who is that? That's my friend Liz.
 Hi, Mrs.
 Baird.
 It's too soon, Andrew.
 I know.
 We tried to take it slow Life! I have more I want to do.
 Right, you.
 Of course.
 I'm gonna grab her chart.
 I'll be right back.
 You look terrible.
 No, I'm not Mandy.
 I'm Liz.
 Mandy, you have to tell Drew something for me.
 The woman he thinks is his sister is really his mother.
 What? I'm his grandmother.
 You have to tell him, or I won't get into heaven.
 Thank you for a truly unbelievable evening.
 It doesn't have to end here, y'allsies.
 Wait.
 This isn't right.
 Kenneth, why do you suddenly sound white? I lied to you.
 I was too scared to talk to you, so my sophisticated friend Tracy said the things that I couldn't.
 I'm very, very sorry.
 If you could've talked to me, what would you have said? That you're the sweetest, prettiest, blindest girl I've ever met.
 And when I'm with you, my heart jumps like a frog on July asphalt, right before it dies.
 You're so beautiful on the inside, Kenneth Parcell.
 Can I feel your face? Look at the time.
 I forgot, I have a a thing.
 That is cold, blind lady! And by the way, you're not so attractive yourself! No, I'm pretty sure I'm hot.
 Yes, you are.
 I tried.
 I'm so sorry.
 Thank you so much for being so great during all this.
 Let's do this again sometime.
 Except have it not be anything like this at all.
 Good night.
 Good night.
 You know my mom did just die.
 Funny story Hear me out.
 I'll have a A McFlurry, please.
 A McFlurry, please.
 And I have a coupon.
 You know where I found it? In the collection plate.
 It was a sign.
 I followed it, and it brought us back together.
 Now do you believe? I believe.
 I believe we were reunited by the most successful capitalist enterprise of the last hundred years, despite the McLean Deluxe, or the McEmu.
 Whatever.
 Someone's trying to tell us that we belong together.
 Maybe it's God.
 Maybe it's Ray Kroc.
 Maybe it's the hamburglar.
 Happy Valentine's day, querida.
 Happy St.
 Valentine's day, mi amor.
 Boy I hope that guy's not planning to kill her and eat her.
 You're such a romantic.
   

                




                    			Are you sure you don't wanna go to a real restaurant? No, this food cart is great.
 Look at this guy.
 He used to be a man once.
 What is that supposed to mean? Don't you want what he has someday Family, wife, children? Lemon, you're a woman.
 Of course I am! That doctor was a quack.
 I don't know why my parents listened to him.
 I need advice.
 Elisa is coming by this afternoon to talk about us.
 Ladies are such a bummer.
 "Where is this going?" "How serious are we?" "Why don't you listen to my story about my friend?" Where is it going? Ladies like to know what that next step is.
 They We can't help ourselves.
 Believe me, I wanna take that next step.
 You mean, marriage? No, the one before that.
 Moving in together? That's huge.
 No, the thing you do before that.
 Think you in the mid-'90s.
 You haven't had sex? She had a very strict, very religious upbringing.
 She does not take that step lightly.
 We have of course pleasured one another.
 Stop! I will leave.
 But she wants me to make some kind of commitment before we go forward.
 Obviously, I care about her a lot.
 But she keeps confusing me with this ridiculous notion that sex and love are somehow connected.
 Two things.
 One, be honest.
 If this is a big deal to her, do not take that next step unless you are sure.
 And second, and more importantly, in 2009, I have done it two more times than you! Give it up.
 What, what? Do not leave a brother hanging.
 Episode 312: "Larry King" You ready for Larry King Live tonight? You know it.
 I cursed for 3 hours straight just to get it out of system, you dumb bitch! Listen, we have a request.
 Can you please try to remember to talk about TGS tonight? You only have to plug it once.
 TGS, Fridays at 10:30 on NBC.
 You got it.
 NGS, Fridays at C:30 on TB10.
 Thank you.
 This says you're calling me.
 How is that possible? This phone was left in my cab by a woman wearing the shirt of a man.
 You left your phone in his car.
 Hi, I'm Liz.
 You have my phone? Yes.
 This is Asif.
 I am in Queens taxi dispatch in Long Island City.
 You come.
 I will, thank you.
 Why do you have Tracy Jordan's phone number in your address book? I work with him.
 If you want, I could bring a signed photo.
 You bring $800, rich lady, or I throw the phone away! What? I'll definitely do that.
 On Opposite Day! I'm new to this country.
 Is that a real thing? Hi, baby.
 I got you something to remember me while I'm in Puerto Rico.
 It's a caricature of me on a skateboard.
 So you're still planning on taking your trip? I've been going home every winter for the last 15 years.
 I guess I could consider staying, if I knew where this was going.
 And the woman talk begins.
 Well played.
 You know I'm serious about us.
 We're great together.
 We're Jack and Elisa.
 "Jalisa.
" That's really lame, Jack.
 That was just a joke.
 I don't wanna get all Mark Anthony on you, but I need to know how you feel.
 I love you.
 I love you.
 I love you too, Jack Donaghy.
 Then you'll stay? OK, I'll stay.
 But if I have to give up my trip, then I want us to spend that time together.
 Just us Jalisa.
 Clear my schedule for the next week, starting with tonight.
 You won't be coming in at all? But what about Jackonathan? I think tonight is going to be a very special night, if you know what I mean.
 I think I do.
 Don't forget your skateboard.
 But then he scores a basket, even though he's not a wolf anymore.
 We're here with Tracy Jordan who just recounted, by the way, the entire plot of the movie Teen Wolf.
 What? Hold on, Tracy.
 My producers are telling me there is breaking news.
 The Asian financial markets have just opened to a huge sell-off.
 And we're gonna switch to that story right now.
 Good.
 I'm glad I'm here.
 Your thoughts, on how this is gonna impact Wall Street.
 I'm not an expert, but I do have a strong opinion.
 New York, as we know it, will no longer exist tomorrow.
 Expand on that.
 I grew up here, in the days before Starbuck.
 And if Wall Street crashes, it'll be the 1970s all over again.
 People will get mean.
 The streets won't be safe.
 It'll be graffiti everywhere.
 And the movies will only cost $3.
 Tracy Jordan, saying three serious things, and then a joke.
 Have you taken a gander at the Asian markets? The chuffa volatility index is off the charts.
 Good luck with that, Jorgenson, but I'm on vacation now.
 But I have these papers.
 How you doing? Like a lion, ready to take its mate.
 How are you calling me? I lost my phone, and this jagweed cabbie has it.
 Stop harassing my friends, Asif.
 I just wanted to let you know, I found that special picture that you took with your phone.
 What picture? Oh, my God! Yes.
 That one.
 There's a picture on my phone.
 An adult picture of me! What? Drew took it as a joke.
 I'm making a face like this, like Why am I telling you this! Top and bottom? May I speak with Asif? What do you want? 2,000 in cash, or I email the picture to everyone in your address book.
 Have you been to Asia? My work has taken me there.
 I was supposed to be in Rush Hour, but 2 weeks into shooting, I was replaced by Jackie Chan.
 I'm going to get my phone.
 You're gonna pay that guy? You know, I need my address book and stuff.
 But I'm not going alone to meet some creep at a taxi garage.
 Will one of you go with me? Good luck.
 I would, but I don't want to.
 I will escort you.
 We pages are accustomed to danger.
 Thank you.
 Can you leave now? This place is in Queens.
 I can't leave Manhattan on page business.
 NBC's insurance doesn't cover it.
 I'll have to do this as a friend.
 OK, fine.
 Say it.
 Say I'm your friend.
 Fine.
 You're my friend.
 Let's go.
 The Mumbai stock exchange is now down in early trading.
 Is this panic becoming global? Tracy Jordan, talk us through this.
 What everyone needs to do is just take a deep breath, calm down, and start preparing their bodies for the Thunderdome.
 That is the new law.
 That's my TV! This is as far as we can get by subway.
 We need to find a cab.
 This is a pretty bad neighborhood.
 I just got tagged! Mr.
 Jordan and Mr.
 Larry king are right.
 New York is not safe anymore.
 And I am not risking your life for a cell phone.
 It's not just the phone, it's what's on it.
 I don't understand.
 What could be so important? It wasn't something of sentimental value, was it? Very sentimental.
 It's a song, a lullaby that my Nana Lemon used to sing to me every night.
 Was it "The day is done, my sweet, for the lambs have been decapitated"? It was a German song.
 She was German.
 And my Nana got very sick recently, and I went to visit her, and I had her sing it for me one final time.
 I recorded that song on my phone.
 And I'm glad that I did because she died a few hours later.
 It was my birthday.
 I am so sorry.
 Would you sing it for me? Stop.
 Now that I know the reason we are doing this is not only moral, but beautiful, then I will not rest until I get my friend her phone.
 OK, come on.
 That was amazing.
 Thank you.
 I watched an American Masters last night about Baryshnikov.
 I picked up a couple of idea Our sushi.
 I'll get it.
 You'll need your rest.
 We're going again in 15.
 You've got company.
 Why aren't you answering? What are you doing here? People are freaking out about this Asia thing, and we can't find Geiss.
 He's AWOL.
 Now everyone's looking to you.
 I don't care what's going on out there.
 I'm staying here.
 There are things more important than a stock quote crawling across a screen.
 I am in love with this magnificent woman, and no amount of money this company could lose would cause me to Yes, that's the amount.
 I'll get dressed right now.
 Bill Hewitt, under-Secretary of the Treasury, what advice can you give our viewers in these uncertain times? The worst thing you can do at a time like this is to pull out your investments.
 Don't panic because Devil's avocado here.
 I think people should freak the geek out! Withdraw all your money and hide it.
 Interesting strategy.
 It's what I've always done.
 I hide cash everywhere.
 At home, at church.
 Even at work.
 In fact, I've hidden so much money that if some of it was gone, I probably wouldn't even notice.
 Now, why would you say that? I don't know.
 Don't worry, I'll protect you.
 It's just kids Bad young men! Shame on you! What is going on with people?! They took my wallet.
 Was this Nana Lemon? She's the one we're doing this for.
 She's dead.
 Come on.
 Wait, why is she wearing these glasses? It's from New Year's.
 You said she died on your birthday.
 That's in November.
 That's not a New Year's thing.
 That's the year she wanted to live to.
 And she didn't make it.
 Sing that lullaby again.
 Keep going.
 Von 99 luftballons I knew it! That's 99 red balloons.
 Nena's famous anti-balloon protest song.
 You lied to me.
 Alright, I lied.
 So what! You want the truth? I can't handle the truth.
 There is an adult picture of me on that phone.
 Adult? You mean, like, you're driving a car or wearing a suit? It's a boobies picture! I kept it because for once they were both pointing in the same direction! I knew you wouldn't help me if I told you the truth.
 So you lied to me? That's not something that friends do to each other.
 Then, maybe we're not friends.
 But we are.
 You said so before we left.
 You made me say that.
 Then, I guess I'm here as a page, and in violation of NBC's insurance policy.
 I should probably head back to Manhattan.
 Good.
 I don't need you Co-worker.
 Did you get a hold of Geiss? Did you try his mistress? Not there.
 How about his manstress? Nothing.
 I think we should listen to Tracy Jordan and panic, sir.
 I'm saying the disneyfication of new York is over, everyone.
 At the stroke of midnight, your Lexus is gonna turn back into a high pile of rats fighting over a human finger.
 Joining us on the phone is G.
E.
 Vice president Jack Donaghy.
 What's your outlook on all of this? I just want to preach caution.
 If there were anything to worry about, I would be at my office, instead of at home right now with my beautiful girlfriend.
 She's Latin.
 Expand on that.
 Look, my point is some of the things that Tracy is saying are just fanning the flames.
 Hang on.
 I know Jack Donaghy.
 And that is an imposter.
 Hang up.
 Hang up on him! I'm going to, but not because you told me.
 Lincoln, Nebraska, you are on the air.
 So is this what you'd rather be doing instead of spending time with me? It smells like dude in here! I called you, why didn't you pick up? Because I'm sick of listening to you.
 "Oh, I love you, Elisa.
" This was all just another Jack Donaghy lie! Like when you said you could dunk a basketball.
 I can on a regulation hoop.
 This is an emergency.
 If I'm not here tonight What? What's gonna happen? People are gonna die? No.
 You'll all just get poor, like the rest of us.
 You'll eat cereal that comes in a bag, and you'll keep the free hand wipes from the casino.
 You might even have to spend some time with your children.
 Who is this woman? Why isn't someone shutting her up? Why don't you just go back to my apartment, and I will meet you there eventually.
 Don't worry about it.
 I'm going to Puerto Rico! Don't do that.
 You don't understand.
 What's happening here is a once in a lifetime thing.
 So am I.
 That was kind of neat how she just whoop Flipped your words around on you there.
 Sorry.
 Forget it.
 We're never gonna find Tracy's money.
 There's something under here.
 It's nothing but a bunch of tarantula food.
 What I didn't eve know Tracy had a tarantula.
 You know what, there's an easier way to do this.
 Our next caller is Pete from Manhattan.
 What's your question? First-time caller.
 Adore the show.
 I'd recognize that voice anywhere! That's my friend Peter Frampton on the phone.
 Sure.
 Listen, I love the idea of hiding cash at work.
 Can you be more specific about where you hid your money? Of course! I hid my money in the safest place at 30 Rock.
 Without giving it away, the place I picked is very dry and warm.
 Its top is hard, but its bottom is soft.
 And although the location changes all the time, the money stays in the same place.
 If you are just joining us, we're with Tracy Jordan, who is giving guitar icon Peter Frampton enigmatic clues about a secret treasure.
 Stay with us.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, this just arrived.
 It's from Mr.
 Geiss.
 Everything's gonna be all right.
 Geiss is back.
 Can we even play this thing? Yes.
 I keep a VCR so I can watch your old football tapes.
 What is that camcorder for? Nothing.
 I don't know.
 Hello.
 If you're watching this, you are an executive of the General Electric corporation, and the unthinkable is happening.
 Capitalism is ending, either because of the Soviets or something ridiculous, like a woman president.
 God, he looks so young.
 I'm speaking to you in the year 1987, but my message is timeless.
 Avoid the noid.
 We've all worked hard, but now it's over.
 There's only one thing for you to do.
 Go to your loved ones.
 Hold them close.
 Because in the end, and if you're watching this, it is the end.
 Love is all that matters.
 Now, how the hell am I gonna turn this damn thing off? What's that gizmo? I was about to do the whole run to the airport thing, like Ross did on Friends, and Liz Lemon did in real life.
 What are you doing here? The taxis want 500 bucks to go to JFK, and the buses are worse! Everything's gone coco for cuckoo-poops! Is that right? Listen to me.
 I meant everything I said, but I know that that's just words.
 You want commitment? Here it is.
 Let's get married.
 I love you.
 And I don't wanna be with anyone else.
 But I want a ring so big that it gives me back problems.
 That's my phone.
 I'm Liz Lemon.
 Where is the $2,000? I don't have it.
 I lost all my money and my bank cards and my retainer! Please, Asif, give me my phone.
 Maybe you could call a friend to get the money.
 Or wait.
 Every number in this address book is a work number.
 Work number, work number, work number.
 You have no friends.
 Yes I am.
 You have $2,000? I'm gonna watch TV until you come up with my money.
 Maybe you get it through sex trade.
 You very pretty young thing.
 You're disgusting.
 I'm not talking to you.
 Frank, calm down! It's not in here.
 This isn't about the money! This is about my own issues with Liz! Stop it! We have Peter Frampton on the phone again Come on, just tell us where the money is! Where's the safest place in 30 Rock? Is that Pete? I already told you.
 It's dry and warm.
 Its top is hard, but its bottom is soft.
 And although the location changes, it's always in the same place.
 There's nothing like that in 30 Rock! Nothing! I never said it was a thing.
 It's me.
 I am the safest place in 30 Rock.
 I would thank you to give the lady its cell phone back.
 Thank you for coming back.
 You're a good friend.
 You mean it? Because I'm having an asbestos removal party at my apartment on Sunday I'm in! Now that the U.
S.
 markets have opened, unaffected by the Asian meltdown, many people are blaming the panic in New York last night on one man Tracy Jordan.
 He is here with me now.
 A lot of people are calling you a fear monger, and I am quoting here, "an idiot".
 What do you have to say for yourself? Watch TGS, Fridays at 10:30 on NBC! Word! Morning.
 Morning, sir.
 Crazy night last night.
 Lots of emotions.
 People getting carried away.
 Yes, it was a crazy night.
 Is Elisa here? We're having a couples spa day.
 She came by earlier.
 She asked me to give you this.
 She said to just press play.
 Hi, Jack.
 I'm on my way to Puerto Rico.
 I'm sorry.
 Yesterday was crazy.
 Lots of emotion.
 I think maybe you asked me what you asked me out of panic.
 So I'm gonna go see my family, and give us both a chance to think about everything.
 OK, I'll call you.
 Adios, mi amor.
 Now, how do you turn this damn thing off? That's personal!   

                




                    			Thanks for coming out and for watching.
 Love, peace, and hair grease.
 Me, Lutz, Toofer, and Josh are gonna go to that bar where the waiters are dressed like ninjas.
 You in? No, I'm just gonna go to the 24-h donut place and go home.
 All right.
 Donuts and then bed.
 What are you depressed about or celebrating? It's this endless adoption process.
 It took me 3 months I am totally humiliated.
 How could you cut diaper chicken? Wait, I know.
 Because Tracy's the star.
 Oh brother, she's feeling neglected.
 How's she gonna act out this time? My ankle! Imaginary injury.
 I would have said death of a voice coach.
 Her birthday's on Tuesday.
 Maybe all that attention will make her ankle feel better.
 What are you still doing here? It's Friday night.
 I need something to do.
 Don't you have some gallery opening or a fundraiser to give bow ties to inner city youths? Of course.
 But I'm committed to Elisa.
 While she's away, I try to avoid temptation.
 I just need somewhere I can socialize where women aren't an issue.
 Finally! Ninja time! Episode 312: "Goodbye, My Friends" Excuse me? Can we get a little service over here I know you're getting these messages cause I know how to check your voicemail.
 You are officially a d-bag, Tim.
 I hope you lose your indoor soccer game.
 Sorry, what can I get you? A dozen assorted for me to take home to my family.
 And the lady will have A dozen assorted.
 Adoption brochure.
 Should you be working the night shift alone like this? It's fine.
 They gave me a gun.
 That's $6.
80.
 I will have mine to stay, please.
 You want a dozen donuts to stay? And a skim milk.
 What are you doing? Making a new friend.
 You have crazy eyes.
 You have shut-up mouth.
 I don't want any part of this.
 Then get out of here.
 That creative thing you guys do, writing jokes for a living, making the world laugh.
 What do your dads tell their friends you do? Surgeon.
 Optometrist.
 Died.
 I never really knew my dad.
 So, I just lie to myself.
 Space assassin.
 I grew up without a father too.
 Good ol'Billy Donaghy left when I was 2.
 He'd show up every now and then to impregnate my mom, punch out umpires in my little league.
 Last time I saw my dad, he went out to get the candles for my 4th birthday lasagna and never came back.
 My whole life I said I was gonna be something.
 Restore the glory of the Rossitano name.
 In sicilian dialect, it means "well poisoner".
 In gaelic, Donaghy means "dung basket".
 So, I worked my ass off at SUNY.
 Got into Fordham law.
 You went to law school? But I had to drop out after a semester cause my mom got sick.
 Mothers.
 What are we doing next, fellas? Don't tell me we're calling it a night.
 How lame do you think we are? The night is young.
 We're going to Lutz's to watch movies.
 Tonight, a classic.
 Harry and the Hendersons.
 You in, Jack? Yes, but I don't wanna go to Lutz's apartment.
 His contract is up and I don't wanna feel sorry for him.
 What do you say we go to my place? Sounds good.
 And when I told Tim I was pregnant, he just freaked out and didn't call me for a week.
 Then he texted me and he was like, "I love you.
 No, I'm mad at you.
 "You did this on purpose.
" As if.
 Meanwhile, his Myface page still says, "Status: horny".
 And I'm, like, "If you care about me at all, "at least have the decency to Skype me face to face.
" Man, there are just so many different devices for guys to not call you on now.
 When I was your age, you could just be like, "He probably tried to call me but my line was busy.
" And then just watch Falcon Crest and cry yourself to sleep.
 Thanks for listening to me blab.
 So, what's your plan when the baby comes? I don't know.
 Been talking to an adoption lady, but I don't feel comfortable with them people.
 They all just seem really old and weird.
 Not one of them even knew who Neo is.
 I need you Finally, thank you.
 Somebody cool for once.
 Get out of here! Can't you see we don't want you anymore? Why can't you go back where you came from? And leave us alone! Go.
 Goodbye, my friend.
 He had to be mean to save him.
 Harry belonged in the woods.
 It gets me every time.
 This reminds me of my favorite movie.
 Shane.
 When Joey wants to go with Shane and Shane makes him stay? Maybe it's because we didn't have fathers.
 Maybe that's why we're drawn to movies where the father-figure pushes away the child/legendary north-american forest ape.
 But in the movies, it's a good thing.
 Harry went back to the woods.
 It works out in real life too.
 We're both doing all right.
 Excuse me, Mr.
 Jordan.
 I was updating my staff birthday list and I discovered I don't have yours.
 That's because I don't have a birthday.
 What? I don't have a birth certificate cause I was born inside of Yankee Stadium.
 I bounced around foster families so much, no one ever bothered to throw me a party.
 But even prisoners have birthday parties.
 I saw one on Oz.
 It was interesting.
 I don't need a birthday.
 I buy myself all the presents I need.
 And because of my drinking, they're often a surprise.
 But birthdays aren't about presents.
 They're about being surrounded by people who love you, eating a cake with your name on it and making a wish.
 I'm sad you never had that.
 My birthday's September 21st, not that anyone asked.
 This morning it hit me in the shower why the Hendersons named their guest Harry.
 That film has layers.
 I was also thinking about what you told me about your family and law school.
 Sorry.
 I was drunk.
 I shouldn't have told you that stuff.
 No, I'm glad you did.
 We have a lot in common.
 We both have dreams about being overpowered by a female bodybuilder.
 OK, we were both drunk.
 But I wanna help you.
 So I made some phone calls and if you want, you can resume your law studies at Columbia, this semester, full scholarship, no strings attached.
 Are you serious? Make your mother proud.
 Make your father hate any new children he might have.
 But I've got a whole other life now.
 I guess.
 But we both know you shouldn't be working at a desk with Fake vomit on it.
 Right.
 Fake Excuse me.
 Please don't be a daughter I didn't know about.
 Congratulations.
 What is she doing here? She's the show's new youth consultant.
 It's a thing.
 The CW has them.
 Can't believe you're in charge of all this.
 It is challenging and satisfying but it can't fulfill all of me.
 I've got so much more to give.
 Welcome.
 So do you want me to start youth consulting now? Because kids would not be into that.
 That guy's the worst.
 This is the dress I'll be wearing to my birthday party.
 Make sure no one else plans to wear the same thing.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Did you know Mr.
 Jordan has never had a birthday party? He was too poor growing up.
 That's horrible.
 My heart goes out to all the inner city kids.
 Especially those too fat to dance their way out.
 I'm glad you feel that way, cause we have this big party planned for you.
 I know.
 And we thought you could share it with Mr.
 Jordan.
 The party, the attention, everything.
 Isn't that a great idea? That's so great.
 I can't believe Tim hasn't called.
 I guess I don't even care about us anymore.
 But this is his baby.
 I mean, him not even being there for the kid is totally washed.
 Typical Tim.
 Anyway.
 I guess I have two choices.
 Go back home, try to get back with Tim and keep the baby, or give up the baby and focus on my music.
 So Tim, keep baby.
 Music, give up baby.
 Can I play you one of my songs? Now we are joined In a cobweb of rainbows Stop.
 Stop right there.
 Tears.
 The world needs to hear your music.
 You have crossed a line.
 She's never gonna make it with those songs.
 Says who? Being terrible has never prevented success in the music business.
 Look at Biz Markie or The Doors.
 Before we were happily married with five kids, Paula and I were Tim and Becca.
 I tell you, she is confused and he is terrified.
 He ran away! So did I! Five times.
 But I came back.
 And when my caveman brain saw those babies with their little Hornberger foreheads it clicked.
 You gotta give them the same chance.
 What are you doing? My pregnant teen message board says the baby gets all its food from the mother, so you have to give it stuff it likes.
 No, the baby can't taste anything it just gets nutrients from you.
 I'm gonna post a reply to Juno32 and tell her she's a giant asswipe.
 I can't believe you don't have kids.
 What's that? Well, you'd make such a great mom.
 You're smart, succesul, grounded.
 Go on.
 You already dress like a mom.
 And stop.
 It's not the right time for me to have a family, but Is that something you'd want? Yeah, Becca.
 It is.
 Will you sing with me? I'd ra Mothers and fathers And jugglers and judges Now we are joined in a cobweb of rainbows He's coming! The plan is working! I bit my tongue! Surprise! What a schmo, entering first.
 Now I'm the headliner and he's just the warm-up act.
 I'm Mr.
 Don Rickles and he's just me.
 But I don't have a birthday! You do now cause we all love you and wanted you to feel this joy.
 I do feel it.
 You're all so amazing.
 And to think I was just calling y'all a bunch of racists.
 Stop Jenna time.
 Friends, I am leaving TGS for Columbia law school to pursue my dream of becoming a lawyer.
 Did you know that if you sing "Happy Birthday" on a TV show you have to pay for it? I did not know that.
 My dad got us all seats for opening day at the new Yankee Stadium! No one ask me about my back brace.
 Make a wish, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Blow out the candles.
 No one ask me about my back brace! Is that you? I decided to take up on your offer.
 Good man, and you went to my tailor.
 That's the same cut Reagan wore the day he got shot.
 My mom is going nuts.
 She's insisting you come over and let her cook dinner.
 Home cooked italian? I'm there.
 Now let me hear you say the 7 most important words in the american judicial system.
 My client has no memory of that.
 I also would have accepted, "can't prove that's the governor's semen.
" What's the matter, Mr.
 Jordan? You only make cheese friends when something's bothering you.
 You were right.
 Birthdays are special.
 And now mine's over.
 And who knows when February 24th will come again? Now that warm, happy feeling is gone, there's no cake in my mouth, and that birthday wish is malarkey.
 Malarkey! Come on, Daniel.
 I am so proud of you.
 A lawyer.
 Someday you'll have an ad on the subway in english and spanish.
 And this man.
 What you have done for my boy.
 Go open up some more wine.
 You got it, mom.
 What do you think you're doing to my boy? I'm trying to help him.
 I see myself in Frank.
 We have fathers that abandoned us.
 What do you know about his father? You want him to be a lawyer so he won't be like his father? His father was a lawyer! And his father's father.
 All the Rossitano men are lawyers.
 It's in their blood to be lawyers! Then what's the For the mob! What? Frankie's father didn't abandon him.
 He's in hiding in Phoenix.
 Every Rossitano man is either in hiding or six feet under.
 You want me to paint you a picture? Cause I did! It's part of a therapy through painting thing.
 I had no idea.
 Well, you shoulda guessed.
 I don't think I should have.
 Whatever.
 I'm not gonna take my kid's dream away from him.
 You made this mess, you clean it up.
 I don't care how.
 But Francis Rossitano cannot become a lawyer.
 Hold on a second.
 Do you know a Tim? What? Why? Security says that there's a Tim Baker downstairs.
 Here? He came here? That's Becca's ex-boyfriend.
 Tell them to send him to 15.
 He's coming to steal my baby.
 Don't even ask about the wheelchair.
 Also, my old vocal coach died! Come on, come on.
 Lemon, are you OK? That pregnant girl, she was going to give me her baby.
 But now that dad is here, he's gonna ruin everything.
 What are you about to do? I'm the one who's been there for her for almost two days.
 This Tim guy is totally washed! There was once a great American named George Henderson.
 He met a woodland ape, or sasquatch, and despite its dangerous message of environmentalism, became his friend.
 When time came to do the hard thing and send it back into the forest where it belonged and birds could perch on its shoulder because it was gentle, George Henderson summoned the strength and by God, he did it.
 Did it hurt? You bet it hurt.
 Like a bastard.
 But he did it because it was the right thing to do For the woodland ape.
 You think about that.
 What? Is that Harry and the Hendersons? You've seen it? This is my life, Jack.
 Miss Maroney, are you OK? I think I'll be OK in time for tomorrow's show.
 But then I have to go in for more tests.
 I'm so brave.
 I wish you felt better so you could help us figure out what Mr.
 Jordan's birthday wish coulda been.
 What? Why? So we can make it come true and his birthday can go on and on.
 We've narrowed it down to "own a Robocop, "hunt that elephant that paints, "or breakfast in bed.
" But it wasn't his birthday.
 It was my birthday.
 Forget it.
 I'm tired of making you people try to care for me.
 You don't care for me, clearly.
 Nobody does.
 My birthday wish came true! What? I wished for you to get better.
 I was gonna wish for breakfast in bed with Robocop while an elephant paints us.
 We were close.
 Then I saw you with that back brace on right before I blew out my candles.
 It's a birthday miracle! That's the kindest thing anyone's ever done for me.
 Now let's make Miss Maroney's birthday wish come true.
 That's so sweet.
 But who would I celebrate with if y'all were in a car accident? Are you Tim? Becca's Tim? I'm her friend, Jenna.
 And she does not wanna see you.
 She's very mad and she wants you to leave.
 That's That's for the best.
 Excuse me.
 What floor is the Sci-Fi channel on? Fine, Lithgow.
 I'll do the right thing.
 God! I guess someone's been watching The World According to Garp.
 Damn it, wait.
 Becca does wanna see you.
 She wants it more than anything, OK? When you said she didn't wanna see me, it was such a relief.
 This baby thing is freaking me out.
 You know how many people want what just got dropped in your lap? "Now's not a good time.
 I wanna go to Burning Man.
" Shut up! Do you love Becca? She's like my soul mate.
 You're not listening, dummy! Nut up right now, get a job, and help raise that kid.
 Love it because it has your goony face and get married and have disposable cameras at the wedding because it's fun and people like it.
 Where are we going? I already cleaned out my office.
 You've gotta go back where you belong.
 You've gotta go.
 No, I'm gonna be a lawyer.
 I'm going to be like you.
 Get outta here! Go to the writer's room! There is no scholarship! Can't you see we don't want you anymore? Think about it.
 Do you really want your kid to grow up without a father? I don't understand.
 Why don't you go back where you came from? Leave me alone! Goodbye, my friend.
 Those two, they both grew up without fathers.
 Hey, baby.
 My God.
 Look at your boobs.
 Kiss or something.
 Go on.
 Rainbows and the cobwebs And the cobwebs of the rainbows And stop.
 I guess, in a way, we both lost children today.
 Yeah, but mine was real.
 Yours was Frank.
 Don't worry.
 I'm confident that someday you'll have everything you want.
 Can someone tell me how to get out of this building? It's like a maze! I keep walking past the same Sbarro's! I'm a celebrity! Please! Sad   

                




                    			Miss Lemon! Let me help you out.
 Thanks, Kenneth.
 What are all these little plastic containers for? Are you pickling squirrel meat? Cause I can lend you my skull presser.
 No, I went to the new flagship compartment store on 5th Avenue and got everything I need to get my life in order.
 A stacker thing to separate junk mail from your humidifier catalogs.
 A thing you stick on your laptop that holds your keys.
 A round plastic deal that holds your shoes with a pocket for a photograph of what shoes are in there.
 I'm going to become wonderful.
 It's a new beginning.
 Like a phoenix rise Look out! Or maybe this is gonna be the worst day ever.
 Episode 314: "The Funcooker" Morning meeting.
 Everybody shut up.
 Shut up, Lutz.
 Already today, I have lost faith in decor-ganizing, chipped a tooth And lost a shoving match to what I thought was a female bike messenger.
 So I am asking all of you for the next 12 to 14 hours to just be cool.
 Let's have a normal day.
 Guys, seriously, be cool.
 Why are you not wearing pants? They still have the heat set for winter, and my office is boiling.
 Put on your pants! Please make me a dentist appointment today.
 You can't go today.
 You have jury duty.
 What? No! I'm registered in Illinois.
 How did New York find me? I changed your voter registration for you.
 What's wrong? You told me to be more proactive.
 I told you to buy more Proactiv! Mr.
 Donaghy wants to see you now about what Jenna and Tracy did during St.
 Patrick's Day parade.
 Was it something good? Have a seat.
 It was very simple.
 I asked you two to host NBC's coverage of St.
 Patrick's Day parade.
 Read the cue cards.
 Promote the show.
 So would you explain to Mr.
 O'Cannon why it went so very wrong? Sir, as I'm sure you know from reading my blog, I'm currently shooting a feature film inspired by, but, for legal reasons, not based on Janis Joplin.
 Synonym's just another word for the word you wanna use We can't sing the original songs, but it's gonna be phenomenal.
 But, between the movie at night and working here during the day, I am so exhausted.
 So when I got to the parade That's no excuse, ye banshee.
 You and this gravy face have slarneyed up a real donnybrook.
 Here comes the County Cork steppers.
 Their traditional dance celebrates the spirit and the ingenuity of the Irish people.
 Wake up, mother You're a disgrace.
 Passing out and cursing on St.
 Patrick's Day? Is nothing sacred? I should be rewarded for going this long without swearing on live TV.
 The FCC disagrees.
 They've decided to make an example of you and fine you personally $50,000.
 50 grand? Can anyone cut this in half? Look at you! I told you.
 You're spreading yourself too thin.
 I only heard the thin part.
 Lemon is right.
 Obviously, you can't do both TGS and Janie Jimplin.
 I choose the movie.
 My face is bigger on it.
 I don't mean quit, Liz will find a way to make both work.
 Am I right? I'll have to use you less in the show.
 And I'll scale back the movie.
 We could cut the lesbian scene.
 But the Oscars love that kind of thing.
 There's 2 guys in my gym named Oscar.
 You have got to start taking care of yourself.
 You're a wreck.
 I am fine.
 That's a glue stick.
 You're going to the doctor.
 OK, great meeting.
 Let's try to have a calm week downstairs, shall we? Yes, I'm trying.
 I don't need any distractions.
 On Friday, Microwaves is announcing a very big project or, should I say, very little? The pocket microwave? You can buy it on Friday along with everyone else.
 It has a ham button.
 You used my idea! I understand what it's like having too much on your plate.
 Between medical practice and this job, I'm pulled in every direction.
 What can I do? I haven't been this tired since I was forced to do that dance marathon in Dubai.
 I can give you these pamphlets on stress and diet and doing a movie and a TV show at same time.
 But they're all gonna tell you that you need to give something up.
 And they're wrong.
 You can burn the candle at both ends.
 Go on.
 My lab work is in the field of sleep research.
 Mostly because I checked the wrong box on a form once.
 We are currently working on a pill that keeps people awake under any circumstances.
 It's being funded by the U.
S.
 Military and the WNBA.
 Does it work? It's kept my lab rats awake for days.
 But we're looking for human subjects.
 Where do I sign up? Please, we don't want a paper trail.
 Take 25 of these a day for the rest of your life.
 I am going to jury duty, but I will be right back.
 I got my princess Leia outfit, some Playgirl magazines from the early 1980s.
 They will dismiss me immediately as a weirdo.
 Who's in charge while you're gone? Let's see.
 Pete is spending spring break with his kids, so no one.
 No one here is in charge in any way.
 If no one's in charge, who will yell at me for goofing up the lunch order? We all will, Kenneth.
 We all will.
 You guys are my best friends.
 There you are! You wanna buy half a watch? I have to pay my fine in cash.
 I guess FCC stands for Federal Bunch of Sticklers.
 I hope you've learned a lesson from this.
 I sure have.
 I learned that if you pay some money afterwards, you can say whatever you want on TV.
 I can even say what Ernest Borgnine whispered to me at Stop.
 That's not the lesson.
 That's always the lesson.
 If you have money, you can do whatever you want.
 Now I'm off to appear on Martha Stewart live.
 It's gonna be raunchy.
 Great news.
 I'm in the clinical trial for a military-grade anti-sleeping pill.
 Of course you are.
 Now I can still be on the show as much as you want and do the movie.
 Look how much energy I have.
 Come on, guys.
 I just have to go and get out of jury duty, and we can talk about all of this when I get back.
 I thought you left.
 Listen to me.
 I am not asking you this as the boss you love to undermine, but as the friend whose birthday you love to forget.
 Just be normal sauce for like two hours.
 Please.
 I will be right back.
 And I don't really think it's fair for me to be in a jury because I'm a hologram.
 You seem fine to me.
 Report to jury room B.
 Charles what now? The subject's unusually thirsty.
 Everyone shut up.
 Shut up, Lutz.
 Where's Lemon? She went to get out of jury duty.
 Can we get lunch from McDonald's? I need your creative input.
 I've spent the better part of last 3 years developing a portable, miniature microwave oven.
 Most of that time has been spent focused on coming up with a hip name for the product, that will appeal to the marketing holy trinity: college students, morbidly obese, and homosexuals.
 Unfortunately, legal just informed me that the name we settled on for our bite-size microwave, The Bitenuker, is highly offensive to those who speak French or Dutch.
 A Franco-Dutchman would pronounce it "Bet Nyuker".
 Zat's awful.
 I'm sorry, Miss Laroche-Van Der Hoot.
 This product rolls out in 2 days.
 We're in danger of losing the European market.
 Everyone here needs to brainstorm new names.
 Starting today, you are all members of the Microwave Division.
 We should make t-shirts! Yes.
 And you're in charge of that.
 Remember, this isn't TGS, guys.
 Let's not shoot to the middle this time.
 Absolutely not.
 Excuse me, imperial guard, how long do these arson trials typically last? Couple of weeks, probably.
 You can drop the voice.
 This used to get me out of jury duty in Chicago all the time.
 This ain't Chicago, honey.
 Look at these people.
 Studio 6H.
 It's Liz.
 Where are you? The pig spoor has hit the wind spinner.
 Mr.
 Jordan cursed at Martha Stewart, Miss Maroney drank all the water out of the toilets.
 And I keep starting to sneeze, but nothing comes out.
 What? Does anyone there listen to me? It's not my fault.
 You didn't put anyone in charge.
 I've been put on a jury.
 I'll head up there as soon as we are dismissed for the day.
 Try not to let anything else bad happen.
 I'm in charge.
 Attention, everyone.
 All menstruating women go home immediately.
 He's been doing that for almost eight hours, Dr.
 Vicky.
 You know what I like to do for 8 hours? The TV guide crossword puzzle.
 Give me your hand.
 Now look into my eyes.
 Now let's try one where you're not clawing at the window.
 I don't think so.
 This feels more natural.
 You're saying, "give me your hand.
" This is what my character would do.
 You're back.
 Guess I'm not in charge anymore.
 Guys? I've got a couple hours.
 Where is everybody? They're all dead.
 They're all dead unless they come up with a name for my pocket microwave.
 They're up in my office, where there are fewer foosballs.
 So who's writing the show? Now that you're back, I thought you could do it yourself.
 How hard can it be? "Hey, I'm rapping Obama.
" "Welcome to another episode of robot/bear talk show.
" I'm Josh doing an impression of De Niro as an auctioneer.
 "Do I hear $1,000? Do I hear $1,000?" Really good! Jenna fills in time with a song.
 "Good night, good night.
" Mild applause.
 You'll be done in an hour.
 In the meantime, any ideas for microwave names? The Small Wonder.
 The Micromate.
 The Porta-Hotty.
 If you're not going to take this seriously, then do your job.
 Write the show, and more important, deal with Tracy.
 How? That guy's got enough money to pay FCC fines for the next 200 years.
 Forget the fines.
 I've dealt with the FCC.
 And NBC is issuing an apology on Tracy's behalf.
 Your problem is your advertisers are pulling out.
 My god.
 With no ads No ads, no TGS.
 No TGS I see you self-publishing your novel and moving back in with your parents.
 I'll go talk to Tracy.
 Just catching up on some work.
 Really? What sounds more shocking? Or Here you go.
 Everything's OK.
 No, just because you have money doesn't mean you can say whatever *** thing that you want.
 This has gotten bigger than you just paying fines.
 Our sponsors are pulling out because of you.
 And if we don't have advertisers, they're gonna pull the plug on TGS.
 Think about how you're hurting the crew.
 I don't want to hurt the crew.
 I love the crew.
 All we do is joke around together about our stupid boss, Liz Lem Anyway, unless you know an advertiser that really wants to be associated with this, you need to stop.
 Great idea.
 Which part are you talking about? The first 2/3.
 I don't need to stop being myself if I am the advertiser.
 I have the money.
 I'll just buy up all the ads and let that hilarious Tracy Jordan character do whatever he wants.
 Put the phone down.
 You can't do that.
 Jack won't let you.
 We'll see about that.
 I need you to set up a meeting with you and the folks from ad sales.
 What do you mean you're not in charge anymore? Tracy Jordan from Tracyco called to invite you to a luncheon celebrating their new ad campaign.
 What Seriously, not now.
 All right, everyone, back to the drawing board.
 Legal rejected all of our ideas.
 Every names we came up with was offensive in some language.
 Including English.
 They knew what a Hot Richard was? So we're going to think outside the box a little bit here.
 I'm going to pick some random letters from this bag of Scrabble tiles.
 Let fate choose a name for us.
 Why don't we start over? I have an idea.
 Why don't I just pull them all at once? Why don't we take a break? Could you get Lemon on the phone for me, please? Ms.
 Gaulke, how long have you been an employee of Mailboxes Plus? I've been an assistant manager there for over seven years.
 And how would you describe the events that took place there on December 17th? The night of the fire.
 Christmas was always a very busy time at the store.
 Throw in a late Hanukkah and the fact that I work in a "Kwanzaa neighborhood", and it all made for a very stressful day.
 I sent Malik uptown for more 18-inch boxes, but he returned unrepentant with 12-inch ones.
 Christine was late, as well as Harry S.
 They said it was a problem with the subways, I suspect they were doing sex with each other.
 How many employees do you have, Ms.
 Gaulke? I supervise 12 employees, most of whom would be unemployable in any other field.
 They are selfish, irresponsible people who I know talk about me behind my back.
 They seem to think that their job is wasting my time and energy by making their every minuscule problem my personal responsibility.
 They don't care.
 And don't even get me started on Tracy and Jenna.
 And when the last one of them trundled off that night, I smelled the air, and I could feel that it was time.
 Time for a new beginning.
 And I knew that this was possible only through a cleansing fire.
 It would all have to burn.
 The packing peanuts, the delivery slips All of it would dance in the warm mouth of my fire.
 And a new, better, wonderful me would rise from the ashes like a phoenix.
 Behold the splendor of my beginning! I rest my case, your honor.
 Desperate times call for desperate measures.
 Underlings, I wanna hear your ideas.
 I knew this day would come.
 I have so much inside of me.
 My first idea is a movie that combines action and romance.
 Kenneth, you go.
 A name for a pocket microwave oven.
 That's neat.
 A little microwave oven.
 So it's kinda like a funcooker.
 The Funcooker! It's snappy, fresh, and incapable of offending.
 Get legal on the phone.
 I owe you one.
 One hug, you mean? They're reading Mr.
 Jordan's apology if you want to watch it.
 "I regret any pain my words and actions may have caused.
 "I apologize to my family, my fans, "and the American public.
 "Peace and love, Tracy Jordan.
" A heartfelt apology from a comedy icon.
 And we'll be right back.
 I do not apologize, America.
 I didn't even write that apology.
 I am advertiser Tracy Jordan, and I approve this message.
 I am an advertiser.
 I am an advertiser.
 Is that 30 seconds yet? Doesn't matter.
 We have The Funcooker.
 Hi, it's Liz.
 I should be able to get up there in an hour.
 Where are you rushing off to? Work? Not me.
 I'm gonna have a sandwich in my cell and take a nap.
 This man opens doors for me.
 I'm free.
 I'm freer than you.
 Freer than you.
 Professor Bananas is dead.
 Look, I know we're fighting, but I need to borrow your car.
 30 seconds.
 How are you feeling? Great.
 Alert.
 Is your vision steadily narrowing down to a pinpoint as if darkness is closing in on you? No, ma'am.
 Cast is set for robot/bear talk show.
 I'm back.
 What's going on? What have they done? Do we need to shut this down? Calm down.
 Everything's going to work out just fine.
 The show's about to begin, your sketch is adequate, and I've got The Funcooker.
 What about the It's the bear and robot talk show.
 Jenna needs to sleep, or she's going to die! Which one of you is Jenna? Go to sleep! Sleep, Jenna! Sleep! It's for your own good.
 Don't fight me.
 Sleep or die! Hey, America.
 Come on Tracy.
 Please cover for them.
 Check out my funcooker.
 Did he just say funcooker? That's where I've heard that.
 Go to commercial! Go to commercial! Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan.
 My wife's throwing away some of our old towels.
 Do you want them? Cause they're out by the trashcans.
 Now that's got to be 30 seconds.
 Nine? Here comes the funcooker.
 I'll be with you in a minute.
 Could we get some diet slice and pita chips up in here? Bitenuker! Right? I'll be there with pants on.
 You're the best.
 Hi, girlfriend.
 Let's go out this weekend and talk about you.
 All I did was ask for a diet slice and some pita chips.
 Nice try.
 Now it's my turn.
 They're all terrified of you.
 That'll get you a week of good behavior.
 My containers.
 My new beginning.
 We've both had a rough week.
 You went firebug, and I'm sitting on four million mini-microwaves that legal won't let out of the warehouse.
 I suggest we both go to our respective homes, open a bottle of wine, and heat up some ham in the shower.
 It works in the shower? You know what? This really is the best day ever.
 Here comes the funcooker!   

                




                    			I'm gonna duck uptown and have lunch with my boyfriend.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Is that code for some kind of older gal medical procedure? No, I really have a boyfriend.
 Look, he's handsome and a doctor.
 A doctor? Well, don't get too attached.
 As soon as people realize his tonics don't work, it's on to the next town.
 You know what I have a craving for? Jerk chicken from that place in Mill Basin? And some? Catalog photos of expectant mothers in their swimming suits? You are my radar O'Reilly.
 Now get in here and rub my feet till you hear a chopper coming.
 How's Tracy? What's his mood? Upbeat and confused.
 Perfect.
 You know his contract is up.
 Has it been that long? We sure have done some crazy things with Tracy in the last three years.
 We sure have.
 I'm thinking about some of them now.
 Me too.
 Anyway, I'm handling the Tracy thing myself.
 Right.
 Play hardball.
 Get your business jollies.
 Sadly enough this time, with Tracy, it's not about money anymore.
 His video game made a fortune and he invested all of it in a company that dismantles bank signs.
 They're doing very well.
 You don't think he's gonna leave? Don't worry.
 When you're above money, personal relationships become your currency.
 Tracy and I have become quite close.
 Look.
 We got BFF bracelets.
 You guys are best friends forever? That's not what that stands for.
 Why would you celebrate that? Tell me where you went to school again? Well I You really look nice today.
 Thank you.
 Do you know her? No, I don't think so.
 Wait! No! That's my car! Meter's expired.
 I forgot to get quarters.
 You know what? I got quarters.
 Thanks, officer.
 You're welcome.
 People sure are nice to you.
 I guess.
 Excuse me.
 I'm Calvin Klein and I think you should be my next underwear model.
 Well, thanks.
 You don't wanna get a card, phone number? Proofreading: So.
, Valpi.
 Episode 315: "The Bubble" You went to Plunder for lunch? How did you get a table? I don't know.
 It was packed.
 But they just gave Drew a table.
 It's ridiculous how people treat him.
 The chef sent over food.
 Ladies sent drinks.
 Mayer Bloomberg asked him to dance.
 Beautiful people are treated differently from moderately pleasant-looking people.
 It's true.
 They live in a bubble.
 A bubble of free drinks, kindness, and outdoor sex.
 How did Drew turn out as well as he did going through life like that? The bubble isn't always a bad thing.
 Look at me.
 I turned out OK, didn't I? I want you to pay close attention to the following over-the-top eye roll.
 Oh brother! I don't share this often.
 But this is a photo of me when I was 25 years old.
 What the what? You have a superman chest! I know.
 Oh, my god.
 The lady will have two tickets to the gun show.
 And your eyes are so much bluer.
 What happened to your eyes? My point is, the bubble doesn't last forever.
 So get in there with Drew and enjoy those perks while you can.
 Can I keep that? It's my only copy.
 Everyone gather around please.
 Actor announcement.
 As you probably know, especially if you read page six of my publicist's emails, I have decided to cut my hair and donate it to charity.
 But, why would you cut your beautiful hair? You look just how I picture Mary Magdalene.
 Because, I'm a selfless person who can't get arrested in this town.
 Meanwhile, Tracy's face is everywhere.
 I already explained that.
 That was a police sketch of a flasher who happened to look like Tracy We hope.
 Whatever.
 He's hogging the buzz.
 You've got buzz.
 You were in that magazine that time.
 I don't even know what you're referring to.
 And that was two years ago.
 As usual, I have to create my own opportunities.
 No one will be talking about Tracy Jordan this Friday when I cut my hair off on The Today Show.
 You're what I think Judas looks like.
 I hope you know how much we value you here at TGS.
 I like to think of this staff as a family.
 This is better than a family.
 No one around here asks me for my damn bone marrow.
 Why don't we make this easy on ourselves and renew your existing contract with a 3% increase? Sorry it took me so long to answer.
 I was just thinking about how weird it is that we eat birds.
 All right, we have a deal.
 You see how easy negotiating can be when it's not really about money.
 How's this really not about money? Obviously you don't need to work.
 What's that now, Charles? I'm just saying you made $300 million last year, so there's no financial need for you to continue with the show, but I never thought of it like that.
 Thank you.
 I quit.
 Goodbye.
 Had he really not put that together? Tracy's is a tactile kinesthetic learning style.
 So help me god It's nice of those guys to give up their court for us.
 Yes, for us.
 So I should probably warn you I was pro in college.
 What? I started teaching kids at the Y and then all their mothers wanted to take private lessons from me.
 But I promise I'll take it easy on you.
 It's been a long time since college? What do you mean? Excuse me.
 Do you give lessons? Now what is this? Dr.
 Drew's salmon bourguignon.
 What is this orangey taste? Gatorade.
 That was awesome.
 Are you choking? I'm a doctor.
 Stay calm.
 I just need to shake it loose.
 Don't panic.
 I just need something to push it down with.
 Do you have a chopstick or a fireplace match or something? There you go.
 Jack, there you are.
 I need to talk to you about something.
 The Tracy deal is a process.
 We are in process.
 Something happened with Drew.
 He's not a BFF? No! Never.
 It's the bubble.
 He is a doctor who doesn't know the Heimlich maneuver.
 He can't play tennis.
 He can't cook.
 He's as bad at sex as I am.
 But he has no idea.
 That is the danger of being super handsome.
 When you're in the bubble, nobody tells you the truth.
 For years I thought I spoke excellent French.
 Drew deserves to be told the truth.
 He's a good person who is a victim of our nation's obscene cult of superficiality.
 Did you tell him that he was no good in tennis? No, I let him win cause I wanted to make out with him in the cab.
 It's not fair to let Drew live a lie.
 And I think I'm the woman to fix him.
 Be careful.
 You wake a sleepwalker, you risk getting urinated on.
 Or thanked on.
 Mr.
 Jordan quit.
 What? I thought you were in process.
 Tracy's taking a strong position right now in the negotiation.
 It's not unheard of for him to stay home while I formulate my counter-proposal.
 What if it doesn't work? What if he doesn't come back? When I get upset my accent come out! And when it gets to comin' out I can't get to talkin' I have a show on Friday.
 It will be rectified.
 I didn't mean to upset you.
 Mr.
 Donaghy told us not to tell you but I couldn't hold it in anymore.
 Wait a minute.
 Are you hiding your screw-up from me? Don't cling to this.
 Be a manager.
 Control your people.
 Buy better clothes.
 I'm allowing this because I made a misstep.
 I'm handling it.
 And Tracy will be here by Friday night.
 Just get it done.
 Nope, I lost it.
 That was Batman.
 Thank you team Jenna for being here.
 Obviously my Today Show charity haircut is just the first step in my reinvention.
 This is serial killer language.
 My mother's boyfriend raised me to believe that a woman's hair is her crowning glory.
 A haircut can make or break a career.
 Before the Rachel, Jennifer Aniston was just a chunky nobody who couldn't get a job.
 Wasn't she already on Friends? Richard Esposito, move to the back.
 If I make the wrong choice, I could end up like Keri Russell, Felicity, season 2.
 Let's brainstorm.
 Everyone shout out words that describe my beauty.
 Fading.
 '80s.
 You needed me? You know Rick from accounting? I don't.
 Hi.
 Hi, nice to meet you.
 I have arrange for one of Tracy's childhood idols to reach out to him.
 Hello? Tracy, this is Jack.
 I have someone here who wants to speak with you.
 This is Bill Cosby.
 Really? This is your strategy? I heard him do this at a party.
 I want you to come back to the TGS for the people who like the jokes and the things.
 Bill Cosby, you got a lot of nerve getting on the phone with me after what you did to my aunt Paulette! I think you're confusing me with someone else.
 1971, Cincinnati.
 She was the cocktail waitress with the droopy eye.
 I'm the guy with the pudding Try to tell me what to do? Dr.
 Heathcliff Huxtable with your light-ass kids.
 Why would you make me talk to this man? Don't hang up.
 Tracy, this is Billy Dee Williams.
 I just wanna say I love your work.
 It's very smooth.
 Sorry I'm late.
 Why are you waiting here? I put our name in but it's gonna be a 45 minute wait.
 What? I'll go talk to the hostess.
 I wanna show you something.
 We're going to wait for the table.
 I hate this.
 This is gonna be unpleasant.
 As Tracy's family and inner circle, I wanted to enlist your help.
 While I'm sure all of you treasure him being home more I'm sorry.
 You want our help with your problem? You need to get our father back to work.
 That's what I'm trying to do.
 You wanna see what he packed me for lunch today? Mayonnaise And a pack of cigarettes.
 That is unfortunate.
 He set up a home recording studio in our rec room.
 My girl has a fat neck I'm sharp.
 Let's do it again.
 Thanks to you, I now have an unemployed father.
 You trying to make a stereotype out of me? Did you even vote for Obama? We've heard from Tracy junior.
 Where is your mother? Gone to take a spa week at Canyon Ranch before my dad broke it in half.
 What's that supposed to mean? I should not have to hear that.
 I'm a child! Tracy junior, George Foreman, I want to get your father back to work just as much as you do.
 But what do I offer the man who has everything? I don't know what to do.
 I didn't come here to hear more excuses.
 I'm here to see the dumbest cracker in all of New York.
 You gotta fix this, Donaghy.
 Fix this! You know I don't see it on the menu but I would love a catfish po'boy and a diet raspberry Fanta.
 That is a great idea.
 Let me order that for you.
 Excuse me.
 We will have a turkeyburger deluxe and a catfish po'boy with a diet raspberry Fanta.
 I'm gonna come back in five minutes you try to order off the menu again I will smack those glasses off your face.
 Thank you.
 You're welcome.
 What was that? Why didn't she call you "sweetheart"? And where's the complimentary app sampler? What's going on? This is how most people live.
 See, because of your whole, you know, Disney prince thing Actually they used footage of me from high school swim team to draw prince Eric.
 Right, because of that you live in a bubble where people do what you want and tell you what you wanna hear.
 I don't think that's true.
 I'm gonna tell you for your own good.
 You can't put Gatorade on salmon.
 Yes, you can.
 The hot Italian lady from the food network told me so.
 Did she say it on TV? She said it to me when she jumped escalators to try to talk to I don't wanna live that way.
 I don't want you to treat me that way.
 Are you sure? I'm an adult.
 You can be honest with me.
 I can take it.
 That's game.
 Your serve.
 That's it! I quit! This racquet is a fart and you cheat! You're a cheating bitch! I need your help.
 You know Tracy quite well, wouldn't you say? I know Mr.
 Jordan like the back of my stepfather Ron's hand.
 I know all his ATM pin codes.
 I know when he's cranky and needs his binky.
 I know that by binky he means 1970s pornography.
 So how is he functioning without you? I'm still doing everything for him.
 Tonight I have to ride my bike over to his house in New Jersey to hold his hand during Lost.
 That's it, don't you see? You're our ace in the hole.
 How dare you! You're what I've been looking for.
 The one thing at TGS that Tracy cannot live without.
 Now, I need you to cut Tracy off completely.
 I don't know if I could do that.
 You want him to come back, don't you? This is the only way.
 Don't answer that.
 It could be Tracy.
 But I have to answer the phones.
 That's my job.
 Hello.
 Studio 6H.
 This is Cranston.
 Hey Cranston, I was looking for Kenneth.
 He's not here.
 But I'm sure wherever he is, he loves you very much.
 You seem really stressed out.
 You wanna talk about what's going on? I just hope it's not a mistake.
 Maybe it is.
 But you have to listen to your heart.
 But why meddle with something that was great? It'll grow back.
 What? We're talking about my hair, right? Fat neck girl Let me count your neck rings I'm thirsty! Family! Who's in charge of my thirst? Why hasn't Kenneth called me back yet? I miss him.
 Why are you crying? This is too hard, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I cannot stand by while Mr.
 Jordan dies of dehydration in his recording studio.
 Plus, I've started to dream as Cranston.
 The more desperate Tracy becomes the more our plan is working.
 Next thing he'll do is show up here.
 He'll demand you go with.
 You say no.
 Stay strong and he'll cave.
 Trust me.
 I hope your right.
 Because you're playing with people's lives here.
 Don't you think I know that? We are back with sketch comedian Jenna Maroney.
 Thank you, Meredith.
 But please, I'm not a hero.
 Just trying to raise awareness that I'm more than that hot chick on Tracy Jordan's show.
 So this is for Locks of Love? Locks of Love turned me down.
 They said my hair was too processed for a sick person to wear.
 But this is for a wonderful charity called Merkins of Hope.
 Let's make the big cut.
 So what about that crazy news that Tracy Jordan has quit TGS? What? Word is he quit over a contract dispute.
 Guess you're the only star left on that show.
 Stop cutting my hair! I don't need this anymore! It's OK.
 It's OK.
 I can fix this.
 Is Tracy still not here? We have 3 hours before the show.
 Security told me that he's in the building, so it's working.
 Now it's all up to Kenneth Ellen Parcell.
 I've been calling you.
 Has Cranston not been giving you my messages? He told me.
 Well don't worry.
 Just came to get a few of my things.
 Then I won't bother you.
 All right, I guess that's everything.
 But I want you to know if I walk out that door, I'm not gonna call again.
 It's over.
 You understand? I can't do this.
 I'm sorry, but I can't.
 Mr.
 Donaghy wanted me to stop talking to you so you'd come back.
 So you used Cranston as his gatekeeper.
 I'm very disappointed.
 I know, I blew it.
 I guess I'm only farm strong and not heart strong.
 Fine.
 Go and help him.
 I shouldn't have tried to manipulate the two of you that way.
 But I will need you to turn in your page jacket.
 What? Your main duty was taking care of Tracy.
 He no longer works here.
 Therefore your services are no longer required.
 As a page? Wait a minute.
 You want to fire my boy Ken? Stay out of this.
 It's not your concern.
 Unless.
 Unless what? You said Kenneth can't work here because I don't work here.
 But if I work here, so can Kenneth.
 I don't understand.
 Of course you don't, you idiot.
 I'm coming back to work! With Kenneth! Damn you and your meddling.
 I'll be in my dressing room.
 Atta boy.
 Come on.
 I've gotta get back into that bubble.
 Sir, you are pulling that look off.
 I wanted to apologize for my behavior the other day on the tennis court.
 That is not who I am.
 But you made me feel like a loser Cause you lost.
 Maybe I shouldn't have done that to you, but you have so much potential.
 But I'm happy this way.
 I didn't like it outside the bubble.
 It was very ironic.
 No, it wasn't.
 That's not how you use that word Stop it.
 I wanna use ironic however I want.
 I wanna stay in the bubble.
 And I want you in there with me.
 Come on.
 Come away with me.
 We can go upstate on my new motorcycle.
 I don't think this is going to work.
 I guess I'll see you around then.
 Or as the french say, I'll see you around.
   

                




                    			Good morning.
 What is that sound? Are you frying bacon? No, it's my new running shoes.
 Come on.
 I'm going over the guest list for my 50th birthday party and you haven't RSVPed.
 Right.
 Sorry.
 My mail's been piling up.
 And I keep forgetting to buy toilet paper, so.
 What does that mean? Nothing, I'm coming.
 Don't wear that thing with a belt.
 What thing with a belt? Don't hang up.
 I have a lot of belts that What is this idiot doing? I will be brief.
 I have decided to fulfill my dream of going into space.
 If you have a spaceship and are looking for a hilarious astronaut with an irregular heartbeat and thirty million dollars I'm prepared to leave as soon as tomorrow.
 I wrote that yesterday.
 I will not be taking questions.
 Hello, dummy! Nope, not interested.
 Have a good life.
 It's important.
 It's about my mom.
 That was a lie.
 But listen, I recently discovered that I'm a sex addict.
 No, you're not.
 I'd be an even worse addict if I wasn't consumed by my latest business adventure.
 Don't wanna hear about your job.
 One word.
 Coffee.
 One problem.
 Where do you get it? Anywhere, you get it anywhere.
 Wrong.
 You get it at my coffee vending machine.
 in the basement at K-mart.
 You just go downstairs.
 You get the key from David.
 And boom, you plug-in the machine.
 You're done.
 But the point is I'm Dennis.
 And I'm a sex addict.
 And one of the steps towards my recovery is atonement.
 Please, stop talking.
 Former sex partner, I'm sorry that my disease has made you a victim of my sexual charisma.
 Sorry I've ruined you for other men.
 Apology accepted.
 Now get out of my apartment.
 You know, my sponsor said you were gonna try to pick a fight to lure me into hit sex.
 It's not gonna work.
 My support group, it's lousy with nymphos.
 Proofreading: So.
, Valpi Episode 316: "Apollo, Apollo" Have you seen this Tracy thing? I am aware of it.
 I have a Google news alert for the phrase, "Tracy Jordan ridiculous disaster.
" Have you spoken to him? We're with his assistant, setting up a time for us to talk.
 Well, when do you expect him? I think he has stuff all morning.
 You think or you know? Hang on.
 I'm going into a tunnel.
 What is this? My mother sent me a box of old Donaghy home movies.
 For your birthday? That's sweet.
 No, not really.
 This is the card that came with it.
 "Jackie, here is some of your junk.
 "It was taking up the space my new boyfriend needed for his golf bags.
 "His name is Paul and he doesn't want to meet you.
" At any rate, I had Jonathan convert the movies to DVD, to preserve these memories forever.
 Oh, my God.
 Is that you? I like your little sweater vest.
 You threw up? What? As a kid you never got so excited you vomited? No one does that.
 I mean, I've peed a little.
 Help me! His tie caught in the shredder! I'm lizzing! I'm lizzing! "Lizzing" is a combination of laughing and whizzing.
 If you want a good lizz, read this.
 What is it? A list I made in the 5th grade of what I wanted to have done by the time I turned 50.
 Oh, my God.
 This is adorable.
 "Go to Disneyland.
 Ride in an airplane.
 "Kiss Peggy Fleming.
" Done, done, and Boy.
 Done.
 "Live in a house with stairs.
 Beat up a Russian.
 "Hit mom with a car.
" I wonder what that ten year old would think If he could see himself now.
 "Fly on a plane.
" I've flown on Air Force One.
 "Go to Disneyland.
" I've held Walt Disney's frozen head in my hands.
 That's awesome.
 I've danced with Queen Noor.
 I've hunted the world's most dangerous game Man.
 Excuse me.
 Manatee.
 I once shot a manatee.
 If that kid could see himself today, he would throw up.
 There's only one left.
 "Be friends "with Batman.
" There's still a couple of hours.
 Could you get Adam West's agent on the phone, please.
 Griswald talent management.
 Representing excellence.
 It's funny.
 I actually played Peter Pan on Broadway.
 Did you know there's a Broadway street in Tampa? This is important.
 This needs to be threaded all the way up.
 Otherwise you could fall.
 In bed.
 Pay attention.
 You can't have anything in your pockets.
 My phone.
 Will you hold that? Thanks.
 Ready.
 I'm flying! Oh, my God.
 Why are there so many dead doves up here? Jenna's phone.
 Hey, Jenna.
 This is Dennis Duffy.
 Yes, hello, this is Jenna.
 You never thought you'd be hearing from me again.
 Yes, really.
 Why so ever would you be phoning me? With the help of WebMD I was recently self-diagnosed as a sex addict.
 So former sex partner, I'm sorry that my disease made you a victim of my sexual charisma.
 I'm sorry that I ruined you for other men.
 I would've come down there and done this in person.
 But it's complicated because of the whole Liz thing.
 Naturally.
 Liz.
 Always.
 If she found out she couldn't handle it.
 And it would ruin your friendship.
 You know, I was the love of Liz's life.
 I'm not sure you were but apology accepted.
 I totally was.
 Peace.
 Forget it, Tracy.
 Tracy, listen.
 You cannot go into space.
 Your contract expressly prohibits dangerous activities.
 Like extreme sports or riding the subway on St.
 Patrick's Day.
 What is this? Horseville? 'Cause I am surrounded by naysayers! Wordplay.
 That is solid.
 When I was a kid growing up in the projects, I would look up at the stars and dream of going into space.
 Of escaping the slums.
 Of killing an Ewok! Now the man that that kid has become can make those dreams come true.
 Do you know what that's like? I do.
 Then you know why I have to do this.
 As Robert Browning once wrote, "But a man's reach should exceed his grasp.
 "Or what is a heaven for?" I was prepared for the possibility of this meeting.
 I'll call up my friends at NASA and I'll set up a flight for you.
 Thank you, Jackie D.
 Jack, what the hell? I'm not taking his childhood dream away from him.
 Not on my birthday.
 So you're just gonna let him do this? Of course not.
 I don't have friends at NASA.
 Bunch of nerds.
 You're gonna have to use your TV magic and fake a space launch for Tracy.
 I was gonna go for a run today! You missed a call.
 Was it my doctor/trainer? It was Dennis.
 Calling me? Why? Dennis has been going around calling all the women he's ever had sex with.
 Did you speak to him? Did you pretend to be me? Did you do an impression of me? Was it British? First of all, the reason I have some English inflection in my speech is because I lost my virginity to the My fair Lady soundtrack.
 Second, you guys had broken up and Dennis and I were in a very emotional place because of hurricane Katrina.
 What you did was disgusting.
 But how long have we known each other? 15 years.
 We met at that car dealership audition in Chicago.
 You were trying to be an actress then, despite your neck.
 We have both seen this happen too many times.
 A strong female friendship torn apart by some guy.
 That's not what's gonna happen.
 Dennis Duffy said he didn't want this to hurt our friendship.
 As if someone like him ever could.
 The idea that that guy is walking around thinking he means anything to me, to either of us, it's ridiculous.
 It's unacceptable.
 He shouldn't get away with it.
 Are you thinking the same? Let's stab him.
 Let's give him a piece of our mind.
 Your thing.
 More gifts, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 You got a new tuxedo for your party.
 You know, I wore nothing but hand-me-downs until I was 12 years old.
 But I thought you were the oldest.
 Oldest boy.
 Now look at me.
 I already did.
 That's a lot of loot.
 My last birthday, I cleaned up.
 Look at this keychain I got.
 Every time you move his head, his head moves.
 Look! I wonder what it's like seeing the world through your eyes.
 I don't know.
 I think I see the world pretty much the same as everyone else.
 Really? 'Cause I think you're very special, Kenneth Pardon me.
  to be able to get so much joy from simple things.
 Simple Things.
 But most of us grow up and lose our sense of wonder.
 That's sad.
 Not really.
 I've surpassed my wildest dreams.
 I'm happier than I've ever been.
 Of course you are.
 You've got all these fancy presents from business associates and this big empty house to store them in.
 Happy birthday, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Hello, dummy.
 What's up? I know about you and Jenna.
 I get why you're here.
 You want me to rank you.
 Apples and oranges, ladies.
 Stop.
 Shut up.
 I'm here because I want you to know that I am not mad at Jenna about this.
 You can't be mad at me either.
 I went to your apartment that night looking for you.
 To be with you.
 Wait a minute, hang on.
 My apartment? I can explain that.
 You had gone on that over 30 outward bound trip to Arizona.
 You had asked me to housesit.
 Dennis came over.
 And as I mentioned, we were both pretty torn up about hurricane Katrina.
 What those people were doing to the Superdome.
 Fine.
 You know what, it happened.
 What do you want from me? This is what I want from you.
 I want you to understand exactly how unimportant you are.
 You are not the love of my life.
 You are not capable of hurting me.
 And you could never do anything to damage this friendship.
 It was in your bed.
 Guys, come on! I eat in there.
 I'm gonna take the high road.
 So good luck with your fake addiction and your inconveniently-located vending machine.
 Not okay, Liz.
 Not okay.
 All right, fine.
 You know what? I'm ranking you now.
 Hey, blondie, you're number one.
 Thank you.
 I don't care.
 You got it.
 Ladies and gentlemen, I can't stay long.
 I'm on a case.
 The Penguin's in town.
 But I would like to introduce my good friend.
 The man of the hour.
 Jake Delahey! This is wrong.
 It's all wrong.
 Everyone go home now.
 The party's over.
 I was told I'd get a meal.
 Fine Why don't you just Am I the first one here? I waited.
 This always happens.
 Lemon, what's inside that box? I don't know.
 A toy? Tonight was supposed to be special.
 And all I could think about was that kid.
 So happy, he threw up.
 The closest I came to vomiting was when I saw Ann Coulter's shoulder blades.
 What happens to us? We grow up.
 I have a good life, but I'll never be that happy again.
 I want that back.
 There's nothing you can do about that.
 I disagree.
 I'm going to find out what was inside that box, to buy it with money.
 And it's going to make me happy.
 If that doesn't work, I'm going to Benjamin Button myself.
 We're not meeting in the middle.
 I just wanted to get you to approve the other astronauts we hired.
 Looks good.
 Where's Tracy? In Cape Canaveral.
 By which I mean through that door.
 We told him he had to beblindfolded before launch to prevent space madness.
 And then we put him on the Channel 4 traffic copter.
 And now he's landed here in sunny Florida.
 Well done, Hornberger.
 As a child, I dreamed of being a congressman like my father.
 Now I do this.
 One DUI in high school.
 At least it's a dry heat here in Florida.
 Good work astronaut Jordan.
 Now, do 20 space sit-ups.
 Computer, when do I get some tang? Also, I'm thirsty.
 Wordplay.
 Morning, Jenna.
 Hey, you.
 God, telling Dennis off together was so empowering.
 I felt so jacked up on the way home I threw a brick through the window of a Banana Republic.
 Yeah, it was something.
 I can't believe Dennis tried to do that to us.
 But he got his, right? Sisterhood.
 Sure.
 Sisterhood! Nothing.
 Be careful, 'cause that thing is open.
 I'll go get the Emergency Floor Marshall.
 Floor Marshall! You called tech support? I need to see what's inside that box.
 If I learned anything from watching 24, you're gonna want to zoom in and enhance.
 Why don't you ask Jimmy what's in there? It says "from Jimmy" on it.
 Jimmy Flaherty.
 What did you get me for my tenth birthday? I thought this was a job interview.
 I flew down from Boston.
 I have to know.
 I need to know what you got me that made me that happy.
 I don't remember.
 Doesn't it have any sound on it? You're clearly saying something.
 Get me a deaf person.
 I was told this was a job interview.
 Tell me, Wendy.
 What am I saying? You're saying "Apollo.
" Oh, my God! You puked! Why wouldn't you warn me? I'm staring at your mouth! I know what it is! Sista! How's the leg? You are a piece of work.
 These crutches are real, everyone.
 Liz tried to kill me.
 What are you talking about? Please, you saw the harness and you didn't do anything.
 T-minus ten minutes.
 Be quiet.
 Tracy's coming.
 All systems are go for launch.
 Star Wars.
 All that stuff about our friendship was a lie.
 You would've let me die, Liz, over Dennis Duffy.
 So OK, I did a bad thing.
 But you slept with Dennis.
 And now we're even? Even? I can't even look at you.
 You know what? You're no longer my plus one to the Canadian Grammys.
 Lift off.
 I'm scared, but I'm also excited! I'm lizzing! What is that? This is an Apollo command and lunar module that I just paid $7,000 for at a vintage toy store Where a morbidly obese gentleman called me "pal".
 Tracy to Earth.
 Come in, Earth! How is space? Great wink.
 Space is very cold but very beautiful.
 And sometimes it sounds like Jenna yelling in the distance.
 I think I Where did you get that rocket? Mr.
 Donaghy's letting me hold it.
 It's awesome.
 You know, I actually envy you two.
 Sometimes I wish I could see the world through your eyes instead of mine.
 If everyone could see the world the way I see it it would be a better place to live.
 I bet that's true, Tracy.
 But that part of me is gone forever.
 I guess I just see the world the way I see it.
 Is he letting me keep this? I think so.
 I wish I was there so I could play with it.
 What do you want? I want to make it up to you.
 What can I do? How about on the next show you could do that song that they wouldn't let you sing at the inauguration? "Chocolate Rainbow" is too good for TGS.
 You can tell them.
 You can tell the writers.
 Tell them what? About my commercial.
 The one I was in back in Chicago.
 You can tell them.
 Everyone, listen to me.
 It's a real thing this time.
 When we were living back in Chicago and Liz was still trying to be an actress, the only job she ever booked was for a local phone sex line.
 It was a chat line for urban singles.
 And they only hired her because their first choice was deported.
 We're even.
 So You will not find it I found it, it's on Youtube.
 I have a cable to hook the computer.
 Then shut your wet mouth and get it.
 Come on, guys.
 Let's all be cool.
 That's not gonna Don't wait, call now.
 How did you do that so fast? Hi, I'm Bijou.
 Bijou! Call me.
 I have since had invisalign.
 That is not attractive.
 Call us.
 In English, German, or Polish.
 That's not even enough numbers.
 21 hours a day.
 What is this? A commercial Liz did back in Chicago.
 That's Liz.
 Call us.
 We love to party.
 I remember that girl.
 She cried all day.
 This is not happening! What's so funny? Is that Billie Jean King? I haven't laughed this much since Everybody back up.
 Get out of the way! He's gonna Jack! Goodness gracious! He's mortal! What just happened? Hey, are you feeling okay? I feel great.
 I feel like a kid.
 I honestly don't know what I would do without you.
 I'll see you tomorrow.
 See you tomorrow Bijou.
   

                




                    			OK, guys, I just want to say congratulations on our 50th show! That's 50 hours of comedy, over 300 sketches, one unsolved crew death, and an Emmy magazine cover story.
 And someone got us booze gifts.
 Sweet.
 They're all empty.
 Congratulations on 50 shows, everyone.
 Enjoy your decorative air holders.
 You deserve them.
 A word.
 It's a pretty lame present.
 Cutbacks.
 Our parent company Sheinhardt Wigs is announcing losses for the first time since the civil war.
 And even I am not immune.
 I had to let Jonathan go today.
 My god.
 How did he take it? Better than I expected.
 Can't live If living is without you OK, last verse.
 I can't live The entertainment division is gonna come under some very close scrutiny.
 The days of your wild coke parties are over.
 If by "coke", you mean "sodas" I do.
 It's really bad.
 It's so bad, the Sheinhardts are hiring an outside consulting firm.
 They're bringing in hatchet men to trim the fat.
 And on Monday, you will have to present and justify your budget to them.
 Can you handle that? Handle a presentation? I put on a live show every week unless there's wrestling.
 I'm on it.
 Good.
 I've got some more downsizing to do upstairs so I've got no time for hand-holding.
 Let's get this right.
 I've got so tricks up my sleeve.
 That's my girl.
 No, Trix, the cereal.
 Some fell in my sleeve.
 It's sticking to the fibers.
 Proofreading: So.
, Valpi Episode 317: "Cutbacks" You wanted to see me.
 As you may have heard, Jonathan no longer works here.
 The assistants talked about it at Finnegan's, the bar we all go to after work in my dreams.
 Obviously, I'm going to need an assistant.
 And I'm going to have to ask you to fill in.
 But what about my page duties? I've taken care of that.
 You'll do both jobs.
 This is a very difficult time.
 I'm gonna be counting on you.
 You'll do fine so long as you follow my three D: discretion, docility, and don't use my bathroom.
 Mr.
 Donaghy's office.
 This is Kenneth.
 How may I help you? It's Greg Windham from Aviation.
 I'm not here.
 But you are here.
 I can see you.
 I don't want to talk to him.
 Corporate intrigue.
 He's not in right now.
 I'll tell him you called.
 I feel like I'm in The Pelican Brief! Do I already know too much? Brad Halster.
 The Himler group.
 A division of Advantrix Consulting.
 My associate, Peter Hornberger.
 Is there a conference room where we can sit down and get started? I thought we'd do this outside the box.
 I'd like to tell you about three television programs.
 A comedy show, a musical variety show, and a live television event.
 Comedy, music show, live show.
 Comedy, music, live.
 Are you getting it? They're all the same show.
 They're all TGS.
 Now I could stand here, and I could bore you with numbers.
 I could tell you that we are the number one late night show among men 9-13 and the morbidly obese.
 I could tell you that we're in final negotiations to create exclusive content for America's jails.
 But I'm not the one being judged here.
 So I thought I'd let the show speak for herself.
 Dessert! Someone put too many farts in this engine.
 It's about to explode! I'm Flavor Obama and I'd like to introduce the Under Secretary of Housing and crystal meth, boy! It's "The Bear and Robot Talk Show!" My name is Suri Cruise Put your hands in the air I came out of the womb with a full head of hair It's farting! That's our show for tonight.
 See you next week! This is TGS! So where's that conference room? Golly.
 I am sorry, Mr.
 Jordan.
 I'm just overworked.
 With my page duties and being Mr.
 Donaghy's assistant, there's not enough hours in the day.
 I'm sorry about that.
 But just let me know if there's any way I can help.
 Actually, there is one thing.
 I was just saying that.
 Why can't you read human facial ques? What is it? With both these jobs, I don't know when I'm gonna be able to get home.
 I'm worried about my bird, Sonny Crockett.
 Would you mind going to my apartment and feeding him? Birds are like little dinosaurs.
 So what I'll be doing is actually pretty cool and brave.
 Thank you, sir.
 Here are my keys.
 And one thing, don't go into my bedroom.
 What? Do not go into my bedroom.
 to cut a quarter of our budget? Well, there is some fat.
 What about Sid? I can't fire our announcer.
 He'll lose his insurance.
 He has health problems.
 Because he was hit by lightning and can't really talk anymore.
 It's Tergis with Tracky Jong-Jong and Jimmy Moop! Sid is off the table.
 I'm not firing any of my people.
 I'm not doing that to their families.
 Or for Sid, their much younger wife with whom they have an open relationship.
 We'll find the money somewhere else.
 The food budget What about straws? We spend $1,200 a year on straws.
 OK, fine.
 No more straws.
 Everyone drinks from the can from now on.
 We need straws.
 That's its bathroom! Listen, Liz, I'm gonna need your revised budget by the end of today.
 I don't know.
 TGS is a complicated machine.
 Every part's important.
 I get it.
 You don't want to be the bad guy.
 But if you don't make the cuts, I will.
 And I don't give a crap about anyone here.
 I know this isn't easy, but the company's facing cutbacks.
 And you have to admit your Boom Box Division is a little behind the times.
 We're not, we're groovy! I can offer you two weeks severance.
 I know you said only interrupt you if it was very important, but Tashonda from Time Warner Cable is on the phone and she's offering three free months of Showtime.
 But we have to act now.
 This does not qualify as something important.
 I do not want Showtime.
 Sorry.
 I didn't want you to miss out on this exciting opportunity Thank you, Kenneth.
 Take your time.
 Hey, little guy.
 Don't go in the bedroom.
 I wasn't going to! Are you here to see Kenneth the page or Kenneth the Mr.
 Donaghy's assistant? I need to see Jack.
 Mr.
 Donaghy is in an important meeting.
 And I'm being told not to interrupt him.
 What is this pertaining to? The TGS budget.
 Oh, my.
 That sounds very important.
 I've worked here 20 years.
 I was wrong.
 That was not important enough.
 It's me, Kenneth the page, this job is hard.
 Please have a seat.
 Mr.
 Donaghy will be right with you.
 Do you know wath these meetings are about? I hear people are getting fired.
 Yeah.
 I don't know.
 Do you know Jack Donaghy well? Pretty well.
 Do you know if he's a boob man or a butt man? What? Why would you ask that? Because I don't want to get fired.
 So I'm gonna have to go in there and boink my way out of this one.
 I'm Cheryl, by the way.
 You're gonna try to have sex with Jack? I have to.
 I have 15 employees.
 I'm responsible for them.
 Do you have any idea what that's like? I have 200 people under me, but Maybe we could team up, go in there together, lez out, give him a show.
 Get a grip.
 Mr.
 Donaghy will see you now.
 Make it quick.
 I'm in the middle of a very unpleasant day.
 So am I.
 I know this cutback is difficult.
 I don't want to fire anyone.
 And I don't want to take anything away from my crew.
 And I wanna keep making free, long-distance prank calls to people like Seattle's Richard Sacmuncher.
 And I think that's reasonable.
 So what do I do to get out of this? The only thing to do is make your cuts and live to fight another day.
 What? That's it? I thought you'd tell me to cook the numbers or shred something or do some Pelican brief stuff.
 Why is everyone talking about that movie? It's been playing on Showtime.
 Get me Showtime.
 Why now? I'm sorry.
 I know this is hard, but there's no way out of it.
 Well, little heads up, your next meeting might disagree.
 She's planning to change your mind by hitting that.
 No, not again.
 This last guy tried to take my belt off.
 The sad thing is, it sometimes works.
 Sexual bartering pays off.
 Salome.
 Mata Hari.
 Deborah Norville.
 Good luck downstairs.
 I'm sure you'll figure it out.
 And one more thing.
 Don't cut the straw budget 'cause I've already cut the exterminators.
 Something weird is going on.
 You mean this budget stuff? Don't worry about it.
 It's just gonna affect the non-specials.
 No, it's not that.
 You're the smartest person I know.
 You think Kenneth could be a murderer? What? Why would you think that? I might be crazy, but neither he nor his bird would let me into his bedroom.
 And why wouldn't you let Tracy Jordan into your bedroom unless you got a bunch of dead nurses in there? I had to study serial killers to prepare for my role as criminal profiler Jill St.
 Ferrari in the lifetime original miniseries Hushed rapings.
 And all masked murderers share three characteristics: cruelty to animals He grew up killing pigs! Bedwetting.
 No wonder he's fascinated when I do that! And an inability to read human facial ques! I admonished him for that earlier! Three for three.
 He's a monster! We've gotta go tell Jack.
 You know, if Kenneth is actually a killer, we're gonna be heroes.
 Our food is gone.
 They took it.
 It happened this morning.
 Do you have a cookie? Mommy's baby needs his yum-yums.
 Sid, did you get fired? Good-bye, Lerz.
 Liz, it's a massacre! What is going on? Brad came in and started making cuts.
 I can't go back to teaching high school math.
 Girls pretend they're not women, but they are.
 Do something.
 You're our only hope.
 You look hot in those trousers.
 How about we grab drinks tonight? Update my sched.
 Good morning, sir.
 I know there's a learning curve here, but I need you to focus.
 No mistakes now.
 Think before you speak.
 Understand? Where's Jonathan? Jonathan's not here anymore.
 How may I help you? We need to see Jack.
 I don't know if I can allow that.
 I've made some mistakes lately.
 Terrible mistakes.
 I need to know what this is about.
 I can't have you getting me into trouble.
 It's not about you.
 Yeah, it's about someone else.
 I'm afraid this guy I know in Canada might be a serial killer.
 And what is his name? I mean I'll tell you his name.
 It's Kenneth.
 Excellent.
 I will be sure to let him know as soon as he's done firing Steven Lee from Microwaves.
 Mr.
 Lee, I forgot.
 He's ready for you now.
 I've got chills.
 He's evil.
 If I had any doubts about this before, and I don't think I did, they're gone now.
 We gotta go to his apartment and save who we can.
 We're definitely gonna be heroes.
 Like Julia and Denzel in The Pelican Brief! Lee, I need that dress Jenna wore for the hooker sketch, the heels Tracy wears when he plays Michelle Obama, and double Wait Triple Spanx.
 I need a makeup artist! The sluttier one.
 Thanks, Liz.
 You're our hero.
 They may take my dignity, but they will never take our straws! Why a rolled up towel is against the bottom of the door? It's so creepy! I just want you to know that if we find any human remains in there, I'm gonna throw up all over our face.
 Kenneth's a murderer and the Riddler's coming! It's a bug bomb.
 Get out.
 It's poisonous.
 Thanks for dinner.
 You sure know a lot about sushi.
 You gotta be careful.
 They try to up-sell you the real crab.
 Listen, I gotta get going.
 I got a lotta work tomorrow.
 All right, listen, we're both adults.
 We know the deal.
 Let's cut to the chase.
 That's certainly direct.
 We go upstairs.
 20 minutes.
 Open mouth.
 I will work your ears.
 What you're asking me to do is a big deal.
 If I go through, I need to know it's worth this.
 Fine.
 30 minutes.
 I'll make some sounds.
 And you can say one weird thing to me.
 Hardball.
 30 minutes.
 Sounds.
 Top front of my body is now in play.
 Deal? Deal.
 I heard a rumor that you went out with one of the consultants last night.
 I had no choice.
 I had to give him a little taste of the lemon.
 And it was not sour, my friend.
 It's interesting you put it that way because your writers' room is now the headquarters for Telemundo's coverage of world cup soccer qualifying.
 What the what? Brad and I had a deal.
 I gave him top front.
 Top front? Good lord, Lemon, that's your worst quadrant.
 You know how you told Tracy not to go into your bedroom? We assumed you were a serial killer.
 And as you can imagine, your bird is dead.
 But on the bright side, you've been downgraded from "suspect" to "person of interest".
 Some day, we're gonna look back on this and laugh.
 Time does heal all wounds! Now, you wait just one minute.
 I am sorry to be using my barn voice in front of a lady, but I am riled up.
 It is not enough that you killed the bird I've had for almost 60 years.
 But the fact that you didn't trust me is unforgivable.
 But what should I expect? Look at you two walking around without a care in the world as budgets are slashed and people keep getting called into Mr.
 Donaghy's office to be fired.
 I may just be a non-special, but what you two did is inexcusable.
 Good day.
 I'm out of letters.
 I have to return my kids' braces.
 We trusted you! You ruined it with your talking.
 Why are you still messing with my show? What about last night? Last night was what it was, but business is business.
 Right.
 And last night, I gave you the business.
 We had an agreement.
 Top front and some light ear work! You got your quid, Halster.
 Where's my quo? Last night was about the show? You know it was.
 "It's gotta be worth it and what you're asking me to do is such a big deal.
" It was a big deal.
 Being with a woman for the first time since my wife died.
 Snap.
 It was just a transaction? What kind of person are you? Does it help if I tell you I thought we were doing sexual espionage? Sharon! Angel! I swore to you the next one would be worthy, but she's not! She's a monster! Add Dr.
 Walters to my sched.
 Let's go.
 So Mr.
 Halster has filed a complaint against you with human resources.
 Specifically, his claim suggests that you tried to barter sex in exchange for professional consideration.
 In the human resource world, we refer to that as "being a filthy prostitute".
 Since this is your first incident and Mr.
 Donaghy has explained the mitigating circumstances I'm convinced that this sexual outburst was brought on by menopause.
 We are recommending only a two-week suspension without pay.
 That's fair.
 Obviously Mr.
 Halster cannot function in this hostile work environment.
 His company has reassigned him.
 And your budget review process will start over again under my supervision.
 Really? Really.
 I hope you've learned your lesson, Miss lemon.
 When you harass sexually in the workplace, things do not somehow just work out in the end.
 I thought you'd like to know that there's a spider on the printer.
 Am I interrupting? Is this another firing meeting? It is now.
 Have a seat.
 We feel bad that we, but mostly Jenna, gassed your bird.
 I agree.
 Not to name names, but it's so sad that a certain black individual found it necessary to trick someone so pretty into believing you were a murderer.
 I'm sorry, is there a point to all this? I've had a bad couple of days.
 We feel terrible about what happened, so we did a little something to make it up to you.
 Looks like I've got some naming to do.
   

                




                    			You're all here because you've been suspended from work for sexual harassment.
 But through this seminar, you will learn the skills to keep you from making the same kinds of mistakes that got you here.
 Excuse me, Mr.
 Winerslav It's pronounced "weener-slave".
 OK, Jeffrey.
 Is there anything I can do to speed this process up so I can get back to work? I'm afraid not.
 But someone who's in a rush to get back to work? That's somethin' you don't see every day.
 That is an example of a very appropriate and very, very funny joke.
 Jenna, I need to speak with you.
 Jack, I did not hit that Asian page.
 I was just swinging my arm and she walked into me.
 Twice.
 It's not about that.
 It's about your Sheinhardt-Universal Japlin Joplin biopic.
 Wait.
 We can call her Japlin Joplin? We got the life rights? It's not Janie Jimplin anymore? Apparently, neither name cleared.
 It looks like your character's going to be called Jackie Jormp-Jomp.
 OK.
 So, what's the good news? I didn't say there was any.
 Universal did some focus testing this week.
 We got 100? You're holding that upsiddown.
 Yes.
 I was afraid of this.
 It turns out not having the life rights or any Japlin Joplin songs was a negative for audiences.
 What about my duet with Jimi Hendrickson at Woodstocks? We're all here at Woodstocks Someday there will be a black president Jenna, Sheinhardt-Universal does not wanna release the picture.
 How will that affect my Oscar chances? Adversely.
 Unless we get independent distribution.
 To do that, "Sing Dem Blues, White Girl: The Jackie Jormp-Jomp Story" has gotta get some buzz.
 I'm gonna need your help for that.
 Do you need a sex tape released? 'Cause I got a weird one.
 It's night vision and you can see that his buddy is robbing me.
 No, Jenna, I want you on the PR Warpath.
 If there's a red carpet, I want you on it talking up the movie starting Monday.
 The kids' choice awards? Fine.
 I'll set aside my feud with Raven Simone for one day.
 But she knows what she did.
 Proofreading: Valpi Episode 318: "Jackie Jormp-Jomp" You aren't supposed to be here.
 You're on s-e-x probation.
 I know, I just wanted to stop by and check in.
 Kenneth, stop.
 I just want a script or a rundown, OK? Put that down.
 You give that to me.
 Did you hear what I said? Mr.
 Donaghy, help! Rule breaking! This is sad.
 Come with me.
 Lemon, you know you're supposed to go home after your pervert seminars.
 I'm going.
 I just hate not being here.
 You have to rehearse! Passive resistance! I learned that from Dr.
 King! I'm brave! You sure you miss this? Yes.
 As crazy and stressful as this place is, not being here is worse.
 I feel for you.
 Remember when I came back from the Economic Forum with Mono and missed work I wanted to pull my hair out, I couldn't because it's too thick? We need the stress.
 We're only happy when we're overcoming obstacles.
 You take that away, we start bouncing off the walls, spend our days jabbering at doormen.
 Hey, I brighten their day.
 Before I go, can I at least find out what Frank's hat says? "Constant craving.
" He could do better.
 Has anyone looked at this sexual harassment stuff they gave us? I don't need to read it.
 The whole thing is loosely based on a evening I spent with Isiah Thomas.
 No wonder Liz got busted.
 According to this, you can't do anything without it being considered harassment.
 Did you know you have to report in-office relationships? Is that true? It's the first thing listed.
 Have you read this? Well, I wanted to, because it's full of rules, but Ms.
 Vieira made me throw it away.
 And said pretty boys like me shouldn't be filling their heads with ideas.
 Coworker.
 Ms.
 Vieira Of course my job is annoying, but that doesn't mean I don't love it.
 I'm sure your job can be annoying.
 Not all the tenants are as fun as me.
 I get it.
 Would you mind if I brought a chair down here? Yes, my job is stressful.
 Very stressful.
 But in the end, I get paid to make people laugh.
 We have a saying that laughter is the best medicine, so I'm kind of like a doctor here.
 Like you were, in Poland.
 We have a show tonight.
 I've never missed a show.
 Not even the time I had that virus they kept saying only raccoons get.
 I can't believe I'm not there.
 I've picked up some polish from you guys.
 It's kinda cold out for a jog.
 I'm just going to the fitness center.
 What? This building has a gym? Yeah, it's the door right next to the vending machines.
 Vending machines? What kind? I don't know, sorry.
 I'm Emily.
 Are you new to the building? No, I'm Liz.
 I've lived here for four years.
 I usually work crazy, long hours, but I'm on leave right now for normal reasons.
 And you're feeling a little lost.
 I am.
 Right now, I should be standing in a toilet stall so nobody bothers me while I eat lunch.
 God, I miss it.
 I was an investment banker for 15 years.
 corner office, secret candy drawer And a decoy candy drawer to throw others off the trail? Smart.
 The point is you get addicted to the stress.
 Think it gives your life purpose.
 And then when you stop For normal reasons you see how stupid you were.
 It just takes time to realize there are much better ways to be happy.
 Wait for me lady.
 What can I do for ya? I recently learned that company policy requires that employees discolose their relationships with their coworkers to their immediate supervisor.
 I am not your immediate supervisor.
 There are perhaps Pete, for instance.
 I just don't trust Mr.
 Hornberger, sir.
 He has a ridge on the section of the skull associated with deviousness.
 So there's a girl.
 Yes, sir.
 Her name is Daphne.
 She's one of the TGS dancers.
 And when I watch her dance, my heart skips a beat.
 And not because of my acute ventralitis.
 Wait.
 You're dating one of the dancers? I actually haven't spoken to her yet, but I have a long-term plan to marry her, and I wanted the company to be aware of my intentions.
 I see.
 I'll be sure to mention that at the next board meeting.
 Thank you, sir.
 Also, I don't know if this is harassment, but someone at The Today Show made me eat an unripe banana in front of her.
 Do you know who our immediate supervisor is? I will not be able to attend your wedding.
 Because of a prior conflict.
 What's the special occasion? Weekday.
 So this is normal? This is, like, your version of sweatpants and pop-tarts? Not too shabs.
 Short for shabby.
 Hilarious.
 This could be your life too, Liz.
 Just short the housing market.
 Or write a cookbook specifically for mixed-race children.
 Or marry a rich, old dude who dies.
 Clive, I wanna say? Or have mild lupus and great insurance.
 Here is the plan for today.
 Start with facials and massages Private shopping at Bergdorf, swing by the dermatologist for a tune-up.
 Dinner at Jewel Bako, then a nightcap back here.
 That is a plan.
 But, I don't think I should go.
 Liz is still stressed about her old job.
 It's just It's Friday, and at my job that is our biggest day.
 I don't think I'd be good company.
 But thank you for inviting me.
 I'll have one drink here.
 Have two.
 But then I really should go home, 'cause I'm still in work mode, I'm not really in spa/shopping mode.
 I wouldn't be able to enjoy myself.
 And I don't wanna crash your day together and ruin it.
 We're always together.
 Cocktails.
 It's just so stressful thinking at my employees trying to do everything without me.
 Those look great on you.
 Then I'm buying them.
 I guess I'm just one of those people that needs work.
 I thrive there.
 And it's gone just like that? Thank you, Dr.
 Binderman.
 Isn't he amazing? My point is, you are so sweet to include me.
 Believe me I'm jealous, but today's just not the day.
 So, you know I'll hang out with you guys for a little bit, and I'll have my one drink, and What time is it? Almost midnight.
 If we're gonna get up in time for our mani/pedis, we really should turn in.
 I forgot to watch my show.
 I'm prepared to do a nipple slip.
 Just talk about the movie.
 Hi, I'm Ethan from Nick magazine.
 Whose mom are you? Thank you.
 Well, tonight's about fun.
 I'm wearing Taylor Dayne for Express, and my peace sign, of course, is a nod to Japlin Joplin, who Dora The Explorer's Backpack! Backpack, is map in you tonight? Here are your lunches, gentlemen.
 I forgot to get you extra mustard.
 All right, enough! This fighting stops now! I'm sorry.
 Mr.
 Slattery hurt me, and now I'm hurting him.
 He'll never get mustard.
 Except for the mustard that comes with the sandwich.
 I said I was sorry, Ken.
 I didn't even mean to hurt you.
 Really? I love you too, Dotcom.
 I didn't say I knew this would happen someday.
 A woman would come between us.
 Well, I'm not standing by.
 I'm taking action.
 Before miss lemon left, I promised her I wouldn't let you start any adventures.
 Well, Liz Lemon's in jail now.
 And somebody has to step up and take charge around here.
 Let the problem solving begin.
 Are you Daphne? Yeah, you're fired.
 First a backpack upstages me, then the paparazzi kept calling me Dina Lohan, and now the cyrus family has decided to rock a bunch of funky hats.
 You can't give up now.
 Did Jackie Jormp-Jomp give up when vampires attacked Woodstocks? Nobody even knows I'm here.
 From Dreamworks's upcoming feature film On Top Of Spaghetti, Helen Mirren.
 Good evening.
 And now we take a moment That's horrible.
 You got me.
 And now we take a moment to remember those we lost this year in the kid entertainment industry.
 Was that me? Did they just say I'm dead? I thought you spoke to the producers.
 Connor, if we don't get some traction, Jenna Maroney's picture's dead.
 We need your help.
 Maroney.
 Picture.
 Dead.
 Got it.
 This is a disaster.
 We hit the jackpot.
 You being dead is the best thing that ever happened to this movie.
 I wanna Tupac you.
 Fine.
 But I have to pee first.
 Tupac Shakur, the rapper.
 He sold ten times more albums when he was dead than when he was alive.
 We're going to do that with this movie.
 Die young, become a legend.
 Just like Janis.
 Or Rusty, the bear from The Magicals.
 You just need to stay dead while I sell the movie.
 I can play dead.
 I watched my whole church group get eaten by a bear.
 Congratulations.
 You've completed your sensitivity training.
 Your suspension is up, and here is your certificate.
 So I can go back to work tomorrow? That's soon.
 I know how eager you are to return to work.
 I guess so.
 But coming back to work isn't always easy.
 Work means stress.
 And stress can make you fall back on old behavior.
 So tonight, I want you to really think about that first day back.
 Visualize everything that's facing you.
 Think about walking through that door and immediately dealing with 100 different problems and responsibilities.
 Your coworkers' demands on you, the long hours, the pointless meetings and endless phone calls.
 Think of the frustration, the futility, and the time that you will never get back as you creep closer and closer to the grave.
 Any questions for me? Just one.
 Why don't you drop those dockers and gimme a piece of that sweet ass? What're we doing today, ladies? More of the same.
 Chell-o? What the happened? Jeffrey Weener-Slave said you put your fingers in his mouth.
 Did I? Or did he put his mouth on my fingers? It's gonna take at least six weeks paid leave to get to the bottom of this.
 I'm very busy right now faking Jenna's death to sell her movie.
 I'm not going to engage on that.
 Mantra.
 But I am calling H.
R.
 and getting you back.
 No, I need a little more time off.
 I'm on humanity leave.
 Good god, what Indigo Girls song is that from? "Syllabus Of Us" off Vagabonds, Martyrs, and Quilts.
 The point is I have met the most amazing group of women.
 They just live.
 And they spin every morning, and they go to museums.
 Lemon, you are not a rich divorcee.
 I know.
 But I have some money saved.
 Enough for two years.
 Maybe four if I give up cable.
 So I will me back to the show in four years.
 You're fooling yourself.
 You can't live like that.
 I can.
 Emily and her friends are happy.
 Believe me, there is no solace in their luxury.
 Only deep despair.
 How do you know all these Indigo Girls songs? Listen, you are wrong about Emily.
 God, there's a spider nest in my yoga mat! Mr.
 Jordan, what did you do? You fired Daphne? I had to.
 Friendship and trust in the entourage is the most important thing.
 Like that HBO show.
 John Adams.
 Me and Dotcom are back to being best friends.
 Never But the other dancers are refusing to come to work out of solidarity with Daphne.
 Usually, this is the point in my process when Liz Lemon steps in and takes care of everything.
 Heavy is the head that eats the crayons.
 I'm gonna take a nap.
 See you in ten hours.
 Have any of the dancers come in yet today? Pete.
 A word.
 Jenna's dead.
 I don't feel anything.
 What's wrong with me? No, it's a marketing ploy.
 For her new movie.
 But it means you won't have her for the show on Friday.
 And you need to put together some sort of on-air tribute.
 We actually already have an obituary reel for Jenna.
 We put it together after she cheated on that mobster.
 That's good.
 Eating right, working out, sleeping Is anybody else BM-ing like a rock star? What's the hump day schedule look like? It's not Wednesday, Liz, it's Thursday.
 I read somewhere it's Tuesday.
 It's Friday.
 We really need to tell Mr.
 Hornberger that the dancers quit.
 No we don't.
 He's not even gonna notice they're gone.
 These are the new dancers, kid.
 Say hi to Velvet.
 Hello, miss Velvet.
 Just think, an hour ago they were brawling in a parking lot, but tonight, they're gonna be stars.
 Show Ken what we worked on.
 Boy, I am really starting to feel the benefits of massages and yoga five days a week.
 Check this out.
 Look at you.
 Last week you were flipping out about missing work.
 That's old Liz.
 My boss kept trying to tell me that I would go crazy living a life of leisure, that it's unhealthy.
 He's actually right.
 No, he's not, Emily.
 I used to be a neurosurgeon before Jasmine guy and I wrote our cookbook, and the human brain needs stimulation or it atrophies.
 And your pleasure center literally shrinks.
 That's why we do our special activity.
 To combat that.
 What, like, sudoku? We did a games night for a couple of weeks.
 Didn't last.
 So charity work? Charity work sucks.
 Should we tell her? Erin, it's too soon.
 Punch me in the face, Liz.
 I'm sorry, what? You heard me.
 Punch me as hard as you can, and then I am coming at you like an animal.
 God, is this a fight club? The pain proves we're alive.
 This is very disappointing! Come on, hit me.
 Get a taste.
 I brought a roll of quarters to hold in my fist.
 Jack was right.
 I have to get back to my show.
 I need the show.
 You want out, Liz? You're gonna have to fight your way out.
 As we celebrate the life of Jenna Maroney The coast guard won't declare her dead yet, what the pirates did to that boat! Well, it's a very generous offer.
 We'll be in touch.
 What the hell are you doing here? They're talking about me.
 I'm really better today.
 So's the laundry, thanks to CleanFree.
 That was some of Jenna Maroney's earlier work.
 It's hard to believe that both of those women outlived her.
 Especially the woman on the right.
 We'll be right back.
 A couple of gay guys were crying.
 This is just the greatest night of my What the hell is that? It's you.
 What's the problem? It has the year I was born on it.
 The real year, not the actress year.
 Now almost a million people are gonna know that I'm f It's too late to change it.
 Jenna, calm down.
 I'm selling the movie in the next 12 hours.
 Your movie.
 Think about what matters here.
 In five, four, three And finally tonight, what more fitting way to say good-bye to our friend than with the gifts she gave all of us Her music.
 Ladies and gentlemen, Itzhak Bemelmans and the Tracy Jordan dancers.
 Give me a microphone.
 Still alive.
 Not yet 32.
 Sorry, Jack.
 Worth it.
 I'm back.
 What did it turn out to be? Lesbians? Fight club.
 This is a disaster.
 What is wrong with you two? You guys mess up everything you touch, and then I have to come in here and fix it.
 I am so mad.
 Why are you smiling? You're freaking me out.
 You two troublemakers.
 Come here! She's gonna do something to us.
 You're crazy! I'm back, nerds!   

                




                    			I'm looking for an engagement ring.
 Are you sure? You should have had one the first time.
 She wouldn't have said no.
 She didn't say no.
 She said we should think about it.
 Yeah, that does not mean yes.
 In my experience, "let's think about it" usually ends up with me watching Solid Gold in my basement on prom night.
 The point is I thought about it, and haven't changed my mind.
 In fact, I've coined a new term to describe what Elisa is to me: "the one".
 The one? As in "the only one for me".
 The one I'm meant to be with.
 Get it? The one.
 You should be a writer.
 Check out the bling! Or whatever it's called now.
 Good god.
 I got it! Oh, god, there's a vent! She's very spirited.
 Like a show horse.
 You're a lucky man.
 Oh, no.
 She's not the bride.
 This is the one I am marrying.
 My apologies, sir.
 Please follow me to the real showroom.
 My finger is caught in the vent! Where are my snow balls? I was gonna go to the gym later, so I deserve a treat.
 Miss Lemon, we can't have coconut products out anymore because of staff allergies.
 What? No, allergies are psychosomatic.
 The only reason I'm allergic to dogs is because one bit me the first time I got my period.
 No, allergies are real.
 If I have strawberry, my throat shuts up faster than a girl in math class.
 I didn't know you had allergies.
 If my cousin Stephanie eats a walnut, her throat shuts up faster than a Filipino at a Guys! Come on.
 Not okay.
 I'm sorry, Mr.
 Rossitano, no unauthorized food.
 Don't worry, no food in here.
 Just a doughnut box with a mouse in it.
 Are the pranksmen going after Lutz again? Someone say my name? Hey, look.
 Awesome! Doughnuts! Proofreading: Valpi Episode 319: "The Ones" We've narrowed it down.
 Great.
 What are we talking about? He has to get a present for his wife.
 This Saturday is the 20th anniversary of the night that me and Angie met.
 She was working at the Dyker Heights Arthur Treacher's, and I was residing there.
 She slipped me a free shrimp combo, and we've been together ever since.
 So this present has to be special.
 It's either gonna be a denim jacket that says "hot bitch" in diamonds Or a slanket.
 Angie doesn't want that.
 Why don't you ask her what she wants instead of spending all this money on junk? You are wise, Liz Lemon.
 Like a genetically manipulated shark.
 So as a token of my gratitude, I got something specially for you.
 I'll take that slanket too if you're not gonna use it.
 Puerto rican! That's interesting.
 I mean Puertorico, where you're supposed to be.
 When did you get back? Actually, three weeks ago.
 Why doesn't Jack know that? Cause I don't know what to do.
 I'm afraid he's gonna wanna go through with his proposings of marriage.
 Sorry, I haven't spoken english in two menses.
 Are you saying that you don't wanna go through with his proposings at marriage? I don't understand.
 You love him.
 I do.
 That's why I call him"el uno".
 But I cannot marry him because of a terrible secret.
 Please don't ask me what it is.
 I won't.
 I don't want to know! Are you a man? Really? That's your guess, a man? You wanna see me naked? Sort of.
 I love Jack so much.
 I don't think I have the strength to tell it to his head.
 That's why I was hoping that you thank you for doing what I cannot! Good-bye forever, Liz Lemon.
 Well, I see why he likes it.
 I hope you have learned a lesson.
 Because of what you did, we almost lost a monitor.
 I'm sorry.
 You're a big fan of mine, and you're not gay? Not even bi-curious? I don't know what to tell you.
 I love your show.
 I read your blog.
 I've got all your albums.
 Even the one with Phil sector.
 I still think it would have sold better if he had shot me in the face.
 Glad you didn't get shot in the face.
 Thank you.
 But if you had I would have liked to have gotten that call.
 That would have been nice.
 Us Weekly is calling to confirm a story that your animal rescue shelter is supplying quesadilla meat to amusement parks.
 What? I need to call my lawyer.
 I'll be right back.
 Don't go anywhere.
 Dude, we gotta go, man.
 I stole some pens! Mr.
 Lutz, this is my telephone number.
 Please, give it to Jenna Maroney.
 You okay? Good.
 Hey, Jack! Do you have a sec? It's over.
 It's over before it started.
 Drink with me.
 I'm sorry, but I'm glad it didn't have to come from me.
 What are you talking about? And you? Wig-go.
com, Sheinhardt Wigs' user-generated video content site.
 All anybody posted on it were penises.
 What did you wanna talk to me about? Hey, Jack! Right, okay.
 I have been trying to figure out how to not tell you this.
 Mi amor! Querida.
 I'm back.
 Let'get married.
 I'll call plunder and have them hold a table so we can celebrate in style.
 And carbo-load for the reunion sex.
 Lemon, isn't it wonderful? Don't dare say anything about my secret.
 I'm not going to because you have to.
 You okay? I didn't see you there.
 I'm fine.
 You sure you don't wanna talk? Well, it's kinda none of your business, but alright.
 I met this cute paramedic yesterday.
 He thinks I'm incredible.
 We're perfect for each other.
 But he left before I could get his name.
 I'm sure there's a way to find out.
 I called 911 they wouldn't even connect me to their celebrity service.
 I don't know what to do.
 You know, your dilemma reminds me of a book I read once.
 See you later.
 No, no.
 Listen.
 There's this question psychiatrists use to identify sociopaths.
 A woman goes to her mother's funeral, where she meets the perfect man.
 Love at first sight.
 But he leaves before she finds out who he is.
 So what does she do to see him again? She kills her father, hoping that the guy will come to that funeral too.
 That's correct! Oh, boy Thanks for the advice.
 No, that wasn't advice! She'd have to kill her father's doorman and anyone who might have seen her.
 And you for giving her the idea in the first place.
 Liz Lemon, you dummy! I'm wearing it as a joke.
 I asked Angie what she wanted for our anniversary, and she wants me to get a tattoo of her name.
 OK, you like tattoos.
 And above it, she wants this picture of her face.
 I can't have this on my chest scaring off beautiful women in the clubs.
 You know I like to socialize.
 And you know my signature move with the ladies is taking off my shirt! Now it's a Sophie's choice.
 I can't get this tattoo and I can't tell Angie no.
 What do you want me to say? Sorry I made it harder for you to cheat on your wife? That's a start.
 That's a start! Strawberries! My real name is Dick Whitman! Someone call the cute guy at 911! I need to ask you something, about Elisa.
 Did she say anything to you, anything at all, about a secret desire to keep her maiden name? No.
 Sorry.
 Because I'd like her to be Elisa Donaghy, but if she wants to be Elisa Padriera-Donaghy, then Elisa Padriera? La viuda negra! What? What does that mean? The black widow.
 Elisa has a terrible secret.
 My current theory is she's the mother of those Michael Jackson kids.
 OK, I searched Elisa Padriera and the black widow, but all web sites are in spanish.
 Blue writing on green.
 Why? Call that cleaning lady back.
 We need somebody who speaks spanish.
 I speak spanish.
 Puertorican! Viuda negra! Let me explain.
 There is nothing you can say that will change the way I feel.
 I'm so sorry to tell you such a dark tale while wearing such a silly t-shirt.
 I was married once, and I killed my husband.
 It was a crime of passion.
 He cheated on me.
 And in a rage I took my revenge! You know me.
 I'm a catholic.
 I take the bonds of marriage very seriously.
 Why aren't you in jail? They threw my case out.
 I couldn't get an impartial jury after that song about me came out.
 La viuda negra I guess I'm glad you know.
 I understand if this changes everything.
 It's up to you.
 I already put my wedding announcement in Cigar Aficionado.
 How about this? You get the tattoo, but when you hit the clubs, you draw a mane around the face with a marker and make it look like a lion named That is a great idea! If you want everyone to think I own a gay lion! Tangiers? No judgment in brainstorming.
 Look, this is my reputation we're talking about here! Use your heads! The Moroccan national soccer team is The Lions.
 Tangiers is in Morocco.
 So, yeah, I guess I'm an idiot.
 Have you ever met anyone that's killed somebody? I think my grandpa may have.
 But he never really liked to talk about what happened at Kent State.
 I still want to marry Elisa.
 You do? Really? So she had one bad day.
 Being in a relationship means overlooking certain flaws.
 I mean, somewhere right now, a guy is on a J-Date with Monica Lewinsky Nobody's perfect.
 Jack I'm 50.
 To put it in perspective, that's like 32 for ladies.
 How many more Elisas am I going to meet? God bless.
 I guess I just really don't understand men.
 Nobody ever said you did.
 Pardon me.
 Excuse me.
 What are you two doing here? Where's the hot guy? Are you taking any medication? Yes.
 Where's the cute paramedic who was here last night? He was wearing a uniform.
 He was totally into me.
 He must work the evening shift.
 So there are different shifts? Like on a sheik's pleasure yacht.
 It's not product placement.
 I just like it.
 What if I marry Elisa and I accidentally cheat? She could snap again.
 She's very passionate, and she doesn't react well to betrayal.
 Why won't you open? What a quandary.
 Wait, I have a suggestion Don't cheat.
 But you never know.
 What if I find myself stranded in a snow cave with a stern but comely lady geologist, both of us knowing that our only chance for survival is the heat from our naked bodies? Sorry, I just do not get you guys.
 Again, that is not being disputed.
 But my options for male advice around here are limited.
 So I think the Pranksmen should all wear fedoras.
 Could the hats have feathers? Face it, you are the closest thing to a man working here right now.
 Well, dude, I guess you gotta find a comely geologist and a snow cave and see what happens.
 I need your help.
 My fiancee murdered her ex-husband when he cheated on her.
 Continue.
 I love her.
 But the only way I can make sure that I won't stray Is for me to arrange a test of erotic temptation.
 Exactly.
 We're going out tonight, Jackie D, and you're gonna be tempted like Jesus in the Wilderness.
 Jesus is my stereo guy, and the Wilderness is a club I took him to once.
 Jenna, come quick.
 Kenneth's passed out again.
 I can't believe this is happening during night shift! For God sakes! What is this, third watch? Kenneth ate strawberries again, and now he's gone into acute strawberry shock.
 Is that a thing? Just ask this real EMT.
 We're gonna have to cut off his hands.
 He's gonna learn how to urinate with his feet.
 How could this have happened again? It's my fault.
 I did it.
 I just wanted that hot EMT to come back.
 I didn't mean for it to go this far.
 I'm so sorry But I am not a monster.
 I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy she poisoned so this other boy would go to town on her.
 I think she's had enough, sirs.
 What's happening? Is this a trick? I knew it! I was just playing along.
 No seriously, what's happening? Jenna, do you feel genuine remorse? Thank God.
 Sociopath downgraded to extreme narcissist.
 Now, quit it with the strawberry stuff.
 Or you might once again feel the righteous lash of the Pranksmen.
 Is that a thing? You and your friend wanna party later? Sure thing, baby.
 Give the kid a call.
 This is decadent.
 And I once went to Miami with Darryl Strawberry.
 Tip of the iceberg, Jackie D.
 You can have all of this whenever you want.
 Or you can marry that nice lady that you're in love with.
 It's up to you.
 I love Elisa.
 But you love Angie, right? Of course I do.
 Angie's the one.
 Where did you hear that? It's a thing I made up after seeing the Matrix.
 Elisa is my one.
 But Tracy, sometimes I think men like us aren't built for marriage.
 This is something I've never told anyone.
 This is my terrible secret.
 In the 20 years that I've known her I've never cheated on my wife.
 There.
 I said it.
 Don't look at me.
 Wait a minute.
 That can't be the truth.
 The partying is just for show.
 And because I'm a high-functioning alcoholic.
 All the phone numbers you see me hand out, they're not even mine.
 No, this isn't Tracy Jordan.
 Really? I've not heard of that term before.
 Do you know how to get to Connecticut? That's an inspiration.
 I mean, if you can do it So can you.
 Because I'm a ridiculous, unstable human being.
 What is wrong with me? I mean, if Elisa's only flaw is that she demands I be faithful, then I will be faithful! And if Angie wants me to get a tattoo of her to prove my love, then I'm getting that tattoo! Grizz, get the car.
 Dotcom, get the coats.
 And which one of you ladies wants to pick up the tab? I put strawberry juice in your chickpeas.
 And in your water.
 And on your harmonica.
 My what? You mean my mouth radio? I am so sorry.
 I just want you to know that I would not do this to you for just any guy.
 He was special.
 I really thought that he was the one.
 It's horrible to think you might have found your true love, only to lose him.
 It hurts more than my foot botox to know that he's out there, and I have no way to find him.
 When you call 911, tell them they have to send everyone.
 Earn this! You remarkable son of a bitch! We have an emergency! Workin' on my night cheese Do you know what time it is? I was sound asleep.
 I heard you singing Night Cheese.
 I've had a crazy night.
 We all can learn a lot from Tracy Jordan.
 We went out clubbing.
 His life is like Enron, 1999.
 It's wild.
 I'm sure it was.
 How are you so quiet when your parades are so loud? You were supposed to be thinking about us.
 And you spent the whole night partying with that black guy! Did she not come here with you? Have you been following me? Then you come here at 4:00 in the morning? I knew your relationship was too weird not to be sexual! Everybody be cool.
 Wait a minute, you're jealous of Lemon? That's insane.
 Come on, look at me.
 Elisa, I proved to myself tonight that I would never cheat on you.
 That's why I went out with Tracy.
 And I came to Liz's because Because she's your bro.
 Exactly.
 This is troubling.
 And how do you think I feel? I get a ring on my finger for one day and I start acting like Glenn Close in "Atraccion fatal".
 That has a whole different title here.
 Isn't there a slanket somewhere you should be filling with your farts? Baby, this is my curse.
 I love too deeply.
 And eventually it makes me loco for Choco-Puffs.
 If you ever find yourself less in love with me, I hope you'll give me a call.
 But if tonight is what it's going to be like, obviously, engagement-wise, we are not going to forge ahead.
 Is it my English, or was that not a great breaking-up speech? It was your English That was quite moving.
 You look happy.
 What, did you settle that lawsuit over your exercise tape? Even better.
 I had an amazing date last night.
 And it's all thanks to Kenneth.
 It was nothing.
 Sure, I was legally dead for 5 minutes, but I did it for true love.
 Actually, it turns out Roger has sole custody of his five-year-old son, so Wait a minute, you were dead? I'm fine.
 But I think I brought something back with me.
 Did you even go home last night? And where is your shirt? No, and at large.
 I might've went out and had a little too much to drink last night, but you'll be proud of me, Liz Lemon co-J.
 'Cause I went out and got that tattoo Angie wanted me to get.
 How you like me now? That is one gay lion.
   

                




                    			- How late is Tracy now? 2 1/2 hours.
 This is outrageous.
 Especially after I was told I can't leave during the day for my ridiculous anger management stupid piece of crap! How did this happen? Grizz called him at 8:00 and pretend it was 11:00.
 I printed fake rehearsal schedule, saying we start at 9:00 instead of noon.
 And I set all his watches and clocks to say p.
m.
, when it's really a.
m.
 Boy, we may have overdone it.
 What the hell time is it? Hey, you're here! Let's rehearse! I took my son to his cello recital this morning at what turned out to be midnight yesterday! White oppressors, answer my question.
 What time is it really? You're a bunch of racists.
 How did we jump to that already? You treat me like a child! No worse than that! You treat me like one of those little pageant girls with the clip-on teeth.
 Oprah says that you teach people how to treat you, it's what you've taught us, cause you're always late and take no responsibility for your actions.
 Irregardless! You know what? Race card.
 Don't accept it! Just a heads-up.
 Tracy knows what time it is.
 Damn it.
 Your mother would like to have breakfast with you at the hotel tomorrow and she had me make dinner reservations for tonight.
 And by night, I mean 4:30 this afternoon.
 Colleen's in town? If you need a break, I'd be happy to take her out.
 There's a restaurant hostess in midtown I'd like to see cry.
 Thank you, but I need to be the attentive son this visit.
 This Thursday marks an anniversary for my mother, an unpleasant one.
 went out for a pack of cigarettes, came back, smoked one, told my mother he was leaving forever, and walked out the door.
 Boy, that must be hard For both of you.
 He treated her like dirt all those years coming and going, taking up with other women, including more than one Unitarian! Every time he came back, I promised myself I would tell him off.
 I had my speech all planned.
 But I always chickened out.
 It's the biggest regret of my life And I once made love to Kathy Hilton.
 Do you want a hug? What is this, the Italian parliament? No, thank you.
 Well, you're a good son.
 I know she's not easy.
 Sir, your mother had me move her from the Plaza to the Carlyle.
 Evidently, the concierge at the Plaza "has a beard", and she'd rather not get raped.
 Please, tell me we've started.
 Actually, we're on 2nd run-through.
 What is this? Tracy hasn't come back yet, but he sent a gibbon to rehearse in his place.
 He's pretty good.
 Did you guys know about this? Tracy has asked us to read this prepared statement.
 "Dear racist Liz Lemon "This is how you treat me, "like a white-whiskered gibbon "put on this earth to do nothing but dance around for your amusement "and reduce the insect population of Malaysia.
" I don't know which of these five cell numbers he answers, but you get Tracy down here right now.
 Why? The gibbon is on time, he knows his blocking, and he doesn't try to bite the dancers! I think I've proven my point.
 Oh, my god! Like we really have time for you to walk down the stairs that slowly! Time jump! Tracy, it costs the show a lot of money when you pull these shenanigans.
 Don't patronize me with your Celtic slang.
 We have a black president now.
 What do you care? You voted Nader! This is post-racial America and I demand to be treated like everyone else.
 You wanna be treated like everybody else? Fantastic.
 Then tomorrow, I'm sending a regular town car for you instead of one of those duck tour boats.
 Fine.
 And, you're no longer allowed to point at women in the cafeteria and yell, "I wanna get that pregnant!" Fine, I'll bring my lunch from home.
 And be here tomorrow at 10:00 a.
m.
, and know your lines.
 You don't think I could do that? We'll find out tomorrow at 10:00 a.
m.
 Fine, but I'll have the last laugh.
 So.
, Valpi, Collioure.
 Episode 320: "The Natural Order" Beth, that was a big mistake you made.
 Grizz, it was a year ago.
 You're engaged now.
 Just drop it, OK.
 Yelling at Tracy in front of everybody was a bad move.
 It's not my job to protect his feelings.
 I told you she would turn cold.
 She's an ice queen.
 I'm just saying.
 You humiliate Tracy in front of everybody like that, you give him two choices One, he won't show up tomorrow, and you'll look like a fool in front of your crew.
 Or two, he will show up and find an even worse way to act out.
 Exactly.
 What are you doing here? I'm here to pick you up for dinner.
 No dinner.
 We're having breakfast in the morning.
 I told your girl.
 My assistant is named Jonathan.
 I know.
 I met him.
 And he also said we had a reservation for dinner tonight.
 Jack, there's been a misunderstanding.
 I have a previous engagement with a friend.
 Colleen, can I borrow one of your ties? Oh, brother.
 Paul, this is Jack, my son.
 Jack, this is Paul Brett.
 Mother, I didn't realize you were bringing a companion along.
 Companion? How fancy.
 Paul lives in Florida.
 He paints landscapes and he makes his own soda.
 Why don't you join us for dinner? Great! I'll call the restaurant.
 See if they can seat a third wheel.
 Another day done.
 Let's get outta here before we realize we've forgotten about something.
 I feel like we're half-assing this.
 I didn't know anyone was here.
 It wasn't me screaming in the bathroom.
 What about him? Mr.
 Jordan says he doesn't need it anymore.
 So you're just letting him go? Don't worry.
 Once it tries to mate with a child, I'm sure animal control will shoot it.
 He's not an animal! Look at him! He's a little person! He loves me! Somebody loves me.
 I'm gonna name him Little Jenna and let him live in my dressing room.
 Colleen brought her boyfriend.
 His name is Paul.
 What? Really? I don't like this guy.
 I don't trust him.
 He's 4 years younger than my mother.
 He wears a pinkie ring.
 When the waiter brought over the food, he said, "abbondanza".
 I know it's a stressful time for you and your mother Right, I don't like the timing of this at all.
 Colleen is very vulnerable right now, and scam artists can smell that.
 Have you ever been to Florida? It's basically a criminal population.
 It's America's Australia.
 Come on, maybe he just likes her.
 Some men like older women.
 Let's not make this about you.
 I've gotta call my private investigator.
 Liz, they want you on stage for rehearsal.
 Tracy's here already? I guess so.
 This food area is always the first place I go to look Thank you, Cerie.
 Tracy, you're here already.
 Professional is my middle name.
 No need.
 I've got it memorized.
 I'm going to do a valentino cross, camera right, then dump the laugh.
 So stay on your fours, guys! One, two, three, jump and pose! Time for union break.
 Thank you! That is so great for morale.
 Listen, about yesterday No.
 Do not apologize.
 In fact Everyone gather around.
 Actor announcement.
 I want to publicly thank you, for you have shown me that in today's world everyone should be treated exactly the same.
 No one should get preferential treatment.
 I agree.
 Exactly.
 Not black comedy superstars.
 Not Hispanics.
 Not Indians.
 Not whatever this guy is.
 And not women.
 I'm right there with you.
 Good.
 I feel parched from being so professional.
 Could I trouble you for some water? Of course.
 Brian, would you help me out with this? Equality.
 What? Everyone should be treated the same, right? You should change it.
 I know how to do this.
 No one help her! I got it.
 That's good.
 Gotta get my hammies in the handles.
 Hold on.
 All right! Let's take it from the top.
 Hello, Len.
 Thanks for meeting me here.
 You staking out a cheating husband? No, I'm taking a photography class.
 Look at the way the sunlight hits that cobweb.
 So what have you got for me.
 I looked into this Paul Brett guy, and I gotta tell you, it's the weirdest case I've ever worked.
 I knew it.
 What is he, a check forger? Real estate swindler? Bird owner? No, he's clean.
 What? I've never seen anything like it.
 Everyone's got something to hide.
 For instance, I'm wearing a child's Halloween costume under this.
 But this guy No priors, no debts.
 He's been married to his wife Louise for 35 years.
 He's married? I wish I had more to give you.
 But this Paul Brett guy, he's He's like a boy scout.
 I'm sorry Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Miss Maroney, I have the ukulele you asked for.
 It's not for me.
 Someone's in a little mariachi band today.
 Ma'am, this is a wild animal.
 You can't treat it like a person.
 No, he's happy.
 His costume is hiding his erection.
 As a child, I had a prize pig that I thought was my best friend.
 But then one day, I picked up one of her piglets.
 She went crazy! She bit off my nut sack that I kept tied around my belt to feed squirrels.
 Please be careful, miss Maroney.
 Tracy did that thing with the water on purpose.
 Grizz and Dotcom warned me he would act out.
 Look, if Tracy's revenge plan involves him being good at his job, you might have to just take it.
 Hello, Liz Lemon.
 I was just telling these fellas about how you don't wanna be treated any differently because you're a woman.
 Well, thank you.
 Of course I don't.
 Really.
 You don't want us to hold back anymore? I'm sorry were you holding back something? Our farts, to start with.
 Also, we didn't invite you to Lutz's fake bachelor party.
 What? I realize I'm never getting married because of my gland thing But I wanna have a bachelor party.
 You should have invited me.
 It's not fair that you didn't.
 We're going to a strip club.
 I'm glad that we're having this conversation, because we live in a world where a lot of the old divisions are starting to disappear.
 I hope to have a daughter someday and I want her to God, what is that smell? Dear lord, Frank! It's like orange-flavored egg! It's in my mouth! Good.
 We're learning.
 This next one's me.
 Do you treat me any differently because I'm a woman? Well, I pay you a little less, yes.
 I mean day-to-day.
 Do you coddle me? In some ways.
 With a man, I can be more direct, but with you I have to have a conversation, talk things through more.
 Gimme an example.
 Well Right now comes to mind.
 Are we through listening and sharing, cause I have something I want you to look at.
 It's a marriage certificate.
 It's Paul's marriage certificate, my mother's boyfriend? He's married.
 What? I knew I was right.
 That guy is shady! My god.
 Have you told Colleen? No Colleen.
 I have an opportunity here, a chance to go back to the past to put things right that once went wrong.
 That's The Quantum Leap intro.
 Be that as it may, I'm finally going to stand up for Colleen.
 The small part of her that is still human deserves it.
 I'll see Paul and give him the speech I wrote for Jimmy Donaghy.
 Paul's not your dad.
 But Paul's here.
 And he's taking advantage of my mother.
 What I originally wrote for my father may be dated.
 Who would be our current Nikita Khrushchev? Simon Cowell? Now you're standing on the very spot where Gracie Allen took Jack Paar's virginity.
 I thought I heard a tour.
 People are not gonna believe that you saw this.
 So take a lot of pictures.
 Miss Maroney.
 No good will come of this.
 This is unnatural.
 It is unnatural for a grandmother to look this good! Little Jenna had a baby last night.
 Thank you.
 Good job with the water.
 What the hell? What? I'm trying to treat you like one of us.
 Shouldn't you be working down on stage? I'm done with my work.
 I was very professional.
 That must have been hard for you.
 It was.
 All right, Tracy's here.
 Let's do this bachelor party.
 You coming, Liz Lemon? Because a dude boss would be a jerk not to come to Lutz's bachelor party.
 Also a dude boss would pay for it.
 I'm coming.
 Of course I'm coming.
 But you're not.
 Twist! You have to stay here.
 I haven't gotten your notes on the rewrite, and your input is invaluable to the process.
 Since we're all equal now.
 Let's go see some naked daughters and moms! All right! I'm sorry, your mom's out shopping.
 I know.
 My credit card company called to confirm my purchase of a book entitled Intercourse after hip surgery.
 Well why don't you come on in? I'm just watching the hotel channel.
 You can check out on the TV.
 I bet you can, you son of a bitch.
 I beg your pardon? I'm tired of watching you treat my mother like this.
 I'm not afraid of you.
 You're just a big bully.
 Like Simon Cowell.
 That's right.
 I just called you a communist.
 I want you out of our lives forever, and I want you to know that I'm never gonna be anything like you growing up.
 What in god's name is going on here? Paul is leaving, mother.
 And I think you should know why.
 He's married.
 I know that! Paul, find something to do in the bathroom.
 I have to talk to my son.
 Shoot.
 You knew? It's Florida, Jack! It's like it never stopped being the 70s down there.
 And a guy like Paul, who can drive at night, you just don't say no to that! I apologize then.
 I thought we were going to get through this together.
 I guess your coping mechanism is to bring a married man back to your hotel room! Coping? What am I supposed to be coping with? It's the 35th anniversary of dad leaving! Which time? That man left and came back so many times that I totally lost count! One night, he went out to move the car, and he was gone From the spring of 57 until One night he just showed up out of the blue! "Put your shoes on, Collie.
 We're going to see Some Like it Hot.
" Are you kidding me? No, I'm not kidding you! You honestly don't remember when he left for good, cause I sure as hell do.
 Oh, my god.
 Is that what this is all about? Is that what you've been holding onto all these years? Stop wasting your time thinking about that man! You're nothing like him, you know.
 No way you ever could be.
 What does that mean? I don't know.
 I'm old, Jack, you know? And I don't know what I'm thinking about half the time.
 I do know this, you're my good boy.
 I just love ya to death.
 Thank you, mother.
 And I love you too.
 You're on your own tonight.
 I have a date with my son.
 He's taking me out to a late dinner.
 It's 6:00.
 Say you like my body.
 I don't wanna be here! I don't like it here! Who's this guy? Which one of us is gonna give up first? The black one.
 I can't take it anymore! I hate it! One stripper took of Lutz's shirt.
 That gland thing is no joke! Everything is upside down! We must go back to the way things were with both of us getting preferential treatment.
 Yes.
 We upset the natural order.
 You're going to strip clubs.
 I'm up writing all night.
 Look who's a sailor! We're dressing monkeys up as people, and monkeys are playing with people as toys! It's not a toy! Little Jenna thinks that this is her baby.
 You said you loved me! Your foot fingers are so strong! We don't wanna end up like those two.
 You're so right.
 We're okay! He's just expressing himself! Before you hear crazy rumors and start believing them, the gibbon did not attack Jenna.
 He was trying to mate with her face.
 What? Nothing.
 Everyone's fine.
 Some Like it Hot, I love this movie.
 My mother told me she and my dad went to see it together, and if that's the stuff she remembers, maybe that's how I should remember him too.
 On a date with my mom, instead of walking out the door.
 to write back then.
 You could get away with crazy plot twists because audiences were so much less sophisticated.
 Wait a minute.
 This movie came out in 1959? How could my father have been gone from the spring of 57 until 1959 if I was conceived in 58 Jimmy Donaghy is not my father.
 Twist!   

                




                    			Congratulations.
 I see you read my memo about having more catchphrases on your show.
 What catchphrases? Are you talking about if your man leaves in boxers and comes home in briefs, that's a deal breaker, ladies.
 If he wears an Atlanta Falcons jersey to your sister's wedding "that's a deal breaker, ladies.
" This is gonna be huge for Jenna.
 And for me, cause I wrote that phrase.
 If you say so.
 Is this really what you wanted to talk about? What else is there to discuss? Really? You're gonna do the repressed Irish thing? Be Italian for like one second.
 I'm-a Jack.
 I don't know who my father is.
 I'm-a so emotional, I'm gonna smash these barrels! We're not discussing that because I've made a decision.
 I don't wanna know who my real father is.
 Are you kidding? Why? You know what family means to me? Resentment, guilt, anger Easter egg hunts that turn into knife fights.
 Why would I wanna invite more of it into my life? Why would I want more family? Because maybe he's awesome.
 Why don't you just ask your mother who it is.
 No, not Colleen.
 She had her reasons for keeping this from me for 50 years, and I don't want her to relive it.
 Also, I want something really juicy to whisper to her on her deathbed.
 I don't have a lot of personal life experience, but if I have learned anything from my Sims family When a child doesn't see his father enough, he starts to jump up and down and then his mood level will drop until he pees himself.
 Why don't I have any other friends? So.
, Valpi, Collioure Episode 321: "Mamma Mia" Come on in, Jack, I'm just practicing sitting.
 Why did you never try to find your father? Because he's dead.
 How do you know that? Because I'm rich and if that man was alive, he'd be living in my pool house, and I'd be paying him $200,000 a year to mow my lawn.
 Exactly.
 That's all family is a drain.
 I feel like you're not telling me something.
 Let me guess.
 You bought a sidecar for your motorcycle, and your dog won't stay in it.
 I found out I don't know who's my father and I'm not sure I ever wanna know.
 Why? Jack, every man should know his father.
 That's easy for you to say.
 No, it wasn't.
 I struggled through that sentence.
 But I'm know what I'm talking about.
 Because not long ago A son I didn't know about found me.
 What? My love child tracked me down.
 I was shocked, scared, angry, like a dog in a sidecar when it comes loose from the motorcycle.
 But it turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me.
 Thanks.
 You know who else loves deal breaker? Bret Michaels.
 We have the same publicist, she said he'd love to come and dress in the same outfit and do it with me.
 And he wants to be on the show.
 They used that catch phrase on Sports Center last night.
 Rangers on the power play.
 Oh, Avery! That's a deal breaker, ladies.
 This is it! This is the defining thing of my life! It's not gonna be that hit and run! Calm down.
 Try to imagine how excited you would be if something of yours blew up like this.
 This is mine, Jenna.
 I wrote it for you, remember? Right! It's ours.
 That's what I meant to say.
 There's a reason you're the writer.
 Everybody, gather up.
 Actor announcement.
 No human announcement.
 There's something I want you to hear from me before you read about it in next month's issue of Black Entrepreneur and Butts Magazine.
 I have a illegitimate son.
 Feigned surprise.
 Obviously, my family and I wanted to keep this private, but somehow, those vultures in the media found out about it.
 Like a dog in the sidecar when it comes loose from the motorcycle.
 But it turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me.
 Thanks.
 So should we continue our interview? Now, I didn't know about this boy up until three years ago.
 But I've been supporting him financially ever since.
 And I want you to meet him.
 He's here? I want you bastards to meet my bastard.
 My baby boy, Donald Jordan.
 How's it goin', y'all? Pop, can I have $1,000 for something I need? As long as it's for something you need.
 I love you, man.
 I love you, daddy.
 Len, come in.
 Thanks for meeting me here.
 This is my office.
 I know.
 But once I'm in the building, I can get into the cafeteria and that means free ice.
 Right.
 So what did you dig up for me? I was surprised when you called me about finding your father.
 Especially since you called on the old home line.
 Hasn't been ringing much since Marcia left.
 I guess in the divorce settlement she got all our friends.
 I gave my gun to my pastor.
 You know, in case I get the old gloomies again.
 So do you have anything for me, Len? Your father's name and contact information is in this envelope.
 I'm sorry.
 I'll give you some privacy.
 Oh, god.
 There's no way that's Tracy's son, right? That guy is scamming him! Maybe, Donald did look pretty old.
 I know.
 But I do have a hard time telling ages with black shoes are the best kind of shoes.
 How old do you think I am? 25.
 50.
 I am 33.
 How old do you think Samuel L.
 Jackson is? 50.
 25.
 Mr.
 Jackson is 61.
 OK, what about this? Maybe Donald is Tracy's son because maybe Tracy is 60.
 That's ridiculous.
 Think about it.
 He can't rap.
 He has diabetes.
 A lot of his friends are dead.
 Falls asleep in chairs.
 Doesn't know how to use a computer.
 Always mad at the TV! His favorite show is NCIS.
 He might be 70! Or he's getting scammed.
 I don't get it.
 There's three names on here.
 Without hard DNA evidence, Len was only able to narrow my father's identity down to these 3 men.
 Mamma mia! It's a mamma mia! What? Nothing! Don't push it, let it happen.
 There's gonna be a mamma mia! See what happens? See how complicated family always is? What should I do, fly around the country to figure out which one is my father? They could come to you.
 We could trick them into coming here, and then we'll sing on the dock! What are you talking about? It's Mamma Mia! The international film songsation? Based on the jukebox musical? The songs of Abba? It's a movie! Should we just watch it real quick? This was too much trouble when it was just one person.
 I'm out.
 No, it's perfect! We mamma mia these guys.
 We get them here under some pretense, figure out which one is your dad, and then if it's someone you don't want in your life, you walk away.
 How do we even get them here? They won a contest A trip to New York and tickets to TGS.
 All right You get them here.
 I'll meet with them.
 But that's all I'm promising.
 And all I'm promising is a madcap musical romp, dot, dot, dot, fun! Dot, dot, dot, good! That was on the poster.
 Why won't this stupid gizmo do what I want? I'm gonna miss the lotto drawing.
 You're 39, right? Of course.
 Why would I lie about my age? I'm in the entertainment industry.
 Right.
 Liz and I were just talking about that old Rob Base song, it takes two Everybody our age knows that song, right? Ladies love me, girls adore me I mean even the ones who never saw me Like the way that I rhyme at a show The reason why, man, I don't know so let's go, cause It takes two to make a thing go right It takes two to make it outta sight Not familiar.
 But what about this song? Gee, it's great After being out late Walking my baby back How old are you? Well, if you're 39, how old do you think Donald is? I'm 21, right, dad? Yes, you are, son.
 That's what that birth certificate you printed out for me said.
 You got that check for me? Of course! And I left the amount blank just like you asked.
 Donald's opening a dojo.
 I'm-a teach karate and whatnot to kids Or whatever.
 Starting a small business is expensive! I bet it is.
 Remember this song? If e'er a fair maiden A knight chanced to see Astride his fair steed to spy The contest winners are here.
 My three dads! Are you ready to meet them? This is George Park.
 He's Korean.
 Welcome, Mr.
 Park.
 And this is Fred O'Dwyer.
 Tell Jack the story you were telling in the elevator.
 In world war II, a kraut grenade exploded my genitals.
 So no children, right? No chance.
 Looks like a bowl of spaghettios down there.
 And Jack, this is professor Milton Greene.
 Nice to meet you.
 And it's nice to meet you, Jack.
 Sorry.
 There was something in my throat.
 I'm Milton Greene.
 Have a seat.
 Jenna has a photo shoot for Time Out Magazine.
 For what? Nothing.
 They're gonna name her the funniest woman in New York.
 What time do they need me there to make her seem funny? I know you're upset, but Jenna fully acknowledges that you write the deal breaker sketches together.
 We write them together.
 She texts her gay friends while I write till 4:00 in the morning eating dry fistfuls of raisin bran to stay awake.
 Which, is how I'm able to ride the fart train to work every day.
 This is your job.
 This is what you signed up for.
 I know.
 I like it when you use your calm, reasonable dad voice.
 That's the voice you should use when you tell Jenna that I'm gonna be in that magazine with her.
 I'm-a save this for later.
 Look at that scammer.
 What 21-year-old wraps up half a muffin? Kenny.
 Well, hello stranger.
 Do you like magazines? I sure like S&amp;M magazines.
 S&amp;M is my abbreviation for super and magical.
 I'm selling magazine subscriptions to benefit the community center.
 How many you want? Four? Great! That's like $80! I'm-a get your address from my daddy.
 Instead of doing it now.
 Good plan! We gotta stop that guy.
 How can we prove Tracy that he's lying? I've asked Cerie to look into getting a copy of his birth certificate.
 You can't get someone else's certificate I know, I've tried to steal my dead neighbor's identity cause sometimes it feels like too much, and maybe daddy just needs to get in the car and drive.
 We gotta catch Donald in a lie.
 What else do we know about him? He claims to know karate.
 That's gotta be bogus.
 But how do you test someone's knowledge of karate? I know karate.
 So gentlemen, is there any history of mental illness in your family? Don't get me started.
 My cousin killed everyone at his job.
 How about you? No, the Greenes are sharp as a tack, right to the end.
 Which makes the end all that much more terrifying.
 My father died screaming.
 Greene That's sort of a vague name.
 You meet a lot of other Greenes at your church? Christmas? We're agnostic secular humanists.
 Sure, but if you had to pick Is that you and Tom Delay? "The hammer" is a hero of mine.
 I'm sorry.
 Did you just snort at our former house majority leader? He was never my house majority leader.
 You've got to be kidding me.
 Here's Tom Delay's legacy to the United States: raping the environment, waging an illegal war History will validate the liberation of Iraq.
 I was talking about the war on drugs.
 Not to mention the hypocrisy of espousing family values while demonizing single mothers.
 What do you know about single mothers? What do you know about families? I will not be spoken to this way.
 I'm a contest winner.
 And a professor at Bennington college.
 Bennington! How's that going, teaching those kids that couldn't get into Middlebury? How dare you! How dare you.
 You are a huge disappointment to me.
 I do not understand why we're yelling at each other, but I am not accustomed to losing an argument.
 So you know what? Screw you.
 And your fakakte contest.
 Oh, god, no.
 Looking beautiful.
 I'm gonna get some tape.
 Oh, my god, Liz.
 I'm so glad that you've insisted on doing this.
 Thank you for so graciously including me.
 I know this kind of thing is all you have in your life.
 Wait what is that? I thought that for some of the pictures, it'd be fun if we got a little wacky.
 I know you've never done this before, but I had to learn the hard way don't use the props.
 They try to get you to take one funny photo.
 It's the one they use, and you look like an idiot.
 That's always the one they use? Don't do it.
 Just open your mouth a little and try to look like Lindsay Lohan.
 Great.
 Fabulous, ladies.
 You look beautiful.
 Now, Jenna, catch the chicken.
 Nice try, pal.
 Not my first time on the merry-go-round, chief.
 Not gonna do it.
 Staying like this serious and horny.
 I don't know.
 With the chicken, it could make a great cover.
 I'll hold the chicken.
 Great.
 That's great.
 That's so great.
 Now act like the chicken farted.
 You're the funny one.
 Great! That's so great.
 I am Lutz.
 I understand you study the art of the empty hand.
 I challenge you to kumite! Front kick.
 Front kick! Escape kata! Pete, Liz, I see you! Help mommy's baby! Help mommy's baby! Jack, what did you say to Milton? If Cornel West weren't speaking at the new school tonight, I think he would have left.
 He should leave.
 It's exactly what I was afraid of.
 More family, more aggravation.
 I'm walking away.
 Why? He's just like you.
 He's smart and worldly, and really good at making fun of my shoes.
 When he saw these, he asked me when my cult was committing suicide.
 That's pretty good.
 But Milton Greene and I are nothing alike.
 I have one scotch with the guy, and it devolves into a screaming match about Tom Delay.
 So you have a couple drinks, fight about politics, and you take it personally when he doesn't agree with you? That's called having a dad, Jack.
 Don't walk away.
 I think you'll regret it if you do.
 Or I could regret telling him.
 Why would a man like that want me as a son? Maybe he won't.
 I don't know.
 But so what? It'd hurt, but then you'd just go back to being Jack Donaghy, which is pretty cool.
 Thank you.
 My hair just dries like this.
 Exactly.
 Or you tell him, and he starts crying and you hug and then you have a dad.
 Which is pretty cool too.
 Maybe you're right.
 I am.
 Either way, you're gonna be OK.
 One of those two things is gonna happen.
 There's no weird third thing.
 Thank you, Liz.
 By the way, did the medical supply store where you bought those shoes have any women's stuff? Donald obviously knows karate.
 We still don't know how old any African-Americans are.
 It reminds me I got the birth certificate you asked for.
 You did? How? The guy just gave it to me.
 You will get old someday.
 Stop writing that check! He's 40.
 Don't sign that.
 That was to put in Dotcom's birthday card.
 But you're right The card is enough.
 Donald is older than you are.
 He's scamming you! I know.
 I'm sorry, what? I may hug people too hard and get lost at malls But I'm not an idiot.
 Then why are you giving him money? When Donald came to me, he was a fast-talking charmer from the wrong side of the track.
 He reminded me of someone John Travolta's character from Grease! And me.
 So giving Donald money is what charity? Call it what you want.
 But in the last three years, Donald has gone from scamming celebrities to being a small business owner.
 The dojo is real? And the community center is thriving.
 You know Kenneth's $80 bought a chess set and a crate of condoms? Those kids are really lucky.
 Daddy, do you wanna go uptown and see the dojo? Or should I say the Tracy Jordan Institute for Black Karate? That's what y'all naming it? Thank you, son.
 Well, I hope you're happy with your cover.
 Oh, boy.
 They went with birthing the chicken on the toilet.
 Why didn't you listen to me? Because I thought you were just trying to keep me from being in the magazine.
 I was just trying to keep you from embarrassing both of us.
 You wanted attention? You got it.
 I hope you're happy.
 I'm on the cover! And this is the backstage area.
 I'd like to speak with Mr.
 Greene for a moment.
 And as head of this tour, I'm going to deny your request.
 Do you remember a woman named Colleen Donaghy? Sure.
 That takes me back a few years.
 Yeah, right! She rented me a room when I was a graduate student.
 One month I couldn't pay, so she said maybe there was something else I could give her.
 So I gave her my radio.
 And a couple of weeks later, we got drunk and had sex.
 I'm Jack Donaghy, Colleen's son.
 I was born around nine months after that.
 Oh, my god.
 What wait a minute.
 Is this contest some mamma mia thing? I'm your son.
 Of course you are.
 I should have known the minute I saw you.
 I have a son! A beautiful son! And I have a dad! Fate has brought us together, Jack.
 You opened a whole new chapter in my life! Isn't it amazing? You don't know the half of it! I need a kidney! This is so great!   

                




                    			- You know what the kidney does? Of course.
 I was a kidney in my fifth grade school play.
 I'm a kidney The other kidney is singing now.
 Milton needs a kidney.
 Milton, as in your dad? My dad? I don't know this guy.
 Professor Milton Greene, who's writing a 3-volume biography of Jimmy Carter, and with my kidney he could finish it.
 What're you gonna do? Don't know.
 He's too old for the waiting list, since Giuliani left it's gotten tougher to harvest hobo organs.
 So it's up to me, and I don't want to be a match.
 It's too much.
 Does that make me a bad person? Of course not.
 This is really hard.
 I need your help.
 The brain helps you make decisions And your colon pushes out That's not helpful.
 Sorry.
 So.
, Valpi, Collioure Episode 322: "Kidney Now!" So, NBC is making me go on the Vontella show to promote TGS.
 That show is the worst.
 I know.
 I swore I'd never go on again after that one time.
 We get paid to make each other laugh.
 Meet your half-sister Courtney! Gimme my money, you bitch! Never! They want me as a relationship expert because of the "dealbreakers" sketch.
 And since you're the face of "dealbreakers", you're going with me.
 What? No, come on.
 I thought you wanted the attention.
 Yeah, but not like that.
 Remember the other time you were on? And I was like, "talk to the hand".
 Jenna, come on out.
 You give me back my man, bitch! Never! Can't we just keep doing magazines? I will see you on Vontella.
 Kidney transplantation is no laughing matter.
 So, I apologize.
 Kidney's just such a funny word.
 How long is this going to take, Leo? This is the consent form for the test today.
 This is incorrect, doctor, I'm not giving him a kidney.
 It's the other way around.
 Brother.
 Are you sure? If anyone is giving anyone a kidney at all.
 Who knows? You know what? I'll just remember that it's the opposite of what these say.
 I'd really be more comfortable if you rewrote the form.
 No, I'll remember.
 Opposite! But you're clear that he's giving a kidney to me.
 I think you're jumping the gun.
 We don't even know if we're a match, so you shouldn't assume that you're gonna get my kidney.
 Of course.
 I'm sorry.
 It's just that without a kidney, I'm going to die.
 I think it's the hard "k" sound that's making me giggle.
 Kidney! Exciting news.
 Your old high school wants you to speak at graduation.
 And they said you could drop up to five f-bombs.
 Not interested.
 Why not? Because Frank Lucas high school was a hellhole.
 Grizz knows.
 He was there.
 A drug dealer named Campbell, he ruled that school.
 He wanted me to find a snitch called "baby".
 Campbell wanted me to cut him open.
 Oh, my, that's very urban.
 I wouldn't do it.
 I dropped out.
 And I vowed never to go back to that place.
 "Campbell" was actually Mr.
 Campbell, his science teacher.
 His science teacher was a drug dealer? That's terrible.
 Science was my most favorite subject.
 Especially the Old Testament.
 He wasn't a drug dealer.
 Tracy dropped outta high school because Mr.
 Campbell wanted him to dissect a frog.
 Tracy couldn't do it, he cried in front of the whole class.
 It was bad.
 I had to deny ever being friends with him.
 Just like Peter did to Jesus in science.
 If your boyfriend calls out his brother's name during sex, that's a dealbreaker, ladies.
 That skit was crazy.
 That actually happened to Liz.
 Vontella don't care who Liz is.
 Jenna, we have a surprise for you.
 I swear to God, Courtney, I will rip your wig off.
 No, honey, Courtney's dead.
 You are gonna answer our audience's relationship questions! This guy I'm dating owns a tanning salon but he won't let me tan for free, but he lets girls with tan for free, so I go to this other tanning salon to try not to make it a thing, but you know how there's no secrets in the tanning salon community, so what should I do? I don't know.
 Boy, whatever that just was, it's a dealbreaker because this guy is making you talk like a crazy person.
 You have sexually transmitted crazy mouth.
 Dealbreaker.
 My fiance and I keep arguing about our wedding plans Your fiance is gay.
 Look at him.
 Look at you.
 Classic case of fruit blindness.
 "Fruit blindness"? Sir, have you ever kissed a gentleman? One time in college.
 And a lot since then.
 My boyfriend has been acting weird ever since he got promoted at his job He thinks he deserves a va-jay-jay upgrade.
 He doesn't.
 He's not Tom Brady.
 Shut it down.
 Dealbreaker.
 There's no such thing as bisexual.
 That's something the invented in the 90s to sell hair products.
 Dealbreaker.
 Only one snake in the bed.
 Dealbreaker.
 I think you guys are gonna make it.
 I know Mr.
 Campbell wasn't a drug dealer.
 Yes, he was.
 I know he was your science teacher.
 And I know he didn't ask you to cut up "baby", he asked you to cut up a frog.
 What frog? I know you couldn't do it, and you cried.
 And that's why you left school, because you were ashamed.
 It's true! There is no "baby"! I was chicken! A guy crying about a chicken and a baby? I thought this was a comedy show.
 You know how I can get to Jack Donaghy's office? Yes, sir.
 52nd floor.
 I understand how hard that must've been, but it was so long ago.
 You can't understand, Ken.
 Where I come from, street cred is everything.
 That's why when I left that school in shame, I vowed never to cry again.
 And I never have! Don't die! I love you, Jack! I want diet slice and some pita chips.
 I don't wanna be here! I don't like it here! I was just callin' y'all a bunch of racists.
 We're not really best friends, we're just good friends.
 I was chicken! I'm never going back to Frank Lucas high school to be reminded of my greatest failure.
 I think it's sad that you're still ashamed of that kid.
 That kid is you.
 I've changed.
 Into a badass adult.
 I have a wolf dog, I have two bad knees, and a gun That I lost! Milton, are you going somewhere? I have to get back to Bennington.
 I owe my publishers a chapter of "From peanut to president".
 But before I go, I think we should talk about the other day.
 Milton, the Donaghys do not talk.
 We let things fester until they erupt in inappropriate anger, preferably during a wedding or elementary school graduation.
 The Greenes are talkers and huggers.
 I'm sorry, Jack.
 I should never have put you in this position.
 Or this one.
 I don't want a kidney from you.
 All I want is to make up for lost time.
 Can I come back next week? We can go to a Yankee game.
 I have great seats.
 In the section between the players' wives and the players' mistresses.
 But I don't go on bat day.
 So, my son likes baseball.
 There's a great sports memorabilia store on Third Avenue.
 Remember Carlton Fisk's home run in the '75 series? That's this ball? That's a ball he fouled off in the third inning.
 No, I want you to have it.
 Milton, that's too generous.
 No, I insist.
 For bringing me into your life.
 I can't.
 We're having a catch.
 Don't ruin it.
 Just like Jimmy and Chip Carter.
 Did you hear what I said? This is great.
 Damn, Ken, you know who that was? I don't, sir, do you? I grew up with that guy.
 He was the baddest gangster in my class.
 We called him "Mean Steve", but his real name was Steven Killer.
 Does seeing him in this menial job make you think about anything? If a badass O.
G.
 like that could get stuck deliverin' food, how did I get out? Because you're not a bad-bleep O.
G.
 You're a sensitive artist.
 You're different.
 Isn't that a message those kids at your old high school should hear? You're right, Ken.
 They should.
 Five f-bombs, right? Jack, it's Leo.
 I got the results of your blood work back.
 Right, yes, and? "Cytoxic cross match of target HLA resulted "in lyses of cells.
" In layman's terms, what do you think that means? I don't know.
 Could I give this guy a kidney or not? "Due to negative blood tissue match, "transplantation is not recommended.
" Damn it, is this written in greek? It means we're not a match.
 I was really looking forward to putting your father's kidney in you.
 The other way around.
 That's not what this forms say.
 I'm getting Milton Greene a kidney.
 You're a match? No, I'm not.
 Where are you gonna get a kidney from? I don't know, but I have the entire liberal media establishment at my disposal.
 The same manipulation machine that got people to vote for Obama and donate all that money after rainstorm Katrina.
 I'm going to use that to find my dad a kidney.
 You should do a celebrity concert.
 Like that gay guy did to benefit old gays.
 A benefit concert like "We Are The World".
 Or "Weird Al" Yankovic's less successful parody benefit "We Are The Pizza".
 Tell Pete to start building a set.
 Wait a minute, we have to do this? You found a way to do your day job and be on Vontella Great job, by the way.
 I haven't seen that many riled-up dirtbags since CVS put the cold medicine behind the counter.
 They want me to go back on Vontella, actually, but I'm not sure I'm qualified to give relationship advice.
 You're not.
 Suburban 7th graders have more sexual experience, but that doesn't matter.
 Right, because I'm helping people.
 No, you're helping yourself.
 So make the most of this opportunity.
 After all, how many years does TGS have left? I don't know.
 20? What do you tink this is, Wings? You've got two more years, at best.
 This is what I've been trying to tell you since I first met you.
 Life is short.
 You've gotta get out there and get yours.
 "Get yours.
" I like that.
 Can I use that as one of my catch phrases? Sorry, Spaceman's using it as the title of his new sex book for couples.
 Thank you all for coming here on such short notice.
 I just had my driver drop me off.
 So how come I saw you getting off the subway? What were you doin' down there? I asked you to be here because you are all deeply committed to charity work.
 My Mary J.
 Blige foundation is celebrating its 10th year of searching for the Loch Ness monster.
 Musicians have banded together before to solve all kinds of problems.
 World hunger, the collapse of the American farm, global warming and you're 0 for 3, guys.
 I am disappointed in us as a group.
 How about a problem you can solve? One song, one man, one kidney.
 Let me get this straight.
 You want us to do a charity concert for one guy? Elvis, haven't you said that if a song reaches just one person, you've done your job? No, I've never said that.
 Listen, the man who needs the kidney is my father.
 We just met and I don't want to lose him before I get a chance to know him.
 Please.
 I'm asking for your help.
 Let's cut to the chase.
 M.
J.
, you owe me.
 Who got you out of a 20-year exclusive performance contract at SeaWorld? Aiken, your cousin Kenneth Parcell already promised me you'd do this.
 And Elvis, or should I say Declan McManus, international art thief? OK, Jack Dona-You-Tumbled-Me.
 We'll do it.
 Also, you have a ton of interview requests.
 And they want you on the 7th hour of the Today Show tomorrow morning.
 Tell them all yes.
 I'm getting mine, Cerie.
 Also, Pete and Tracy's wives are in your office.
 Paula is Pete's wife, and Angie is the black one I got it.
 Dr.
 Liz, we need some advice from you.
 I don't know if that's a good idea.
 I know you, and I know your husbands I just found out Tracy has a secret credit card I didn't know anything about.
 Not on my watch, biatch.
 And he's been using that credit card to pay for a hotel room here in New York two days a week.
 S that d.
 Shut it down.
 Dealbreaker.
 Pete is refusing to drive to my parents' place for just two weeks of family vacation.
 No to the way to the jose.
 But Paula, talk it out before you walk it out.
 And I'm here in New York while he's back in Hooglanderveen.
 Long distance is the wrong distance, Sue.
 Dealbreaker.
 Mickey Rourke wants to take me camping.
 Dealbreaker, Jenna! God! I haven't seen my fiance in seven months.
 I have two words for you.
 Robot warning.
 That catch phrase needs a little work.
 Teach it like ya preach it, Liz Lemon! I almost didn't make it here this afternoon.
 But then a very special friend of mine showed me the way.
 So I'd like to take a moment to thank Victor Cordova from the Sunoco station on Lennox Avenue.
 But there's another reason why I almost didn't come today.
 Fear.
 Fear of letting people know the real me.
 I have but one thing to say to all of you.
 Be yourself.
 And I'm talkin' to you clearly, gay kid.
 Who told? And you white kid just tryin' to go unnoticed.
 Come on.
 Just be yourself.
 And I guarantee you every single person in this room will one day be president of the United States.
 Before you go, I have a special surprise for you.
 OK, but I'm allergic to horses.
 It is my pleasure to award you this honorary diploma.
 Congratulations.
 Take a breath, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Who wants my autograph? So you can see how important this is to me.
 Are you in? I'm in.
 I think it'll be fun.
 I actually played a kidney in my fifth grade school play.
 With this loser I'm in, but when Costello's not lookin' I'm gonna punch him in the head.
 Fair enough.
 Are you doing my musical benefit idea? Because I'd love to be It didn't work out.
 Jenna, you know my European friends, Rokus and Shandelay.
 Please to meet.
 I'm going out for a couple hours.
 OK.
 I'll just I'm meeting a book agent about writing a dealbreaker book.
 He's gonna take me to lunch wherever I wanna go.
 Do you know if there's a sit-down Quizno's in midtown? Never mind.
 Liz Lemon, you dumb bitch.
 Here's the reason I don't wanna go on that family vacation it's a working farm.
 And I'm the only one whose hands are big enough to guide the bull during mating.
 Dealbreaker.
 Shut up.
 There you are, you stupid cracker.
 You know why I get a hotel room? To poop in peace.
 No kids bangin' on the door, no phones ringin'.
 It's my time! Every Tuesday and Thursday at 3:00 pm! I don't know why I only go twice a week.
 That's what Angie should be worried about! You've gotta stop giving advice.
 You don't know what you're talking about.
 I'm not stopping.
 I'm gonna write a book.
 I have to! This is my next step! What're you talking about? This job isn't gonna last forever.
 TGS has two years left, tops.
 How'm I gonna live? I only have $300 million.
 This is crazy, Jack.
 I've never seen anything like this.
 And I was at "We Are The Pizza".
 I thought I had to do something.
 Once I found I wasn't a match, I felt like I'd let you down.
 You couldn't let me down, Jack.
 Get a room.
 Yeah, get a room.
 High school graduate.
 Do you know what this means, Grizz, Dotcom, Ken? We're goin' to college! And so began the craziest summer of my life.
 How'd you say that without movin' your mouth? Say what? Lemon, how are you? You know what? I'm good.
 I've got a book deal, a free sandwich in my pocket, and I have this weird, loose feeling in my shoulders.
 What is that? It's either hapiness or osteoporosis.
 I think it's happiness.
 You're getting yours.
 Jack, what have you done? I called in every favor I had.
 He's my dad, Liz.
 We were best friends in elementary school! We're live in three I'll talk to her later.
 Sometimes life brings pain and strife And all seems wrong That is when you find a friend and write a song So give the gift of giving Give it far and give it wide Take the leap Reach down deep inside And just give a kidney To a father or a dad Just give a kidney We hear it doesn't really hurt that bad And we know you'll want to give it To a super human being So get it done We just need one For Milton Greene This country has 600 million kidneys And we really only need half That leaves about 300 million kidneys Do the math He needs a kidney Don't ask why he could die If you don't call today Listen, when someone starts talking in the middle of a song, you know it's serious.
 So give Milton a kidney.
 We all believe in this cause so much that we're doin' it for free.
 Except for Sheryl.
 Right, I'm the only one gettin' paid.
 And only three of us are drunk.
 Milton Greene needs a kidney.
 Just like I need this beard.
 You don't wanna know what's under here.
 And while you don't have two beards, you do have two kidneys.
 Think of it this way, if I had $2, I'd give you one, wouldn't I? I'm one of the drunk ones.
 They say that two is better than one But sometimes one is better than two If you had two heads You'd wish you had one How is this different? If you had two dogs attackin' you You'd want just one There, we proved our point He needs a kidney Don't ask why he could die If you don't call today He needs a kidney No, he doesn't need a hand He just needs a kidney A hand would be an even harder thing To give When you give a kidney We sure had quite a year.
 What're you talking about? It's May.
 Do some good We pass the cup They stitch it up You do some good Yeah, that's good.
   

                




                    			I wrote that, I'm Liz Lemon! "If your man is over 30 and still wears a nametag to work, that's a Dealbreaker.
" But not you, Mike.
 That's not you.
 Mike, leave my cutout alone.
 Oh, okay.
 Oh, God.
 Okay, you know, I'm going to do the same thing to your cutout.
 Oh, wait, you don't have one, because you're nobody! Ow! Blammo, another successful interaction with a man.
 Uh, yes, Mr.
 Geiss, of course.
 Well, I'll only be in D.
C.
 For the day.
 But if I find time, I'll be sure to go see Fonzie's jacket.
 You sit on it as well.
 Hey, if you're going to D.
C.
, I lost my retainer there during a junior high field trip.
 What can I do for you, Lemon? Well, I wanted to give you a copy of my book.
 They used your blurb.
 "Lemon numbers among my employees.
" Sir? Your bus to Washington leaves in half an hour.
 You're taking a bus? I have to.
 Ever since these buffoons from Detroit took private planes, the rest of us have to put on a show.
 And now, your President, who, by the way, is Kenyan and smokes cigarettes, has created an Industry Task Force for microwaves and small appliances.
 Why? Do you need to be bailed out with my tax dollars? Even if they wanted to, I wouldn't take it.
 It's corporate welfare, Lemon.
 Granted, the microwave industry isn't what it used to be.
 And the American love affair with the microwave oven has cooled since its post-war heyday.
 # Then she told her daddy she was doing the microwave # # Do the microwave # # Do the microwave, wabba, wabba, wabba wabba # Did that happen? But unlike Detroit, we don't need handouts or regulation.
 I'm going to go down there, talk circles around these hacks, and catch the afternoon bus back to Chinatown.
 Now where was the last place you remember having your retainer? I took it out to eat astronaut ice cream at the Air and Space Museum.
 Air and Space "If your man collects action figures, that's a Dealbreaker"? What? Oh, yeah.
 Last weekend, I picked up this girl after practicing Jedi moves in Prospect Park.
 Also a Dealbreaker.
 I took her back to my house on the handlebars of my bike.
 As is that.
 Snuck her inside past my mom.
 She's sees my mint condition Hellboy figurine and starts quoting your dumb book! Yeah.
 Also, my girlfriend is mad.
 In Canada.
 Ugh.
 Miss Lemon, would it be all right if I only worked 20 hours today? I'm volunteering at an animal shelter later on.
 Oh, of course.
 I didn't know you did volunteer work.
 Oh, yes, I also help out at the Pants for Zoo Animals Program and Big Brother.
 Really, I did Big Sister in college.
 That little girl taught me how to use tampons.
 Oh, no, this Big Brother isn't affiliated with the mentoring program.
 It's an organization that secretly watches people and makes sure they are behaving properly.
 Oh.
 Liz? I don't know if you saw the crawl on the T.
V.
 Guide Channel, but I have agreed to star in a sexy, supernatural thriller in the vein of Twilight and True Blood.
 Oh, that's good.
 Vampire movies are hot right now.
 This is actually a werewolf picture that, for tax reasons, is shooting in Iceland.
 I play a moon scientist who's trying to get to the bottom of things and who- spoiler alert- may herself be a werewolf.
 We start shooting tonight.
 In Iceland, tonight? Mm-hm.
 You can't leave.
 You have rehearsal tomorrow.
 Oh, well, why don't you get the new cast member to cover for me? Wow, okay.
 Look, I know that you're mad about Jack's decision to bring in another actor, and you want to punish me.
 Punish you? Please, Liz, I've just always wanted to shoot a student werewolf movie in Iceland where I'm filling in last minute for Victoria Beckham.
 We could sit down and talk about this like adults.
 Liz Lemon you booger face! I'm going to kill you with a bazooka! Ow! I bought my wife that dumb book of yours.
 And the more Angie reads it, the madder she gets at me.
 Well, maybe that's on you, Tray.
 No, It's off me! A book hasn't caused me this much trouble since Where's Waldo went to that barber pole factory.
 It's on you, Liz Lemon.
 And you will be punished.
 This will take 10 minutes.
 Let's hit the Meadowlands racetrack on the way home.
 I've got a betting system based on horse penis size.
 # Bum, bum, bum # Is it true, Mr.
 Donaghy, that your executives routinely used company helicopters to dry their home tennis courts? Yes and no.
 Yes, that did happen.
 No, it didn't not happen.
 And that G.
E.
 Kept a party clown on retainer with a six-figure salary? When Silly Willy's fee was amortized over all birthdays company-wide I'm being told the company money is being gambled at racetracks.
 Yes, but I have a system.
 In 2007, a G.
E.
 Officer used corporate funds to throw a Cabaret themed Halloween party on Fire Island.
 As I recall, that was you.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, I am overwhelmed by the negligence and incompetence.
 It is an affront to your shareholders and, frankly, to the American people.
 Listen, Banks.
 Mr.
 Banks You go and tell your President the truth.
 We don't need the government telling us how to run our industry.
 I've heard enough.
 Why do you have a gavel? This isn't the Congress.
 I brought it from home.
 Congratulations, Liz Lemon.
 Now Angie wants a break.
 So instead of going to a hotel or my houseboat which I cannot find, I'm staying with the woman that started this problem in the first place.
 What? No.
 Tracy, that is not fair.
 Oh, yeah.
 There's a garbage bag in the hallway with a reef shark in it.
 Just put him in the tub with a reef.
 What's for dinner tonight? I want pierogies.
 Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to find homes for all of these animals.
 The most important thing is that you not become emotionally attached to any of them.
 I grew up on a pig farm, sir, where all the animals, even the birds that cleaned our teeth, were workers, not pets.
 I never even had a dog, because, as my mom would say, "You can't eat love.
" And as my mom's friend, Ron, would say, "The donkey died.
 You're the donkey now, Kenneth.
" Yep, just another animal.
 It might as well be a rat.
 An adorable rat who shows you it's okay to be scared during a thunderstorm.
 Why, it seems crazy to me to even give a dog like this a name.
 For example, Bandit.
 And that one's Reggie.
 And up there's Digger.
 Okay, well, the dogs scheduled to be put down today have red tags on them.
 I will adopt all of them.
 Jonathan, call Don Geiss' office and Les Winkler in Corporate Communications.
 Tell Susan Cunningham, Alan Junkin, Mark Jack, What took you so long? Banks, you son of a bitch.
 You know, revenge is a dish best served cold, Jack.
 Like sashimi.
 Or pizza.
 You prefer cold pizza? The morning after? It's the best.
 Better than hot pizza? That's insane.
 You don't tell me what kind of pizza to like.
 You don't tell me anything anymore, Jack.
 It was a year ago that you kicked me to the curb.
 I began plotting my revenge that very day.
 I knew that I had to align myself with something more powerful than G.
E.
 And since American Idol's not on until January, that left the United States government.
 So I spent all last fall raising money.
 Worming my way into the Obamas' inner circle.
 Oh, my God, Malia.
 He did not say that.
 Let's text him now.
 After the election, I could have had any ambassadorship I wanted.
 Even to the world's gayest country: Ireland.
 Instead, I suggested that I take on this Task Force.
 See, I had you in my sights the whole time.
 Peeyow! What kind of gun was that? It's a laser gun, it's unstoppable.
 You listen to me, Banks.
 You keep your spray-tanned, little hands off this company.
 Too late.
 Your testimony's going to make headlines in every paper across the country tomorrow.
 But that wasn't a public hearing.
 Oops, somebody must have weaked it.
 You did, you weaked it.
 Yeah, and I'm just getting started.
 By the time I'm done, you're going to make A.
I.
G.
 Look like the Lehman Brothers of microwaves.
 You would destroy an entire company just to get me? Think of the pensions, the employees.
 The kittens we use to test microwave strength.
 Enjoy the view while you can, Jack.
 You'll be here for about three days, tops.
 Oh, that's all I'll need, Banks.
 You watch me.
 I'll make this company profitable so fast the only headline will be "Donaghy Saves 'G.
E.
' Marries Your Mom".
 See you in a couple days, Jack.
 Peeyow! Bzz Laser shield.
 Tracy and Liz's residence, Tracy speaking.
 Tracy, it's Jenna, is Liz there? It's Jenna, from work.
 Jenna, it's 2:00 in the morning, what's going on? Nightstalkers has encountered some production speed bumps that are complicating my schedule.
 Well, I need you back by Friday.
 What kind of speed bumps? Well.
 Iceland appears to have a different sun than America.
 Because this one is not setting.
 Oh, yeah, of course.
 'Cause it's so far north.
 And you probably don't know this because you've never played a moonologist, but werewolves only come out at night.
 Yes, I remember that from the "Thriller" video.
 Too soon.
 What is your plan, Jenna? Well, evidently, as it gets later in the year, the sun will start to set.
 I'm told tomorrow night, we may get as much as a minute of darkness.
 Really? So you're going to shoot this movie one minute at a time just to punish me? Liz, I don't even know what you're talking about.
 What new cast member? Bye.
 No, you D'oh! What's wrong, roomie? Well, two of my co-workers are driving me insane.
 So I'm going to kill them in their sleep tonight.
 Tracy and Liz's, Tracy speaking.
 Tracy, put Lemon on.
 Hello? Okay, as a single woman would you be more inclined to buy a new microwave if it could be programmed to ask you about your day? Before you answer, consider your loneliness.
 I'm hanging up now.
 Now that we're all up, do you want to talk about the elephant in the room? No, I don't.
 I don't even know why you brought that thing.
 I mean the figurative elephant.
 Liz, I've been reading your book.
 Now I see why Angie is mad at me.
 "If your man has seven cell phones but won't give you any of the numbers, that's a dealbreaker.
 If your man owns a diamond necklace that says 'Open Marriage', that's a dealbreaker.
" Liz Lemon, every little thing I've done is in here.
 You used me to write your book! What? No.
 Maybe some of it is inspired by you.
 You stole my life, and you're going to pay for it.
 Really? You're going to make my life worse than it is right now? How? I'll take all of them.
 Thank you.
 Tracy and Jenna are like children.
 And like children, you can't reason with them when they're upset.
 All you can do is turn the heat up, pour some whiskey in their juice, and wait for sleep to save you.
 Yeah, well, that's not going to work for me.
 Because Jenna is immune to whiskey and Tracy is afraid of juice.
 Oh, and not to add to your problems, but Paula read your book.
 Ow.
 Attention, creative types.
 Brainstorming session.
 Lutz, try to stop mouth breathing for one minute.
 Uh, what is this? It's an idea.
 An idea that started this company, changed the way we live, and made this country great.
 This is Dinesh Mehta.
 He's a design engineer for the Microwave Division.
 All Dinesh and I need from you is one idea that is as good as the light bulb.
 What? I have two days to make people buy a lot of microwaves.
 Well, it's kind of annoying when you're microwaving, like, a burrito and the burrito won't rotate because it's too big.
 It just gets, you know, caught against the sides and the the tray under it rotates, but it, it doesn't rotate.
 Okay, bigger ovens.
 Americans like big, yes.
 What else? What if microwaves broke down more easily so people would have to buy new ones more often? Yes, shoddier, excellent.
 Bigger and not as well-made.
 Wow, that sounds exactly like the philosophy that almost destroyed the U.
S.
 Auto industry.
 This isn't the auto industry, Pete.
 The auto industry was run by a bunch of out-of-touch white guys selling consumers a product they didn't want.
 We're G.
E.
, damn it.
 And we're going to make a giant, flimsy microwave.
 Frank, I can't! If I make it any bigger, the door will be too heavy.
 Fine, forget it.
 Wait Say that again.
 I said, "Forget it.
" "Four, get it.
" Four smaller doors.
 Yes! We'll crack this yet.
 "Wheel crack this yet.
" Wheel.
 Put wheels on it.
 Yeah! Nice.
 Donaghy! Okay, it's go time.
 Are you ready? I'm in character and everything.
 All right, let's do this, the sun is setting! We get one shot at this! Thank you.
 Action! Uh, Claire? I'm sorry, which hand did I have the flashlight in when we were inside? The right! You had it in the right! Thank you! Cut! Oh, great day, everyone.
 You guys are the real stars.
 Since I have neither the time nor the energy to even pretend that your situation is a real problem I cut the baby in half.
 And I will take the top half, for that is the part with the face.
 Lemon, you wrote about Tracy's life for your own gain.
 Tracy should be allowed to use your life as he sees fit.
 I'll have Jonathan call Legal and get a life rights contract drawn up.
 Wait, what do you mean? Tracy will own my life story? No, no.
 What are you going to do with my life story? Something humiliating.
 Thank you, Jack.
 Thanks a lot, Jack.
 It's your only move, Lemon.
 Sometimes the way back up is down.
 Let me tell you a story.
 It's 1994.
 I went ice climbing, and I fell into a crevasse.
 I hurt my leg, and I couldn't climb back up.
 So fighting every natural instinct, doing the thing that seemed most awful to me, I climbed down into the darkness.
 And that's how I got out.
 When I got back to base camp, I went and found my fellow climber, the one who had cut me loose after I fell.
 And I said, "Connie Chung, you did the right thing.
" Thank you.
 Climb down, Lemon, climb down.
 Hey, you're back.
 Yes, Nightstalkers is taking a brief permanent hiatus.
 Well, maybe now we can talk.
 Jenna, I'm your friend.
 No matter what.
 And I will always Oh, Liz, I would really love to do this.
 But I have to go home for the day.
 Got you.
 So you're sticking with the passive-aggressive acting out.
 No, It's not acting out.
 I have mercury poisoning from obsessively taking my rectal temperature.
 And cup holders.
 Everyone loves cup holders.
 Okay, I've been up for the last 50 hours, but I think this is a good idea.
 Let's get rid of the oven entirely and replace it with an A.
M.
F.
M.
 Radio.
 Yeah.
 Okay, it's a car.
 We've invented the Pontiac Aztek.
 Thank you, Subhas.
 You are the dealbreaker.
 Ugh, oh.
 Ugh, that's a bill.
 Tracy Hey, roomie, did you order pay-per-view at my apartment? I'm willing to go splitsies.
 No, I'm not paying for any of this.
 You ordered six adult movies in two days? The Curious Case of Benjamin Butt? Lovely.
 I'ma Do Us? What does that even mean? That's a pun on Amadeus, dummy.
 I will not be judged by you.
 You caused this whole folderol.
 And until you are adequately debased, you will subsidize my predilection for erotica.
 Oh, yeah.
 And I used your credit card to buy a vocabulary course from The Teaching Company.
 So you're saying once you figure out how to get back at me, you and the dogs will leave my apartment? Affirmative.
 I have to climb down into the darkness.
 I know what you should do with my life rights.
 Pete, keep tours out of the studio for the next couple days.
 I need you to build a set that looks like my apartment.
 And get all the hand sanitizer you can find.
 Wait, wait, why do you need Tracy's producing a porno based on my life.
 And I'm writing it.
 I didn't think it would end like this, Jonathan.
 Not with a bang, but with a whimper.
 A whimper indeed, Jack.
 I only came by to wish you luck in your new venture.
 What do you think that will be? Selling fake weed to N.
Y.
U.
 Students? I'll have you know that Barry Diller and I are working on a whole new approach to media, combining all the digital God! Just let me drink.
 See you around, Jack.
 Thanks for letting me be such a big part of you hitting rock bottom, huh? Not yet, Banks.
 I can go lower.
 Into the crevasse.
 What? You played this all wrong.
 You want to humiliate me? You want to destroy me? You should have walked in here with a check.
 Again, what? Sure, maybe you've ruined my career.
 Maybe you'll never see me again.
 But if you had forced me to take government bailout money you'd be my boss.
 Oh, my.
 You'd have to come down to Washington and report to me.
 Like a little schoolboy.
 Your hands sticky from candy.
 And the worst part is, I wouldn't even want the money.
 No, you wouldn't.
 Jack Donaghy taking welfare? It would kill you.
 But with so many jobs at stake You'd have to take it.
 I'd make you.
 I'd make you take it all.
 And I'd roll over and let you give it to me.
 I'm honestly not trying to make this sound gay.
 No one is, it's just happening.
 One word to the President, and I own you.
 I own this office.
 I own that fancy, little fellow outside.
 It'd kill me, but I'd do it for the company.
 Hey, Sasha, is your dad home? What, you have to invite everyone to your party? Even Zach S? Everyone, settle.
 And action.
 It's not just about the new cast member.
 When you always put the show ahead of me, it makes me feel like we're growing apart.
 Jenna, you're my friend.
 No matter what, I will always look out for you.
 That's not going to change.
 Oh, Liz, thank you for giving me the hotter porn lady.
 Okay, we should get out of here.
 Yeah, we should.
 Everything good with Tracy? Yeah, I think so.
 And Jenna and Frank and even Subhas.
 And you? I live to fight another day, but at what cost? Oh, boy, I know the feeling.
 What a week, huh? Lemon, it's Wednesday.
 But it's not all bad news.
 My retainer.
 Now my dad won't be mad at me.
 Ow! Ah! Ah, ah, ow! Take it out, Lemon! You take it out, Donaghy! Everything good with Tracy? I think so.
 And Jenna too and Frank.
 And even Subhas.
 And you? I live to fight another day, but at what cost? Oh, boy, I know the feeling.
 What a week, huh? Lemon, it's Wednesday.
 But it's not all bad news.
 My retainer! How will I ever thank you? And cut! This is disgusting.
 Shut it down.
   

                




                    			Now, remind me.
 Did you just do the Philadelphia cotillion, or did you also debut internationally? I'm happy to say that I don't even get that.
 How was your trip? Terrible.
 I had to give up my window seat to some 7-year-old who had to sit next to her precious mommy.
 Uh, what about the actual purpose of your trip? How is the search for the new cast member going? Okay, I saw a few good alternative comics in San Francisco at San Francisco? I asked you to find an actor from middle America.
 A real person.
 You're not going to find him in the "People's Gay-public of Drugifornia".
 Jeez, relax.
 I'm also setting up auditions in Toronto.
 Canada? Why not just go to Iraq? The television audience doesn't want your elitist, East Coast, alternative, intellectual, left-wing Jack, just say "Jewish".
 This is taking forever.
 Stop trying to amuse yourself and start thinking about what makes actual human beings laugh.
 Who wants my puddings? Now, that's what I'm talking about.
 What a dumb Oh, no, he's really hurt.
 Hey, Tracy.
 Did you hear? Fred Dawkins, the incredibly overweight guy that Pac-Man was based on, died last night.
 I will eat a bowl of cherries and some ghost meat in his honor.
 Orange and black decorations? Is this Halloween or Princeton Parents' Weekend? I don't know whether to be scared or proud of my cousin.
 It's Halloween, sir.
 Proud it is.
 But this "Almost All Saints' Day" isn't going to be much of a celebration.
 I just heard that world famous clog dancer, Jugbert Cody, has gone to a better place.
 He's in Cabo? No, sir, he passed away.
 But at least he died doing what he loved.
 Blogging on the Huffington Post.
 Wow, two down, one to go.
 What do you mean? The Rule of Threes.
 Celebrities always die in groups of three.
 You'd better be careful, Tray.
 Yeah, right.
 That's not a real thing.
 This is going to be the scariest Princeton Parents' Weekend ever! Hey, I read your rewrite.
 Start over, you hack! Miss Maroney, are you okay? Oh, I'm fine.
 Just reminding the writers who's boss.
 With this new actor coming in, I want to make sure I get taken care of.
 I'm not going to be pushed aside and forgotten.
 Like that time at my sister's funeral.
 Ma'am, I don't think bullying people is the way to get them to help you.
 This is show business.
 Being nice gets you nowhere.
 No, being nice can get you everywhere.
 Florence Henderson used to bake cookies for the Brady Bunch writers.
 And in return, they wrote her the role of a lifetime.
 As her own Grandma Hutchins.
 I don't really remember The Brady Bunch, 'cause I was too young.
 But being nice to the writers.
 Interesting idea.
 Think about it.
 Excuse me, Mr.
 Donaghy? I wasn't sure if you were participating in this year's pumpkin carving contest.
 Or if, like last year, I should go jump up my own ass.
 Same as last year.
 Oh, uh, hang on.
 Kenneth, you're from Georgia, aren't you? Stone Mountain, sir.
 Although when the Parcells first came to America, they lived in a town called "Sexcriminalboat".
 Do you think that's Cherokee? Uh, uh, no.
 I mean, you're a Middle American.
 A Joe Average.
 You're the only one around here who knows what ordinary people want.
 So tell me.
 What makes you laugh? The usual, I suppose.
 Two hobos sharing a bean.
 Lady airline pilots.
 I remember growing up in Stone Mountain, my whole family would go down to the Chuckle Hut.
 That's the local comedy club? Oh, no, sir, It's a Chuckle Hut.
 You see, the chuckle is the part of the pig between the tail and the anus.
 But at night, the Chuckle Hut becomes the Laugh Factory.
 And that's a comedy club.
 Lemon, cancel your trip to Toronto.
 We're going to Stone Mountain, Georgia.
 After these messages? Hey, Frank, what is this? It's an E-vite to our Halloween Party.
 I don't want to do that again.
 Remember last year? Hey, I work across the street and I saw you guys are having a Halloween party.
 Yeah, we are.
 Could you close your blinds? You're really bumming all of us out.
 It's humiliating.
 Guys, we can't give up on Halloween.
 It's a magical night where women dress slutty and drink too much.
 Where we can hide our bodies in bulky costumes.
 We've got to keep trying.
 But we suck! Yes, but anything can happen on Halloween.
 Up is down.
 Black is white.
 Good is evil.
 And evil becomes good.
 Hey, writers.
 I baked you cookies.
 Jack, you have to help me! I'm going to die any minute.
 What are you talking about? Celebrities, they always die in groups of three.
 Two have already died.
 And I might be the next to go.
 That's ridiculous.
 I've got to go somewhere where nothing will happen to me.
 Can you get me on Charlie Rose? Tracy, you have nothing to worry about.
 The Rule of Threes is a myth.
 It doesn't exist.
 Like going bald with dignity.
 That said, I would prefer if you take the next one.
 So, this all started when their plane crashed? That's Lost.
 Oh, right.
 You know, I met J.
J.
 Abrams once.
 And I don't know what this means, but he said the island is just Hurley's dream.
 Why is Jenna hanging out with us? 'Cause she's freaking out about the new cast member, so she's trying to suck up.
 I don't like having her around.
 Don't worry, we'll get rid of her.
 One prank at a time.
 There my buddies are.
 Oh, wow, they painted the ceiling in here.
 We're going to find the perfect person for the show down here.
 Someone who represents the real America.
 Jack, for the 80th time, no part of America is more American than any other part.
 You are wrong.
 Small towns are where you see the kindness and goodness and courage of everyday Americans.
 The folks who are teaching our kids, running our prisons growing our cigarettes.
 People who are still living by core American values.
 There are plenty of core American values in New York.
 But there are not restaurants called Fatty Fat's Sandwich Ranch.
 Turn here, turn here! Uh, Lemon, if this is going to play out like lunch, I suggest you crack your window now and save yourself the embarrassment in 20 minutes.
 Now they have hush puppies here, which you might know better as a knish or a beignet.
 I know what you're trying to do, Jack.
 You want to paint me as this New York snob.
 Can I share with you my world view? I'd rather hear you sing "Rocket Man" again.
 All of humankind has one thing in common: The sandwich.
 I believe that all anyone really wants in this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich.
 What a surprise.
 Your world view is food-based.
 And who am I to say that my delicious Italian sub is better than its Stone Mountain equivalent? Which is why I will have the carp po' boy with extra chuckle.
 Keep refreshing.
 Maybe Andy Dick has died in the last 20 seconds.
 Okay, I'll keep looking.
 No, I have to take matters into my own hands.
 Hello? Boo! Who is this? Hey, Betty, it's T.
J.
 Tracy, I haven't seen you since that Rapping Grandma movie we did.
 You were so funny as the rapping grandma.
 So how are you feeling? Any arm pain? Shortness of breath? Plans to investigate corruption in Russia? Wait a minute.
 Are you calling because the Pac-Man guy and Jugbert Cody died? Is this a Rule of Threes call? Um, no.
 Nice try, Jordan.
 But I am going to be at your funeral.
 I will bury you.
 Oh, this carp sandwich is not agreeing with my world view.
 Hello there, folks.
 How y'all doing on this fine October? We have reservations under Donaghy and Lemon.
 We need keys.
 Are y'all from New York? Yes, how can you tell? New York people Always in a real big Hurry, yeah.
 No, it's not because we're from New York.
 We're all the same sandwiches.
 Y'all have a beagle with you? Just give us our rooms.
 Let's see.
 Oh, my God.
 Tell me about the Peach Festival.
 Oh, Peach Festival.
 They've got peach preserves, of course.
 Peach pie, peach wine, peach jerky.
 Ooh.
 Peach butter.
 Unbelievable! I have to apologize.
 You know what they should do with people like her? They should round them all up and put them on an island.
 Oh, wait, they already have.
 It's called Manhattan.
 Down here, we call it "Sexcriminalboat".
 And there's been some Photoshop there.
 Hey, Frank.
 Do you know Sacha, Michael and Gay Michael? Can I ask you a question? Why? God, it's bad enough having Jenna hang out here.
 Now she's bringing her friends? How can a dude in a midriff top dominate me like that? I like those guys.
 I might hang out with them on Halloween.
 What? Why? Have you ever been to a gay Halloween? It's amazing.
 Last year, my girlfriends and I went to Mario Cantone's party in a renovated barn in Chelsea.
 So that's where all the girls are on Halloween.
 At awesome gay dude parties.
 Oh, my God, we go so crazy.
 We kiss each other, get into vans, black out.
 I mean, I'm engaged, but not on Halloween.
 Stop, stop filling Jenna's wigs with raw shrimp! Why? We need to pretend to be Jenna's friends for the next 24 hours.
 She's our ticket to a gay Halloween.
 How come when Jenna suggests it, everybody's on board? No, Lutz, Jenna attracts gay guys.
 Gay guys throw awesome Halloween parties.
 Hot girls go to awesome Halloween parties.
 Ergo, if we're Jenna's friends We spend Halloween with Gay guys.
 Hot girls.
 Hot girls.
 God, are you doing this to me 'cause I took that blind guy's hot dog? Who was at the door? Uh, you probably know him as "Hick at the Reception Desk".
 But his name is Travis Hoagle.
 And, uh, he brought you something for your stomach.
 What is this? "Peppy Bismilk"? Why is everything a little different here? I hate it! You hate it? You hate Travis Hoagle? Choir member, Desert Storm veteran, father of three? I made all that up, but you get my point.
 Do you even care that I am not feeling well? Of course I do.
 There, there.
 Thank you, that's nice.
 Well, I'd love to stay and do this all night, but one of us has to go to the Laugh Factory.
 No, I don't want you going there alone.
 Yes, you do.
 The people here, they're the audience we're trying to reach.
 I get them.
 I know what they want.
 I'm going to find somebody great tonight.
 Hey, Rick, what's the difference 'tween your girlfriend and your truck? I don't know, Pumpkin.
 What is the difference? Your truck don't yell at you every time you get gas.
 Wonderful, Bravo, gentlemen.
 Hey, actor friend! So what are we all doing together for Halloween? Oh, well, Sacha and the Michaels usually have a party.
 Oh, 'cause Lutz and Toof and I always have a party.
 Hang on, what if we combined parties, threw one, big party here in the studio? Is that crazy? No, let's do that! Yes, that gesture.
 I like people who do that.
 A party? With them? Oh, don't look at me like I'm a football game.
 I need those guys.
 I've been using them to make sure I'm taken care of when the new actor gets here.
 Girl, I don't even have the energy to tell you what's happening here.
 So read my face.
 Oh, my God.
 They're using me to get invited to gay Halloween so they can meet hot girls.
 In Metro news, Mary Hillman is going to Gaffney for the weekend and hopes that Martha or Stephanie will water her plants.
 And now an update on Very small town.
 Morning, Lemon.
 I brought you a ginger ale.
 "Schwupps Ginny Pale"? This place is the worst.
 Don't worry, we're leaving.
 Our work here is done.
 Entertainment news: Local funnyman and sub shop owner, Rick Wayne, has been hired by a Catholic to appear on T.
G.
S.
 With a black fellow.
 What? Hear me out.
 We're hiring Rick Wayne and Pumpkin.
 It's a ventriloquist act.
 Oh, I'm too sick See, you think you're not this prejudiced, arrogant New Yorker, but you are.
 Because in your mind, a Southern ventriloquist act can't be funny.
 But you know who does think it's funny? These people.
 These wonderful, folksy, simple Stop calling them simple.
 You know what? You're the prejudiced one.
 Sure, some of these people are simple.
 But some of them are smart.
 Like Matlock.
 Or wholesome.
 Like Elly Mae Clampett.
 And some of them are skeevy dirtbags, like the Dukes of Hazzard, driving around like maniacs.
 Children use those roads.
 My point is Americans are the same everywhere.
 In that we are all different.
 You're wrong, Lemon.
 These people are better, purer.
 Do you know what I did this morning? I assisted in the birth of a foal.
 They named it Jack.
 And it was delicious.
 I know what I'm doing here, Lemon.
 We're hiring Rick and Pumpkin.
 We're not hiring anyone until I see them.
 Good God, Lemon, your breath.
 When did you find time to eat a diaper that you found on the beach? Hi, I'm trying to get to Studio 6-B from here? I'm still finding my way around.
 You look clean.
 Are you a celebrity? Well, I have my own show on N.
B.
C.
 No, celebrity.
 I was in a movie with Queen Latifah once.
 Perfect, I'll show you the shortcut.
 Okay, are you sure this is the right way? Yes, Queen Latifah's Friend, I'm sure.
 Mr.
 Jordan! Are you trying to kill Mr.
 Fallon with that hammer? What the hell? Is this a Rule of Threes thing? Not cool, guy.
 I'm sorry, Ken, but I want to live.
 Mr.
 Jordan, you're going to be fine.
 There is no Rule of Threes.
 Look out! Okay, okay, okay! Truce, truce, okay? But if some celebrity doesn't die soon, I'm going to kill my first guest tonight.
 It's a dog that plays soccer.
 Really? That's your first guest? Yeah.
 Pete, I'm not going to let this happen.
 But what can you do? Well, Jack says I'm just an obnoxious New Yorker.
 So that's what Rick Wayne is going to get tonight.
 And it's going to get ugly.
 What are you Oh, my God.
 You're going to heckle him.
 Like that time I invited you to see my cover band.
 Yeah, and today, the world is better off without the Pete Hornberger Alan Parsons Project Project.
 I may be dehydrated.
 I may still be working a little chuckle out of my system, but don't worry.
 When I'm done, the last thing Rick Wayne and Pumpkin are going to want to do is come to New York.
 You guys, I am so excited, I already put on my costume.
 Get it? I'm an Italian senator.
 Don't you love it? It's going to be awesome.
 And with one word, I can make it all go away.
 Wait, what are you talking about? Oh, cut the crap.
 You boys are just pretending to like me to get in on gay Halloween.
 Okay, what do you want? I want two good sketches a week, a promise to hate the new cast member and no more making fun of me when I misuse dated cultural references, okay? Are we cowabunga on this? Fine, we're cowabunga.
 Good, but if I wake up in any of your apartments tomorrow morning you will buy me breakfast.
 Great.
 All right, the last pig is in the chuckling chute, and we're now the Laugh Factory! We've got a great show for y'all tonight, and we're going to get right to it with Stone Mountain's own Rick Wayne and Pumpkin! All right, you asked for it.
 Good evening, everyone! How y'all doing? Hey, this your first time doing this? Oh, I'm sorry.
 I didn't know it was Filthy, Thin-Lipped Hooker Night here at the Laugh Factory.
 Wow, okay, I underestimated Knock-knock.
 Who's there, Pumpkin? A ferret-faced skank.
 Yep, I see her too.
 Get a job, hayseed! Are you still talking? You are one mouthy bitch.
 I don't go down to where you work and stop them from milking you.
 I'm sorry, but that's enough, sir.
 You're out of line.
 I'll tell you what's out of line.
 Your old lady's knockers.
 Good lord, woman.
 I wouldn't you with Elmo's.
 Rick, pumpkin, what are you doing? A gentleman, whether he's human or, somehow, more than human, does not speak to a lady like that.
 You two are wholesome and decent.
 Oh, I get it.
 You think because we talk like this, we're all simple and quaint? Well, I'm an amateur astronomer and Rick's black wife speaks French.
 Her name's Jamilla! See, I told you.
 There's no real America.
 You shut that dog rectum you call a mouth! Yes, sir.
 Why are you people laughing at this? You're supposed to be better, nicer.
 But you're terrible.
 You're all terrible.
 Just like the people in New York.
 All God's children are terrible.
 Terrible, huh? I got a question for you there, pal.
 Do you ever find smaller heads orbiting your head? Is that a comment about the size of my head? I'm a tall man.
 And it's proportional to my frame.
 Your frame? What are they building there? A Super Walmart? You come down here and say that.
 I can't.
 I got a man's arm stuck up me.
 But you know what that's like.
 I can't believe I bought a submarine sandwich franchise! You look so much bigger up close! The deal's off, Wayne.
 Lemon? To the Kia Sorrento! Tray, get down here! I can't, I don't want to die! All right! What's wrong, Ken? That hatchet isn't real, is it? I wish, my meemaw just called.
 Pumpkin, western Georgia's most beloved ventriloquist doll, has died.
 That's three! Tell my wife I went to Philadelphia on business! Yeah!   

                




                    			So we're agreed.
 Assuming nothing goes wrong in the next eight hours, Jayden Michael Tyler will be the next T.
G.
 S.
 Cast member.
 Eight cities, 40 comics, one slap fight with a T.
S.
A.
 Agent.
 I'm done.
 Jayden's the one.
 Now we just have to make Jack think that hiring Jayden was his decision.
 Who are the decoys we will be using for the audition? A middle-aged female comic with a bolo tie.
 A one-man band who only plays Halloween music.
 And Australia's Jackie Mason.
 Jack will hate all of them and pick Jayden.
 I hate doing this to people.
 They all think this is their big break, but we're just using them.
 I call it the Hornberger System.
 You've never been on the other side of this, Pete.
 Auditioning is hard.
 So much rejection.
 Elizabeth Lemon.
 I am represented by Suzanne's B-Plus Talent.
 "My carpets need a deep clean.
" Next! And then, you call your mom and tell her, "It went great," and you've got a really good feeling about this year.
 I know it's not fun, but you are making this guy's dreams come true.
 At your age, it's probably the last time you'll ever make a man happy.
 That's true.
 Liz is old.
 Uh, where are we on this audition? Uh, we've narrowed it down to four people for this afternoon.
 I'm already not liking some of these people.
 It reminds me of being on the bus.
 Hey, come on, guys, these are people up here, with feelings and mothers who worry about them.
 Lemon, stop right there.
 You are on top of the pyramid.
 T.
G.
 S.
 Is a small pyramid, which nevertheless, will one day be your tomb.
 You can't let emotions distract you from making decisions about the slaves who built the pyramid which, again, will one day be your tomb.
 Jeez, sorry I'm not a robot.
 We all are.
 But we're getting there.
 In 10 years, this will all be the size of a microchip.
 Until then, you're in charge.
 Think like a robot.
 Be logical and dispassionate.
 Are you okay? See, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
 Human empathy.
 It's as useless as the Winter Olympics.
 This February, on N.
B.
C.
 Tracy, I just heard they're closing down the set today.
 Do you think it's for auditions? Jennifer M.
, why are you so worked up? Because it's going to be a disaster.
 Like Katrina.
 Do you remember Katrina? That crazy girl from hair and makeup? Nothing's going to change.
 They're going to hire some skinny, white guy.
 How is that a threat? You'll do your lady characters, and I will get on stage and people will laugh even when I forget my, um my line? Lines.
 Everybody's a threat, Tracy.
 You don't know who's going to walk through that door.
 It's true.
 Anything can happen in the audition process.
 Oh, yeah, I forgot, Dotcom.
 You know everything about acting because you played a bird in some stupid school play.
 Yes, Tracy, I was Trigorin in The Seagull on the Wesleyan ArtSpace main stage.
 He will know.
 Vampyr! Are they closing the stage this afternoon for auditions? What's on that piece of paper? Uh, Miss Lemon did say, "Keep this away from Jenna.
" But she may have meant the Jenna that works downstairs at that luggage store.
 So I'm going to give it to you.
 Thank you, Kenneth.
 Oh, my, sir.
 Looks like you've got a bad case of the "chewdaddies".
 Ozark kisses? The Woodsman's Companion? Bedbugs.
 They're a big problem in New York right now.
 I don't have bedbugs, Kenneth, I went to Princeton.
 Sir, anyone can get them.
 Back in Stone Mountain, even the mayor had bedbugs.
 And she was a horse.
 I'm sorry.
 Am I interrupting? Uh Uh Uh no, Breckman, it's nothing.
 It's not nothing, sir.
 Mr.
 Donaghy's got Blue Ridge quilt ticklers.
 Oh, sorry bedbugs.
 Bedbugs? Can't those live in your clothes? That's true, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 The mayor had to burn all her pantsuits.
 Don't worry about it, Breckman.
 I'll see you at the Business Development meeting at 11:00? You know what? Um, we may not need you for that.
 So I'm going to go now.
 Hey, what's up, Dotcom? "The Great Uta Hagen once said is why I'd like to audition for T.
G.
S.
" Walter, you idiot, you lost a card.
 Wait, you want to audition? Oh, Dotcom, I think you're great.
 But, no, I'm sorry, You can't.
 "I thank you for treating my request with respect.
" Liz, I need to speak with you.
 Beat it, Grizz or Dotcom.
 I saw your audition list.
 What? No, I told Kenneth to Luggage store Jenna.
 What are our options besides Jayden Michael Tyler? A lot of good people.
 You're setting him up to get it.
 Wait, you don't think I know that trick? You don't think I've been brought in on a million auditions just to make Kim Cattrall seem grounded and human? Yes, fine, we're stacking the deck for Jayden.
 Let me guess what your problem is with him.
 He's a talented actor and you're threatened by that.
 No, I know him, Liz.
 We did a play together 20 years ago, and we were best friends.
 Until he betrayed me.
 Hey, Jenna, congratulations on your nomination For Worst Supporting Bra! What play is that? I will not allow this to happen.
 Ugh, this process is painful enough without you adding your crazy to it.
 Too late! I'm getting that hot feeling in my head! Hey, Mom, it's Walter.
 I'm just calling to tell you they cancelled the audition so maybe pray on something else.
 You can audition! I'll need a piano.
 What is this? It's Cisco equipment, sir.
 It's almost better than being there.
 Is this because of my bedbugs? I will not be ostracized like this.
 Jack, bedbugs have become an epidemic in New York.
 I just think that everyone would feel more comfortable if you stayed in your office.
 Do you like the Cisco equipment? Of course.
 It continues to be the gold standard by which all business technology is judged.
 Cisco, The human network.
 This is what happens when you live north of 62nd street.
 You think I didn't hear that? I can hear your hair growing on this thing.
 You are discriminating against me.
 I am a human being.
 Did you just mute me? Did you just use Cisco's cutting-edge "SureMute" technology to mute me? Guys, we've got to have a united front.
 Bart said that if we didn't go in there with the numbers all set I'm going to come to your house and crawl into your bed and I'm going to bite you on the ass! Do you hear me? What do you mean, Dotcom is auditioning? How dumb are you? Is there anything in there? Pete, stop it.
 never closed.
 I tried to be strong, but I just couldn't tell him no.
 And now, I don't have to, see? Because we are making it Jack's decision.
 We were.
 But now you've compromised the Hornberger System.
 It's four people for a reason.
 The first guy, Jack's settling in.
 The second, he hates.
 The third is Jayden.
 The fourth proves how good Jayden is.
 The more people you add, the less effective it is.
 Like a neighborhood dad garage band.
 Come on, it's just Dotcom.
 It won't be.
 Because this is what you're doing.
 I'm driving a bus? No, you're opening the floodgates.
 With a horizontal wheel? Floodgate wheels are horizontal.
 It was all under control.
 Now everyone's going to want in, and we can't stop them.
 Hey, what the frak, nerds? Pete told me you were only looking at outside people.
 Now Dotcom's auditioning? Frank, I know you're a stand-up, but No "but".
 I want in.
 And I'm not changing my act to fit your stupid show.
 Mm-hmm.
 Liz, there you are.
 I heard about this whole Dotcom thing.
 I'm not saying I want to audition, but Nicky Matarullo from Scotch Plains, New Jersey, might be interested.
 Hey, forget about it.
 Actor emergency! Where? Here! Pete and Liz want to hire this guy, Jayden.
 He's evil, Tracy.
 He's Evil Tracy? Oh, he's "evil," comma, "Tracy".
 Go on.
 Pete and Liz are rigging it to make sure he gets the job.
 Do you know who else they're auditioning? A one-man band, some old Australian, Dotcom Dotcom? Oh, no.
 I once saw that guy become Trigorin at the Wesleyan Art Space.
 That guy is good.
 I can't compete with him.
 Okay, then we have to make sure neither one of them gets the job by finding better actors ourselves.
 Good idea, let's go.
 Call my car.
 I need to go to the dermatologist.
 I'm sorry, sir.
 But until you get this bedbug situation fixed, they don't want you using your company car.
 In fact, they suggested you take a taxicab.
 Oh, why are you scratching? You have Mugabe's Concubines! No, bedbugs! Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
 I'm sorry to bother you.
 My name is Jack.
 And I have bedbugs.
 I'm not a drug addict.
 I'm an executive with the General Electric Corporation, and I just need to get my medicine.
 If someone could tell me how to transfer to the Four train, I would be very grateful to you for your help.
 God bless you, and have a good day.
 Happy? No, not since I was a child.
 What is Kathy Geiss doing here? Her father heard about Brian Williams and insisted she get a chance.
 There's too many people here for the Hornberger System, Liz.
 What if Jack actually picks one of these weirdos? Did you know the Australian Jackie Mason was chemically castrated by his government? Liz, Pete.
 Jayden, you made it.
 So, uh This is my competition, huh? Kathy, no! Bad! Sorry, it's a little crazy here today.
 Are you kidding? I'm just happy to be here.
 This is corny, but will you take a picture of me in front of the T.
G.
 S.
 Sign? Yes, of course.
 Thanks, maybe this will convince my mom to stop sending me law school applications.
 My mom used to send me articles about how older virgins are considered good luck in Mexico.
 Okay, well, I'll see you on stage.
 I can't believe this is happening.
 Okay, this may be a train wreck, but that is the body that we need to pull out of it.
 All right, I'll rethink the system and try to make it work.
 Hey, at least we know it can't get any worse.
 If you are a funny gay man, please get into the car.
 I repeat, all funny gays into the car.
 I'm not gay, I'm "bi-larious"! Black people I know I have said some terrible things about you in print.
 But I come here today on a mission of peace.
 We need the funniest fool here to step forward.
 Kolandra! Kolandra! Kolandra, Kolandra, Kolandra, Kolandra! That'll work.
 Good luck on your audition.
 You're going to get it.
 Don't jinx me.
 Walter, you're going to get it.
 I made you something.
 It's a seagull.
 Oh, Mr.
 Donaghy Did they make you ride the freight elevator? I walked in your shoes today, Kenneth.
 I don't think you did, sir.
 I've just got the one pair, and I sleep in them.
 I fell to the bottom of the pyramid today.
 Cast out of society like a leper.
 No one will look at me, let alone touch me.
 But you will, won't you? Make me feel human again.
 Embrace me, Kenneth.
 I've got a thing.
 Et tu, Kenneth? It's just a math equation, that's all.
 Just okay.
 We put two women in a row like Who the hell are they? These are some actors we found driving all over this amazing, vibrant city.
 And this is a reimbursement form for my gas.
 I drove a million miles.
 Look, I don't know how you dragged this idiot in on your paranoia.
 Paranoia? Where? But you are not taking away the one good thing that I get out of this miserable process.
 If you're talking about hiring Jayden, you're insane.
 Just call anyone he's ever worked with.
 I did.
 I called every one of his references and they are impressive.
 A commercial with Martin Scorsese.
 An off-Broadway play with Christopher Walken.
 He's even studying the Meisner Technique with Sir Gilbert Gottfried.
 And they all said the same thing.
 All right.
 Let me tell you one thing about Jayden.
 I love Jayden.
 I love Jayden.
 I love Jayden.
 Was describing your sandwich necessary to our understanding of what happened? None of your actors are auditioning.
 The Hornberger System will prevail.
 Think again, Liz.
 The Hornberger System will "devail".
 Is that the opposite of prevail? I hoped it wouldn't come to this.
 But now I have to ruin Jayden psychologically.
 Tell me more.
 I'm going to walk up to him and say the four most vicious words you can say to a person you've already met.
 "Nice to meet you.
" And that freaks people out, huh? This is a learning and friendship adventure.
 Lemon, are you ready to get started? Yes, I just need one minute to send some of these people home.
 Really? You're just going to kick all of them to the curb like so much human garbage? Why are you being so cold and dispassionate? What? Because you told me to.
 And you just blindly do whatever I say? What are you, a robot? You also told me to be a robot.
 What is going on with you? I have bedbugs.
 And these bedbugs have chewed the blinders off my eyes.
 These are all people, Lemon.
 With feelings.
 Ugh! And they all get a chance.
 They all get to audition.
 Anyone who wants to audition, just give your name to Pete.
 Anthony DeCicco.
 I'll need an Obama wig.
 Frank Rossitano.
 Queens, New York.
 I guess dreams can come true.
 So last weekend, I was at the mall.
 But then, I went to the beach with my niece's friend, and then, I at the pool party.
 Mm-hmm! For my first character, I'd like to do an old janitor who's finally had enough and stabs everybody.
 Hello, I'm Jenna Maroney.
 Hi, I'm Jayden, nice to meet you.
 How dare you pretend you don't remember me! I'm the one who doesn't remember you! Josh Girard, former T.
G.
 S.
 Cast member.
 Then some movie work that didn't pan out.
 Then my agent dropped me.
 Then a web short.
 Where they made me do guy-guy stuff.
 Oh, God, forgive me.
 I call this character Smelly Belly.
 Good evening.
 We are Laugh of the Mohicans.
 Our first bit is the Hamburglar.
 No! Toofer and Lutz didn't tell me they were going to go together.
 This throws off the whole system.
 I've got to find one more.
 Hey, Dotcom, nice to meet you.
 Why would he say that to me? Have you ever wondered what happens in the refrigerator after the light goes off? Does the milk say, "Let's go down to the crisper drawer and make trouble"? I don't know.
 Forget about it.
 You want to be on a T.
V.
 Show? Okay, come on.
 Come on, come on.
 Growing up in Bed-Stuy, there was a certain music to the way people talked.
 "Hey, Papi, what you doing?" I'm sorry.
 Can I start over? Someone really messed with my head right before I came on.
 # I dreamed that love would never die # # I dreamed that God would be forgiving # Okay, here we go, you can do it.
 Hi, I'm Jayden Michael Tyler.
 My first piece will be a dinner party at Martin Scorsese's house with Christopher Walken and Gilbert Gottfried.
 What? Thank you for inviting us, Martin.
 I brought wine! Son of a bitch.
 I was talking to you on the phone, wasn't I? What? Give it up.
 I've figured out your game.
 Congratulations, your show is so stupid, I thought you would be too.
 I can't believe I went through all of this for you.
 I fought for you, Jayden.
 And now, I'm going to have to start all over.
 No, you don't.
 You're giving me the job no matter what.
 Because your fingerprints are all over my camera.
 So? So, you said you'd only hire me if I let you take pictures of my genitals.
 Oh, no! What is wrong with them? Jenna was right.
 You're totally crazy.
 Would a crazy person laugh like this? You can use the regular elevators around the corner.
 You're the one who's human here.
 Well said.
 Jenna, you're right.
 He's crazy, we can't hire him.
 Who, Brian Williams? No, Jayden.
 I'm sorry I doubted you.
 It's just that you've never been right before.
 About anything.
 I know.
 I've got to find Jack.
 Tell him we didn't find anyone and we have to start over.
 My two cents? I liked the janitor.
 I'd never been to an audition before.
 It was upsetting.
 A grotesque carnival of human misery.
 To be fair, I did not think Kathy Geiss was going to finish her song by taking off her underpants.
 However, the process was a pleasant reminder that some of us are, in fact, better than others.
 There was one clear standout, in my opinion.
 No, I know, he was my favorite too.
 But we can't, he's crazy.
 We have to start over.
 All actors are crazy, Lemon.
 And the more talented they are, the crazier they are.
 I mean, look at Jenna and Tracy.
 They handed in a check request form for $600,000 worth of gas.
 Your job is to manage the crazy and bring out the talent.
 Crazy is one thing.
 He's a psychopath.
 You're wrong.
 He's a good person.
 And this conversation is over.
 We're hiring the robot.
 The robot is the guy that you like? And you think he's the best because Because he was the only one of them, the only person in New York who would shake the hand of a man with bedbugs.
 Lemon, we're not just hiring an actor.
 We're hiring a co-worker, a human being.
 And I say we hire the one who lives by the Code of the Robot.
 Care.
 Love.
 Live.
 Okay, so instead of starting from scratch, we are hiring the robot.
 On the show.
 To act.
 Boy, I hope he speaks English.
 Yikes.
 # This little light of mine, Lord # # I'm going to let it shine # # Oh, this little light of mine, Lord # # I'm going to let it shine # # This little light of mine, Lord # # I'm going to let it shine # # Every day, every day, let it shine # # Every day, every day, I'm going to let it shine # # Oh, every day, every day, I'm going to let it shine # # Dum-da-do-do # # Every day, every day, I'm going to let it shine # # Every day, every day, let it shine #   

                




                    			Hey, Jack.
 Lemon, I was in Beijing this weekend buying a reality show format where criminals try to dance their way to freedom.
 I also bought this.
 A Chinese knockoff of your book.
 What? The Book for You Man No Good.
 "By Lesbian Yellow-Sour-Fruit.
" So, uh, what do you need from me? Ah, well, our new cast member starts today.
 Oh, of course, the robot, I liked him.
 We don't know anything about him.
 I don't think his real name is Partybot.
 I don't know what he looks like.
 I don't know what he talks like.
 I certainly don't know if he can act.
 Uh, Lemon, what did you once say to me about acting? Just hit your marks, stay in your light, and do the same thing every take for continuity.
 See, anyone can do it.
 Miss Lemon, security called.
 Our new actor just checked in.
 He'll be on six in a couple minutes.
 Let's go introduce ourselves.
 This is so exciting! Maybe we should practice the welcome song I distributed.
 # Making a new friend sure ain't easy # # And that's how two become one # Uh, Lemon, do you have any plans for dinner tonight? I do, I bought an Activia microwaveable panini.
 Good God, have dinner with me.
 Just the two of us? Yes.
 Okay.
 Hey, Jackie D, I hope the new dude isn't impossible to work with, like some people I know.
 I hope he's educated.
 I hope he hates Toofer.
 I hope he likes janitor hugs.
 Somebody's coming! Oh, no, is that the new guy? What? No, it's me Lutz.
 I've worked here for three years.
 I gave you that car I won.
 Come on.
 Hi, I think I'm supposed to be on T.
 V? Jack Donaghy.
 Good to see you again.
 Oh, hey, I'm Jack Baker.
 So I guess there's two Jacks here now.
 I don't think there are.
 Welcome aboard Danny.
 Hi, Danny, I'm Liz.
 Did he just change my name? Let's go look at your dressing room.
 Danny.
 He looks like all the guys in my magazines.
 This is unbelievable.
 Last week, I was just a street performer making $50 a day and getting memory loss from all the silver paint fumes.
 And now, I'm, um You're on T.
G.
 S.
 I'm on T.
G.
 S? This is unbelievable! I haven't done any real acting since I was in that high school football movie back in Ottawa.
 You're Canadian? All right, hosers.
 I want all 12 of us fighting for every meter on all three downs.
 And we're going to make this a Boxing Day the Prime Minister will never forget.
 Okay, well, you don't have zero experience.
 I just don't want to screw up.
 Like, what do you wish you'd known on your first day here? Oh, well, don't eat prop food.
 They spray something on it that messes you up.
 Hello, Mr.
 Baker.
 I'm Kenneth, one of the N.
B.
C.
 Pages.
 I'm going out to get Miss Maroney and Mr.
 Jordan's lunch.
 And what would you like? Oh, thanks, I'll probably just go grab something later.
 Can I get you anything while I'm out? Okay, here's one.
 You can have the powers of Superman for an entire year.
 But you can only have one sexual partner for the rest of your life.
 Two questions.
 Must I live by Superman's moral code? And will the sex woman get older? Yes and yes.
 Forget it, no deal.
 Hey.
 I don't want your sleeve to catch on fire.
 Why would my sleeve catch on fire? Ah.
 You know me well, sir.
 I often know what you're going to do before you do it.
 What am I going to do next? Speaking of which, I made some calls.
 And there's interest in a Dealbreakers talk show.
 With you hosting.
 Spit take, are you serious? Absolutely, you're becoming a commodity.
 I say we book the studio, shoot the pilot and take it from there.
 What do you think? Wow, okay, let's do it.
 I knew you would say yes, Lemon.
 Hey, Pete.
 I have a question.
 Is "camera left" my left or my right? Here's some advice, Danny.
 Learn as little as you can.
 'Cause when you know things, people ask you to do things.
 And then, everyone starts coming to you with their problems.
 That's why, when someone comes to me with something I don't want to deal with, I say, "Oh, no, my kid's sick," and take off.
 Do you have any kids? No.
 I mean, I pretty much raised my little sister 'cause my mom worked nights.
 That must have been hard.
 Oh, no, my kid is sick.
 A Dealbreakers talk show? That's amazing, Liz.
 Liz Lemon, you are blowing up like a balloon with a grenade in it.
 Who else are you meeting with? What do you mean? Well, you know, like producers and agents.
 No on, I'm doing it with Jack, for Sheinhardt-Universal.
 Liz, you can't just go with the first person who comes along.
 I know, because I've been burned.
 Do you remember when I was first starting out and I signed a 10-year deal with that karaoke machine company? When I first got big, I made bad business decisions too.
 Which is how I got stuck having to plug Wade Boggs' Carpet World five times whenever I appear onscreen.
 You have to plug what? Wade Boggs' Carpet World.
 Wade Boggs' Carpet World.
 Wade Boggs' Carpet World.
 Liz, Jack would never take a first offer, right? He's taking advantage of your relationship.
 He knows you're special.
 Like a black stripper with blue eyes.
 You have to test the marketplace.
 But I already told Jack that I would do it with him.
 Did you sign anything? Then he'll understand.
 It's business.
 I'm going to set you up with someone at my agency and make sure that you do this right.
 And one last piece of advice, Liz Lemon, from someone who's been on this side of the business for a long time.
 Wade Boggs' Carpet World.
 That was actually good advice.
 From now on, I shall call us the Problem Solvers.
 Yo, Ken.
 Do you have a problem that needs solving? Actually, I do.
 Mr.
 Baker wants to do everything for himself.
 I feel about as useless as a mom's college degree.
 Sounds like a job for the Problem Solvers.
 We'll talk to Danny for you.
 Lemon, I was just going to call you.
 The guy who came up with this thing for Arsenio Hall wants to create a signature arm gesture for our talk show.
 I was thinking something like this.
 Unh-uh.
 Unh-uh.
 Um, yeah, about the talk show.
 While I am very thankful for your offer, I think I maybe should take a couple other meetings before committing to anything.
 Like you said, I'm a commodity now.
 My book is number 14 on the nonfiction bestseller chart right behind The Founding Fathers' Diet.
 So I'm signing with an agent and exploring my options.
 I see.
 Well, if that's how you feel about it, good luck in the marketplace.
 Obviously, this is nothing personal.
 I just want to be thorough.
 That's okay, right? All right, then, great meeting.
 Raise your hand if you're cool with what's happening.
 Not too late to raise your hand.
 Cerie, if you need me, I'll be at a meeting with my new agent.
 Oh, he called to confirm your lunch, but I told him you'd already eaten a weird panini.
 That was no.
 Just call him and tell him I'm on my way.
 Do I look okay? That's exactly how you look.
 Hi.
 There she is.
 The Dealbreaker.
 Simon Barrons.
 You're an agent? A junior agent.
 Um Uh Full disclosure.
 Until now, I've mainly represented dogs.
 But seeing as how we're both embarking on a new phase in our career, performing, representing humans and monkeys I want you to know that I'm hungry and I would do anything for you.
 My clients are more important to me than my own mommy.
 Okay, good.
 I need someone that I can count on.
 I'm kind of alone out here in the marketplace.
 I get it, I get it.
 That's what I'm here for.
 Um Okay, let's get your face out there and take some meetings.
 There's Jack "Donahee" at N.
B.
C.
 Donaghy.
 Already met, who else? Do you know who Scottie Shofar is? Oh, yeah, he's the guy that produces that dumb sports show that always beats us.
 Yeah, you're talking about Sports Shouting.
 Okay, let's meet with him.
 Absolutely.
 Now, I don't know him, but a former client of mine once buried a bone in his backyard.
 We go looking for that bone, and it's like, "Oh, Mr.
 Shofar.
 What's up? My client has got an idea for a talk show.
" Oh, no, I've got the hiccups.
 Danny, around here we're known as the Problem Solvers.
 Always have been, always will be.
 And we think you could use a little guidance.
 Yes, please.
 I don't even know where the bathrooms are around here.
 It's not about the room, Danny.
 It's about the man.
 Any room you see around here with a door, you make it your bathroom.
 You're an actor now, you're special.
 And taking advantage of Kenneth is part of it.
 It's what he's here for.
 Look, I'm just trying to keep my head down and suppress my Canadian accent.
 I'm not "aboat" to "a-boat" "ab-wahout".
 All I'm saying is that I don't want to rub anyone the wrong way.
 Even Kenneth.
 Oh, don't worry.
 Kenneth loves being our slave.
 He may say that.
 But trust me, it's not true.
 I was an assistant once.
 And when you're in that position, you grow resentful and bitter.
 So what if Kenneth is bitter? He's an "Underhuman".
 Look, a couple days ago, I was working as a robot for spare change.
 And now, look at me.
 Kenneth's a page.
 But who knows? Someday, he could be running the network.
 What? That's ridiculous.
 Crazier things have happened.
 Kenneth in charge? Liz Here are today's press clippings.
 Women's Health magazine gave us a D-minus.
 Son of a bitch.
 "Sheinhardt-Universal announces production of a Dealbreakers talk show.
" What the what, Jack? Let me explain something to you, Lemon.
 Dealbreakers is a sketch that first appeared on this network.
 We own it.
 And we are doing it, whether or not you're involved.
 Really? So you think you can just replace me.
 Of course not, we can do better.
 I've already spoken to Padma Lakshmi.
 Then who's going to host Top Chef? You are ruining my life.
 Or we could just do the show with you.
 But that door is closing.
 Close it.
 You think you can bully me like this? Well, you don't know me.
 Two can play at this game, Jack.
 Gah! Ken, you don't want to be a page forever.
 Who said I've been alive forever? What? No, I mean, what's your dream job? Where do you see yourself in 10 years? Well, you know how much I love television, sir.
 So I guess my dream would be to one day run the network.
 Just kidding.
 There won't be a network.
 But whatever people are watching, I want to be in charge of it.
 So someday, you could be my boss.
 Well, I guess so.
 Now are you ready to get started? No, I'll brush my own teeth.
 Now I don't want you to have any resentments towards me.
 From now on, I don't want you to do anything for me.
 Hey, Jack, two days until the show, and I still don't really know anything.
 I'll tell you everything you need to know, Danny.
 Never do business with a friend.
 Never be friends with a woman.
 And lose the leather bracelet.
 Pete, I have a problem, I need your help.
 Oh, my kid got hit by a car! Hey, Jackie D, what's wrong? You're not your usual, giggly self.
 If you've got a problem, you've found the right people.
 Okay, I have a problem.
 It needs to be communicated to Lemon that if she wants to play business, I'm more than happy to play with her.
 But as she saw earlier today, Business Jack does not play gentle.
 Are you as turned on as I am right now? Lemon has a decision to make.
 She can either be crushed by me or she can suck in her stomach and crawl back through the tiny crack I have left for her in the proverbial door.
 You think you can pass that along? Uh-huh.
 Wait, hang on.
 Our t-shirts are wrong.
 Do you want to switch where we're standing, or switch our t-shirts? Just to be safe, let's do both.
 Really, he said, "crawl back"? You're not really capturing the sexual energy of it, but that was the message.
 So problem solved? I haven't even begun to problem.
 We are suing Jack Donaghy and N.
B.
C.
 For the rights to Dealbreakers.
 Would either of you care for a drink? Do you have drinkable yogurt? Simon, we're both men of the world.
 Yeah, I've seen some bras.
 I bet you have.
 Here's the thing.
 No one is suing anyone.
 Don't let him push you around.
 I'm not, God.
 Leave me alone.
 N.
B.
C.
 Employs 80 percent of your agency's clients.
 Between Are You Stronger than a Dog? And I'm a Celebrity Dog, Get Me Out 'Arf Here, you need us.
 I've already talked to your lawyers, and they're not interested in pursuing this.
 God, Jack.
 Why are you being such a wang about this? I'll take that as a compliment.
 An Wang, the founder of Wang Computers, was one of the great businessmen of the 20th century.
 And you're the one being a lowercase "wang", Lemon.
 Because, after working with me every day for four years, you didn't trust me to produce your show.
 Instead, you made it about business.
 And I didn't get a bathroom door that looks like part of the wall by being bad at business.
 That's a bathroom? You tried to take advantage of our friendship to make money.
 I don't need you to make money.
 In fact, I'm meeting with your replacement tonight.
 Yeah, well, I'm replacing you too.
 Because I've got all kinds of meetings lined up.
 Big meetings.
 Really, with who? Damn it, Simon! You were right about Jack.
 He's in love with me? What? No, he burned me on Dealbreakers.
 And now, I need to find someone to help me burn him back.
 Well, I could introduce you to my boy, Scottie Shofar.
 You know him? Hell, yeah.
 I'm a frequent guest on Sports Shouting.
 Nah, introducing you to Scottie probably wouldn't solve your problems with Jack.
 Jack who? Set it up.
 Scottie Shofar, I know that name.
 What does he look like? I don't know.
 All white people look the same to me, Pete.
 Oh, my God.
 Scottie Shofar was my assistant The Movie.
 I was horrible to him.
 And now, he's actually successful? What if I got called in to audition for him and he recognized me? Even with all the changes to my face that have happened naturally.
 That's what Danny was saying.
 We have to be cool to everybody.
 Because the future is like a Japanese game show.
 You have no idea what's going on.
 Miss Maroney, your Mexican diet pills came.
 Should I start taking them to test their side effects? No, Kenneth, I'll do it myself.
 You don't have to do anything for me anymore.
 Ever.
 What is happening around here? What has changed? We're "a-boat" to get married.
 Ugh, that's not right.
 Mr.
 Baker, we need to talk.
 Now's not a great time, Kenneth.
 I don't need anything.
 Sir, this time, I need something from you.
 You've poisoned Mr.
 Jordan's and Miss Maroney's minds.
 You've got to tell them to go back to the way it was.
 To let me help everyone again, including you.
 Kenneth, I don't Yes, you do.
 Because you're scared and frustrated.
 Of course I am.
 Because I'm going on T.
V.
 Tomorrow and I don't know what I'm doing.
 Yes, embrace your anger.
 What? You know, of all the weirdos I've met around here, you're the worst.
 With your creepy, Don Knotts face, that ridiculous Hitler Youth haircut Excellent.
 What about my chin? What about your chin, Kenneth? I've seen bigger chins on a premature baby! Mr.
 Baker, you just made me feel terrible and said the word "about" correctly.
 Congratulations, you're an actor.
 About.
 About.
 Oh, my God.
 Thank you, Kenneth.
 That was "a-boot" the coolest thing I've ever seen.
 How long have you been there? A few minutes.
 Nine hours.
 Well, you need to know something too.
 No matter what happens in the future, I will always take care of you.
 Kenneth's the best.
 He knows what I want before I do.
 Who's hungry? I wanted waffles.
 Yay! So you can have all the powers of Superman for an entire year, but Superman? I've done hot yoga with Tom Welling and Dean Cain, and I don't think they're right for this.
 No, I wasn't, um Sorry, I've got to take this.
 What's up? Nothing, just meeting with this Dealbreakers lady.
 I don't know.
 Regular six, drunk seven.
 Padma, I'm so happy you've taken an interest in Dealbreakers.
 I love doing Top Chef.
 But this would give me a chance to showcase my other talents.
 I mean, men always tell me I'm very funny.
 Ah.
 Have you heard this one? Knock, knock.
 We don't even care about the profits from your actual show.
 That's nothing to us.
 That's our Snapple money.
 See, we're all about monetizing you as a brand.
 Oh, I'm blowing up.
 It's Rahm Emanuel.
 He wants me to go to Deer Valley.
 I am crushing it! Yeah, because I'm really looking for a partner in this.
 Someone I can trust.
 So I would be a full partner in this with you? That's what I'm looking for, yes.
 I like it.
 You know, I'm very entrepreneurial.
 I invented this new bag that you put around a sandwich to keep it fresh.
 But it's clear.
 So you still get the full visual of the sandwich.
 Uh, so, it's a sandwich bag.
 No, Jack.
 It's a new thing that I invented.
 Ah.
 The point is, we do business together, and you are my number one priority.
 Nothing is more important to me than you.
 I've got to take this.
 It's Brooke Hogan.
 What's up, you tall drink of bitch? You're amazing.
 No, seriously.
 Amazing.
 Uh-huh.
 Yeah, you heard me.
 Yeah, that's right.
 Yeah.
 No, seriously.
 So what would my time commitment be if I host this thing? Uh, honestly, two days a week.
 Wow, that's great.
 Top Chef has all this traveling and all-day shoots.
 If I could do this instead, I wouldn't be so grouchy and exhausted all the time.
 My clothes wouldn't have food stains all over them.
 I could actually find a balance between my work and being a mommy.
 This would change my life, Jack.
 It would.
 It would change your life.
 So let's do this.
 No.
 What? I don't want to change your life.
 I want to change Lemon's life.
 I'm sorry.
 Ugh, this business is so hard! Not really.
 I'm kidding.
 Go, go.
 Lemon.
 Jack.
 I was wrong.
 It's you, it's always been you.
 I want to do business with you, Lemon.
 I'd like that.
 Do you have a problem? Then call the Problem Solvers.
 Taxes got you down? Wasps in your crawl space? Term paper blues? Migrating implants? Call the Problem Solvers.
 'Cause after all, what's a problem but an opportunity disguised as a stripper having a seizure on your boat? Mouse in your house? Or need a cheap flight to Tucson? # We are the Problem # # Solvers # That was a good rehearsal.
 Now let's record it.
 And we're rolling.
   

                




                    			And side.
 Excellent, keep those cores strong.
 Three.
 Two.
 Take it side.
 And side.
 Nice.
 This is a classic, pre-war one bedroom, one bath.
 What? Oh, the cleaning lady is here.
 Please come back later.
 No Polish.
 I live here.
 What are you doing? Oh, haven't you heard? The building's going condo.
 If you're planning on buying, I'm Wendy.
 We should talk.
 Well, I'm not buying, and they can't just kick me out.
 No, they can't, but they can hike your rent up.
 Way up.
 Let me show you the bedroom.
 Jack will tell you what to do next.
 What? Thanks, Cindy.
 All right.
 Now, we're going to work those glutes.
 Hey, do you have a minute? Good God, Lemon.
 Have you seen this? As I'm sure you've concluded from the headline, Don Geiss' estranged son, Bertram, is suing his half sister, Kathy, for control of the Geiss family trust fund.
 They could have done "Geiss-Scream Son-Pay"? You know, like ice cream sundae.
 This makes me sick to my stomach, Lemon.
 Don Geiss is my hero.
 My mentor.
 A great man.
 Holding up one finger to get someone to stop talking? He invented that.
 I don't think And now, he's being publicly humiliated by his own family.
 This is why I'm glad I never had children.
 And why I never will.
 Oh, Jack, you don't mean that.
 Geiss also invented the abrupt conversational segue.
 Talk about your thing now.
 Okay, well, um, my building is going condo.
 And they're trying to drive the renters out? Are you going to buy your place? Well, I love my building.
 But if I'm going to buy a place, it should be a big place where I can have a family.
 Then, spend some of your Dealbreakers money.
 Buy two apartments.
 What? You know why my place is so big? When I was first married to my ex-wife, we were in the basement.
 Over the years, I kept buying the floors above me to make room for the family I thought we'd have.
 Well, now I have something better than a family.
 A walk-in humidor, a lap pool, and a replica of the Irish pub where my grandmother was born.
 Well, I'm not rich, Jack.
 You're doing okay.
 And this could be your dream apartment.
 Sniff around your upstairs neighbor.
 See if he's planning to leave.
 If he's not, make him an offer he can't refuse.
 Trademark 1974.
 Don Geiss.
 What, like, bribe him? I know this sounds ugly, but with Manhattan real estate, there are no rules.
 It's like check-in at an Italian airport.
 Oh, my God.
 Frank, were you going to pee in that jar? I didn't know anyone was here.
 That's what you use the jars for? You told me that was sun tea.
 Some of them are sun tea.
 And some of them were sun tea.
 Ugh, what do you know about this? We have a gentleman's agreement.
 He gets the jars, and in return, he's agreed to let a Yale sweatshirt be our designated fart dampener.
 What is wrong with you guys? What would it be like if Cerie and Sue and I were not here? I'd take my pants off and eat chicken wings.
 Shut it down.
 Throw away the jars.
 Fine, but I'm going to recycle them.
 And then, one day, as you drink some apple juice, you'll wonder, "Where has this jar been?" I will fight my sister tooth and nail to get what I deserve.
 Because I, Bertram Geiss, am still Daddy's fancy boy.
 After the deposition, Kathy Geiss' lawyer offered this rebuttal.
 My name is Teddy Ruxpin.
 Can you and I be friends? Mr.
 Donaghy, you wanted to see me? Kenneth, I have a task for you.
 Is it menial? As part of N.
B.
C.
's annual Green Week initiative, T.
G.
 S.
 Has to reduce its carbon footprint.
 I'm putting you in charge of that effort.
 Global warming, sir? I'm sorry, that's just a bunch of scientist talk.
 Same people who'd have you believe that my great grandfather was a monkey.
 If he was a monkey, then why was he killed by a monkey? You're preaching to the choir, Kenneth.
 I mean, I love the earth.
 I have these rare Kadupul blossoms flown in every morning from Sri Lanka on a private jet.
 That's the definition of green.
 And yet, they force us to do more.
 More sacrifices.
 Why? For the children.
 What have children ever done for us? Well, they make our shoes and wallets.
 I need a five percent reduction of energy use across the board.
 I'll do it if you insist, sir.
 But I'm going to be grumpy until the end of this sentence.
 Hi, I'm Liz, and I live right below you.
 Oh, my God, I'm Brian.
 Come in.
 Wow, this place is great.
 Isn't it? New kitchen, original molding, and I have a view because that dentist blew up his townhouse.
 So you going to try and bribe me like the rest of these yuppie, bottom-feeders? What? No! Bribe, people do that? Yeah, well, the guy above me offered me $10,000 to move out.
 That's a lot.
 It's obscene.
 This neighborhood used to be real.
 Now it's all chain stores and fancy restaurants.
 Yeah, we cool people have got to hold our ground, fight the Man, Michael Moore, et cetera.
 Is that a working fireplace? Yeah, but it it's kind of annoying.
 I can't shut the flue, so the apartment smells like Burger King all day and Cinnabon all night.
 Yeah, I just came up here to make sure you're staying.
 Ruining things for those creeps who are trying to make duplexes for their imaginary children and their imaginary husband, Astronaut Mike Dexter.
 So what's your plan? I don't know, I'll just figure something out, I guess.
 Look, what if we team up? What do you mean? I can't afford to stay here on my own.
 And based on your shoes and teeth, I'm guessing you can't, either.
 So why don't we move in together? Uh-huh.
 I mean, you'd have to give up your place, 'cause this is the two bedroom.
 There's two of them? Oh! Is that bad? Oh, God.
 So now you're your own upstairs neighbor, what's the plan? Well, I'm going to pretend to move in with Brian, somehow drive him out, then buy both places and make my dream apartment.
 Wow, that sounds like something I'd come up with if I was smarter.
 I know, I'm terrible, but Brian sucks.
 He doesn't have a T.
V.
, and he wears political t-shirts.
 Don't feel guilty for a second.
 This is Manhattan real estate.
 There are no rules.
 Like check in at an Italian sex party.
 I mean, do you know how long I've been waiting for the lady next door to finally join her husband in hell? Hello, Mrs.
 Gerstein.
 Oh, my heart is getting stronger every day.
 Oh, you ancient bitch.
 You've already got a foot in the door.
 Here's what you're going to do.
 Do you remember that horrible roommate you had back in Chicago? You mean you? I know it's my turn to do the dishes.
 But I'm in character.
 And if you make me do the dishes, I will kill myself! You drove a lot of guys out of that third bedroom.
 Because guys hate drama.
 And I'm going to teach you how to be a drama queen.
 And if I fail, I'm going to take a bunch of pills, and it's going to be your fault! Still got it.
 Oh, Lemon.
 I just want to make sure you're not making any jokes about Don Geiss this week.
 Don't worry, Jack.
 Our topical cold open is about Omarosa borrowing Bjork's swan dress.
 Tracy? What's up, Donaghy? Tracy, Jr.
, to what do we owe this visit? It's "Take Your Black Kid to Work Day".
 Do you ever regret having children? Every day.
 I thought having a family was going to be like The Cosby Show.
 "Oh, no, Vanessa went to a concert.
" "Oh, no, Rudy and I are making a sandwich for 25 minutes.
" The Cosby Show was a lie.
 Having a family can be the worst.
 For example, I have this strip club story from this weekend I need to tell you, Jackie D.
 It is disgusting.
 But I can't, because I've got this little D-bag here.
 I know what that means.
 And yet, you won't tell me.
 I've been thinking a lot about family lately.
 About my legacy.
 I've been watching a friend go through an ordeal with his children, and it has only affirmed that I was not meant to have any of my own.
 And that I never will.
 It's not that simple.
 Now what if a girl tries to trap you like Nicole tried to do to me on the band trip? Bitches can be tricky.
 I'm going to get some strawberry milk.
 Tracy Jr.
 Is right.
 There's only one way to really take children off the table.
 I'm going to get a vasectomy.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 I mean, that's a big decision.
 I mean, having a family is also the best thing a man could He's gone.
 So my story.
 So I'm in the strip club with Charles Barkley and one of the Hobbits Hey, Daddy.
 Damn it, I can't live like this! I'm getting a vasectomy too! Excuse me, Miss Maroney? Kenneth, I'm doing my Kegels right now, what is it? Well, I've been put in charge of reducing T.
G.
S.
 's carbon footprint.
 And everyone has to chip in.
 Kenneth, I once took a low volume shower with Ed Begley Jr.
 What more can I do? Well, let's see.
 Minka Kelly says, "My show is about football.
 There is a football team called the Chargers.
 Unplug your chargers.
" But, Kenneth, I need all of these.
 This one is for my cell phone.
 This one is for my laptop.
 This one is for my erotic massager.
 And this one is for something personal.
 A vasectomy is a very serious decision.
 I want to make sure you've both thought this through.
 I have, I've thought about it, and I've decided I don't want to have children.
 Family planning.
 And what about you, Tracy? The Cosby Show lied to me.
 I don't think there's a box for that on the form.
 Uh, what about "Cheers' lied to me"? Okay.
 Now, for the procedure, you can choose between local or general anesthesia.
 I should warn you that general anesthesia can cause powerful hallucinations.
 So I highly recommend it.
 I'll schedule both of you for the morning.
 Now, this is surgery, so don't eat anything before you come in.
 Because I'll have a big breakfast waiting for you.
 Until tomorrow, gentlemen.
 We all see the little black boy in the corner, right? Okay.
 Whoo Hey, Liz.
 I made you a mailbox key.
 So is that all you have to say to to me? That's how you apologize? What, what did I do? What do you care? Whatever, Brian, I am over it! Over what? It! Oh, I'm sorry, is it too much drama? You remind me of my father and my boyfriend! Ugh, are you listening to me? Because if you're not, I will put on a wedding dress and jump in front of a subway! Honey, you don't need to tell me how much men suck.
 Sit down and tell me everything while I make us raspberry mojitos.
 You're gay? Start from the beginning.
 What's this boyfriend's name? Astronaut Mike Dexter.
 Hi, Tracy.
 I thought Take Your Black Kid to Work Day was yesterday.
 No, it's always a Wednesday.
 Brian is gay, Jenna.
 The drama did not make him want to move out.
 Well, of course not.
 Drama is like gay man Gatorade.
 It replenishes their electrolytes.
 Damn it, he's never going to leave.
 Trying to get someone to move out? May I suggest what got my neighbors to move out? Black person moved in, scared them off.
 Huh, that's not a bad idea, Tracy.
 I've got a lot of good ideas.
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to take my son to my vasectomy because The Cosby Show lied to me and I cannot tell an amazing strip club story.
 Okay, let's go.
 Miss Lemon, as I'm sure you know, it is Green Week.
 And N.
B.
 C Oh, brother, are they actually going to do something this year? Or are they just going to put that stupid green peacock in the corner of the screen? Actually, we're reducing T.
G.
S.
 's carbon footprint.
 And what you can do, Miss Lemon, get rid of your office minifridge.
 My mini-fridge? What about my fresh fruit flavored toaster cheesecakes? Oh, So I guess you can make other people give stuff up, But you're too good to make a sacrifice yourself.
 Fine, I'll give up my minifridge.
 Because, unlike Frank, I am a good and decent person.
 Is that my cell phone? Oh, no, sorry.
 It's in my hand.
 Count backwards from 10.
 Sure, I know how to do that.
 You lied to me, Bill Cosby! You lied to me! Uh-oh, here comes my hallucination.
 Denise? Vanessa? Sondra, the boring one? It's your father! I'm having a Cosby Show hallucination! Hey, Dad.
 Theo, what's going on here? Did Rudy make a mess with the juicer again? Vanessa was supposed to be watching her, and not upstairs gossiping on the phone.
 Who are Rudy and Vanessa? Your adorable sister and your sister.
 I don't have any sisters, Dad.
 It's just us guys.
 And you know how it is when it's just us guys, right? That's why my life is not like The Cosby Show.
 I only have boys.
 And boys are disgusting! I need a baby girl.
 Don't patronize me! Stop laughing! It's not funny! I need a baby girl! Don't slit my vas deferens! Looking things! Hey, what are you doing home? Oh, just getting my computer.
 Sorry, I forgot you'd be home now, Brian! Elizabeth? I know you're in there! Oh, no, it's my crazy, black boyfriend, Astronaut Mike Dexter.
 You better not be with a man, even if he's gay! Mike, no.
 I don't even know why I'm letting you in when you're in this unreasonable state.
 Don't get angry and jealous even though Brian is the one who convinced me to move on.
 I'm going to be coming by all the time, getting jealous, taking things out of context.
 That dude, Brian, would be happier moving out! Okay, everybody just calm down.
 I feel angry! Like Warren Moon must have felt back in 1995! As I have told you many times during our relationship, no one gets that reference.
 Oh, Lord! N.
Y.
P.
D.
, stay on the ground! A gay, hipster cop.
 You're an interesting guy, Brian.
 I'm so sorry.
 Look at this.
 The Geiss name used to be synonymous with success, power, funny incidents where women died at barbecues.
 Now it's being dragged through the mud.
 This is why I'm having a vasectomy.
 Yeah, but look at that picture.
 He had some good times with his kids too.
 That junk is priceless.
 Well, I'm glad I'm doing this.
 Very, very glad.
 What are you working on now? I have to write an essay about my dad for school.
 I want the cover to be one of those things where each letter in his name stands for a word about him.
 That's called an acrostic.
 An acrostic, cool.
 Thanks for teaching me that.
 Yes, well, you're welcome.
 Uh, maybe I could help you with the grammar.
 Why don't you read it to me? "T" is for terrific.
 "R" is for rad.
 "A" is for awesome.
 "C" 'cause he's my dad.
 Damn you, Tracy Jr.
 Miss Lemon, your mini-fridge is still in your office.
 You made a promise to Masi Oka.
 "Conserve electricity.
 Don't be a zero.
 Be a good guy.
" Why doesn't that say "hero"? That feels like a real missed opportunity.
 I don't care.
 If I can't have my adult apartment, I will have my mini-fridge.
 Wow, Liz.
 Don't you care about the environment? Shut up, what do you know about the environment? Only everything.
 Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the greenest person at T.
G.
S.
, Mr.
 Frank Rossitano.
 What? He never wastes anything.
 I'v seen him eat food from the trash.
 What's a trash barrel but a big salad bowl filled with trash? He never wastes water by doing his laundry.
 This shirt started out white.
 No, do not encourage this.
 He pees in jars and leaves them around the office.
 That's a health hazard.
 Come, let me show you something.
 Don't talk to me like that.
 You look like a turtle who lost his shell.
 Mr.
 Rossitano has actually been emptying his jars.
 Out there.
 He's been pouring them out the window? Oh, that is beautiful.
 Miss Lemon, T.
G.
 S.
 Can reach its five percent goal in one of two ways.
 You can give up your mini-fridge.
 Or you can let Mr.
 Rossitano do his Sun Tea System.
 Just keep the door closed.
 Absolutely not.
 Wake up, Tracy! Wake up! I don't want a vasectomy, Dr.
 Spaceman.
 I need to go back in time.
 Why did I sell my DeLorean to Mr.
 T? Oh, you'll be fine, Tracy.
 I didn't let Leo go through with the vasectomy.
 If a patient's friend runs into the operating room and yells at you, you have to stop.
 It's the Doctor's Code.
 Jackie D, I need a baby girl! Maybe one day, our kids will play together.
 I didn't have my vasectomy, either.
 Tracy, I want to have children.
 I want those memories, no matter what the cost.
 And I have to pass on this head of hair.
 What made you change your mind? Tracy Jr.
 Made you an acrostic.
 Well, I hope he makes me an across helmet so I don't get hurt playing across.
 Now come on.
 That's pretty solid for a guy who just came out of a hallucination.
 Hey, how did everything go with Dotcom? Terrible, actually.
 Well, what are you going to do now? I give up.
 I can't Jack, Jenna, or Tracy this guy out of the apartment.
 I'm out of ideas.
 Hm.
 I got the apartment! You did? How? He moved out.
 And now, it's mine.
 You didn't really answer my question.
 What? What did you do? You didn't.
 Manhattan real estate No rules, right? You think I'm disgusting? I used the Sun Tea System to stop global warming.
 You used it to kick a gay cop out of his apartment.
 I have no regrets! No regrets! Hey, Tracy.
 Now you can tell me your filthy strip club story.
 Frank, I'm going to have a daughter.
 And I would never tell that story.
 It's demeaning to women.
 Especially if they've had their boobies sneezed on by a tiger.
 Good for you, sir.
 Did you know that fluorescent light bulbs last 10 times longer than regular ones? Yep, and they only use one-quarter of the power.
 But if we're going to solve the climate crisis we've got to change more than the light bulbs and the windows.
 We've got to change the laws and the policies.
 Through collective political action on a large scale.
 You know, there's an old African proverb that I made up.
 "If you want to go quickly, go alone.
 If you want to go far, go together.
" We need to go far, quickly.
 Uh, Mr.
 Vice President? The snack table isn't going to clean itself.
 Look again, Kenneth.
 Well, that's not super helpful.
 Kenneth, encourage your lawmakers to take action.
 And recycle everything.
 Including jokes.
 I'm sorry, sir, what? Quiet.
 A whale is in trouble.
 I have to go.
 Sir, I am happy to report that T.
G.
 S.
 Reduced its carbon footprint by seven percent.
 Kenneth, I also want to do my part.
 You do? I may not have children anytime soon but when I do, I want the Earth here.
 That's why I've replaced my wasteful imported flowers with beautiful azaleas from our very own 30 Rock terrace.
 Oh, my.
 They're still sprinkled with morning dew, Kenneth.
 Smell them.
 Smell my flowers, Kenneth.

 Halftime Show, storage for broken copier equipment.
 And now Dealbreakers.
 Liz Lemon's got her very own talk show.
 # I'm a star # # I'm on top # # Somebody bring me some ham # I used to sing that when I was a kid.
 Yes, well, it's really happening for you, Lemon.
 Between T.
G.
 S.
 And this, you're like a swarthy, big-hipped Kelly Ripa.
 I know.
 I mean, if this works, my life will be totally different.
 I have to go back into space, Liz.
 I hope you enjoyed the kissing, followed by my genuine interest in that T.
V.
 Dance competition.
 Bye, Astronaut Mike Dexter.
 Liz, snap out of it.
 Jenna's locked herself in her dressing room.
 What? No, go away.
 This is my fantasy, Pete.
 I knew it.
 You're blonde in your fantasies.
 It looks terrible.
 Jenna, what's wrong? My niece drew a picture of me, and I look so fat! Well, I really like your hair today.
 Thank you.
 But you don't know what it looks like.
 Because of the door! Wow, she finally figured that out.
 Okay, Jenna, you win.
 If you're really not feeling up to doing the show this week, I know that Jenny McCarthy is in town.
 My nemesis? Never.
 Oh, my God, I bet she put Charlotte up to this.
 Lemon, that is why Dealbreakers is going to work.
 Because your star is a crazy person.
 And my star is you.
 And I am not crazy.
 Because, unlike Jenna, my mother never used my beauty pageant winnings to buy her married boyfriend a motorcycle.
 Exactly.
 Boy, if this thing works, it could be my ticket out.
 This job is starting to get to me.
 Lately, I've been shoplifting just to feel in control.
 Because no one knows I took the candy bar.
 No one but Peter.
 Uh, Liz Lemon, I need to talk to you.
 What's up, Tray? Come over here and check out my corner.
 No trap.
 What? Come over here, I said.
 In my normal tone of voice.
 Liz Lemon, recently, I realized that I have a hole in my heart.
 And not the one I got from eating batteries.
 It's 'cause I don't have a daughter.
 Oh, that's actually sweet.
 I want a baby girl, Liz Lemon.
 I mean, having a daughter is like going to the N.
B.
A.
 All-Star Weekend.
 It changes you.
 It makes you want to take your wife to the doctor.
 Well, I think that's great, Tray.
 I'm glad you feel that way.
 Because Angie's on her way up, and I want you to tell her for me.
 Oh, no, I'm not doing that.
 Oh, yes, you are.
 Click.
 I said "click" to distract you from the sound of the handcuffs.
 What? Uh-uh! Why are you handcuffed to the bookshelf I built for my husband? Tracy did this to make me tell you that he wants to have a baby girl.
 You did good.
 Really? Have you lost your mind? I'm not going to raise another child by myself.
 What are you implying? I'm a very attentive father.
 Oh, please, Tracy.
 Where were you last week during Tracy Jr.
's birthday party? There was a better kid's birthday party up the street.
 I cannot believe you made me come here for this.
 Now I won't have enough time to shop for Christmas presents and still get my hair did.
 Your hair did? You just got your hair did.
 You have to get your hair did again? It needs to be did every week! Maybe we could "undid" these handcuffs.
 Oh, cracker.
 Racist.
 You know what? Keep your hair appointment.
 I'll do the Christmas shopping this year to prove to you I can be reliable and that I can finish everything that I No, come back.
 Aw Listen up, dummies.
 I'm going to be gone this week doing my talk show.
 So I need to leave someone responsible in charge.
 Now it's not about who I like the most or who's the funniest.
 So it's Toofer.
 Hm, thank you.
 As Tennyson wrote, "I mete and dole" No, nevermind.
 Lutz, you want it? Mm-hm.
 Oh, okay.
 Too much pressure.
 Writers who never talk? Anybody want a promotion? Great, Frank, congratulations.
 You are the new boss.
 Awesome.
 A cool person in charge for once.
 My first act as leader? I'm telling them to take down the internet firewall.
 We can surf porn again.
 Wonderful, porn.
 I like porn.
 Sir, a Mr.
 Adouche is on the phone? I.
M.
 Adouche? I.
M.
 Adouche? Banks! What do you want? Did you say it? No, I knew right away.
 Oh, sure you did.
 Well, D.
C.
's great.
 So many men in uniform down here.
 If you're calling to check in on your bailout money, just read the budgets we sent.
 We're getting more efficient every day.
 Our health care costs are way down since we started putting something in the coffee to keep women from getting pregnant.
 It's funny, I have been reading the budgets.
 And I couldn't help but notice that you're doing a talk show with your four-eyed, little friend.
 That is a business decision.
 She wrote a very popular book.
 It doesn't matter.
 Do you know how bad that could look? Worse than me in Capri pants.
 Which you'd think I'd be able to pull off 'cause I'm tall.
 What are you saying, Banks? If this Liz Lemon project loses one penny, I am going to publicly flog you like well, like me at the Provincetown Flogging Festival.
 In other words, it had better work.
 But don't worry.
 She's just a writer with zero performing experience.
 It'll work.
 I'll make it work.
 Moron says, "what"? What? What does he say? What? I need a special gift for my wife.
 Something that says I'm responsible.
 Something simple, classy.
 I get it, elegance.
 That's why people come to Yakov's Nubian Bling Explosion.
 Yes, perfect.
 What's that? I want it.
 I forgot why I originally came in here.
 Oh, that belonged to Philip Michael Thomas, the actor who played Tubbs on Miami Vice.
 Sure, I know him from the secret black people meetings.
 Nah, I'm just kidding.
 He's not invited.
 But who's "EGOT"? EGOT is not a person, T.
J.
, it's a goal.
 It stands for Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.
 Four awards that Thomas planned on winning in his career.
 That's a good goal for a talented crazy person.
 Anyway, you wanted something special for your wife.
 Nah, that was earlier.
 I want this.
 So how are you feeling? Feeling good? Ready to go? With Dealbreakers, yeah.
 The set looks great, I'm ready.
 We just need an audience.
 I just want to make sure we're not forgetting anything.
 Because this has to work.
 Has to work? It's going to work, right? Yes, because it has to.
 And because we've thought of everything.
 What if you didn't wear your glasses? What? Do you think it's not a good look? Well, I don't know, are you married? I'm just saying.
 Well, I can lose the glasses.
 I just might not be able to read the teleprompter.
 And I can't wear contacts, because the doctor says my eyeballs are too pointy.
 What about LASIK? The show will pay for it.
 Okay, If you think it's a good idea.
 Great, now we're perfect.
 What if we changed your name to Veronica St.
 Pierre? No, that's too much.
 Your hair is fine.
 Marco! Polo.
 Marco! Tracy, put that sword down and help me take these gifts to the car.
 No need.
 I got something better than presents for you and the kids.
 I got us all this "EGOT" necklace for me.
 That's exactly what I was talking about.
 I send you out for gifts, and you go and buy that dumb necklace for yourself.
 It's not dumb, It's smart.
 This necklace is a life goal.
 I'm going to win me an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony.
 What? Tracy, you've never finished a damn thing in your life.
 I am going to EGOT.
 For us.
 For the family.
 And especially for little Chewbaquina Jordan.
 Okay, Tray.
 You go out and win every one of those awards and prove how responsible you are and I'll give you a daughter.
 But until then, I don't want to hear another word about your baby girl.
 Great, I'll be in touch.
 You still using your Hotmail account? Mmm.
 One more "peow" and donezies.
 Did it work? I'm sure it did.
 This machine is a genuine LASIG? Hm, curious.
 Here.
 Can you read the top line over there? "Dear Dr.
 Spitcheman, thank you for your submission.
 The 'New England Journal of Medicine' does not publish x-rated cartoons.
" Well, why not? So frustrating.
 But at least I heard it from a friend.
 So while we're here, what else do you want to do? Face burn? Bone morph? Mouth peel? No, thank you, I can't.
 I'm going to be on T.
V.
 This week.
 Really? I think you mean radio.
 No, I don't.
 What is what? Why do people keep saying stuff like that? You seem nervous.
 I could give you something for that.
 Ah, but you know what? I'm not supposed to have sex with my patients.
 Your hair is fine.
 Hey, we're all going to Chuck E.
 Cheese's.
 It's divorced, Hispanic mom night.
 I can't.
 I've got to proof all these sketches, figure out the rundown, then meet with props in 10 minutes! Okay, have a good night, Liz.
 Very funny.
 I'm not Liz.
 Ooh, ham.
 Mmm.
 I'd first like to thank my creative team for coming in on such short notice.
 And I'm sorry I'm four hours late.
 Dotcom, research update.
 I Googled the complete list of all past EGOT winners.
 Listen to this.
 Composer Richard Rodgers.
 Composer Jonathan Tunick.
 Composer Marvin Hamlisch.
 That's good raw data.
 Now turn it over to Grizz for analysis.
 They're all composers.
 Kenneth, synthesize Grizz's analysis.
 Mr.
 Jordan, you need to write one great song.
 A song whose success will get it featured on a T.
V.
 Show.
 And then a movie based on that T.
V.
 Show.
 Then a Broadway play based on that movie.
 This is how I'm going to get my baby girl.
 All I have to do is create the most popular song of all time.
 # I've started already # That's great, Tray.
 It's all happening! Hi.
 You got a haircut.
 Oh, actually, I got three haircuts.
 The first two made me look nuts.
 Hey, do I say the word "camera" weird? "Cam-er-rah".
 "Cam-er-rah".
 "Cam-er-rah".
 I need to talk to you.
 I have an actress problem.
 Okay, don't try to move the body yourself.
 No, It's Liz.
 I need Dealbreakers to work.
 And yesterday, I told her that she shouldn't wear her glasses.
 Oh, no, why did you do that? Jack, you don't know what it's like to be on "ca-mer-rah".
 You're vulnerable.
 You're exposed.
 It doesn't take a lot to send you over the edge.
 This is Lemon.
 Not anymore.
 You've created two Lizzes.
 Regular Liz and Performer Liz.
 You've got to lie to her.
 Coddle her.
 Protect her from the real world.
 I get it.
 Treat her like The New York Times treats its readers.
 Guys, Standards is saying no the Rubik's Pube thing.
 What? You look exactly like Liz.
 What? Shut up.
 You've just never seen my reading glasses before, which I have to wear to read your dumb sketches.
 And I lost my hat after I threw it at a bus that wouldn't stop for me even though the guy could see me running.
 What about the purse and sweater? This is a bag for all the scripts I now have to carry.
 And I'm wearing a sweater because the studio's cold.
 You know what? I don't have to explain myself.
 You dummies have no idea what it's like to be in charge.
 Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be in my office, trying to have it all.
 What is happening to me? Dealbreakers main titles.
 Take number 510.
 Okay, here we go.
 One more, this is the one.
 And action! Great and smile.
 With your mouth.
 And raise the roof! Yeah, you can "Whoo!" You can do it.
 Good! Oh, my God.
 Break it down, break it down.
 Oh, yeah, yeah, sassy.
 Sass it up.
 Wave to a friend.
 Wave like a human being.
 You remember waving? And blow a kiss.
 No, with your hands! And, uh a little cleavage.
 Nope.
 And just have fun.
 Are you spinning a basketball? This is great.
 You look really relaxed.
 I'd watch this show.
 Okay.
 What's happening to her? Okay, Lemon, step in front of the hi-def camera.
 Let's see what that looks like.
 No, no hi-def.
 Uh because of the camera.
 The, uh, "gobos" are really "moraying".
 Right, Pete? Please step away! I have a delivery for Miss Lemon.
 Oh, an opening-night bouquet.
 I wonder who sent that? They're from Devin Banks.
 Oh Banks.
 "FEMA paid for these flowers because your show is going to be a disaster.
" Jack, what is this? Oh, God.
 I got a tattoo that says "Freedom" in Chinese.
 And for what? May I have a moment alone with Lemon, please? Okay, here is the honest truth.
 You're better at this than Oprah.
 I need a minute.
 Hello? I fully understand the irony of what I'm about to say.
 But I have locked myself in my dressing room, and I am not coming out.
 # People # # Love song # # About love and cars # # I've started already # Stop, stop! It's all wrong! How could five of the most popular musical styles, all played at once, sound so bad? Mr.
 Jordan, I'm not sure you've thought this through.
 Oh, yeah, Ken? What do you know about the pressures of EGOTing? I need to speak to someone who's been there.
 A fellow EGOTer.
 Tracy, what are you doing? You're supposed to be in a fitting.
 Nerds! Is it me, or is Liz Lemon getting hotter? Lemon, it's Jack.
 Don't even bother! I've been on the other side of that door, Jack.
 You can't outsmart me.
 I know all the tricks.
 It's like that movie, The Negotiator.
 I didn't see that.
 In the end, the police chief turns out to be the bad guy.
 I didn't say I wasn't going to see it.
 Lemon, what is it going to take to get you out of there? What do you want? I don't want to do this show anymore.
 Shut it down.
 I can't do that.
 If this thing loses money, I may as well let Banks play out one of his gay, home invasion fantasies on me.
 Then I guess it's a standoff.
 And I want pizzas for all the hungry people in here! So you're trying to EGOT, huh? I've got to EGOT, Whoopi.
 See I made this deal with my wife.
 If I don't EGOT, then I can't have another kid.
 You know, I got my EGOT on a bet too.
 That's why Arlen Specter had to change parties.
 You created the Super Majority? Mmm.
 I don't get it.
 Why is it so hard? I paid all these people to create the most popular song in the world for me.
 That's the problem right there.
 You cannot fake your way to an EGOT, fool.
 You know, all these awards I got, I got for projects I believed in.
 Wait, is that a Daytime Emmy? It still counts.
 Girl's got to eat.
 Listen, my point really is it's got to come from the heart.
 And then the awards will follow.
 That's good advice, Whoopi.
 Mm-hm.
 Say, can I have a glass of water before I leave? Yeah, sure.
 Thank you.
 Colored man.
 Put 'em back.
 Put it down.
 Lemon, come out.
 Jack, I just got your business "sext".
 What have you done? This is no time to play the blame game.
 Of course not.
 I'm not wearing my outfit.
 Jenna, you're the only one who knows what Lemon is going through right now.
 Help me.
 Well, I hate to even tell you this, but I've always wondered why you guys don't take the door off its hinges.
 Nah, that's not going to work.
 This changes nothing.
 Lemon, I am hemorrhaging money right now.
 Your audience has spent the last hour listening to Kenneth tell cleaned up versions of Garrison Keillor stories.
 Now I understand Performer Liz is freaking out.
 So I need Regular Liz's help.
 I don't know that she's here right now.
 Lemon, I need Regular Liz to tell that crazy bitch, Performer Liz, to get out on stage and give me something I can try to make money off of.
 Please.
 Hey, buddy.
 Your hair looks nice.
 Don't try those tricks on me! Oh, boy.
 Okay, I know that it's been a hard day.
 I could have had it all.
 But you had to ruin it! With your thinking! Come on.
 # You're a star # # You're on top # # Somebody bring you some ham # You should kill yourself.
 Good God, Lemon, what is that? This is how I cry now.
 Ever since you made me get that off-brand eye surgery.
 Lemon, what have we done to you? It's okay.
 Go home and get some rest.
 I'll take the hit.
 I can't let you do that for me.
 Let him go.
 # Baby girl, you're the missing piece # # The perfect fit, baby girl # # You're the product of doing it # Damn it, Tracy.
 That's what's in your heart? You sweet fool.
 Let's make a baby.
 Wait.
 If you really want a baby, I'll give you my gift.
 But I must warn you.
 I won't be around a lot.
 'Cause I'm EGOTing.
 Aw, Tracy Jordan, you're an idiot.
 I know.
 We're lucky people laugh when I say stuff.
 So, uh, how are we doing? And by "we", I just mean the two of us.
 I'm okay.
 You shouldn't have said anything about my hair.
 I know that now.
 I think it will grow out nicely.
 I agree.
 Look, I'm sorry that I ruined Uh, you didn't.
 I sold the opening titles.
 Really? To who? "Whom".
 And from now on, whenever a television is on in the background of a Sheinhardt-Universal soap opera, you will be on it.
 I'm going to be on T.
V.
 On T.
V.
 You're back.
 Thank God.
 I missed you so much.
 Don't ever leave me again.
 Mmm I'm back.
 I'm back.
 Muah! Hey, you, Fancy Face.
 You scared me.
 I thought I was going to lose you.
 You can't get rid of me that easily.
 That's me.
 My wedding ring.
 I found it on the beach.
 That's me again.
 What is that? What is this T.
V.
 Show? It's very distracting.
   

                




                    			Your hair is looking less weird.
 Thanks.
 Okay, Christmas gifts.
 Uh, Pete? Well, he keeps telling me that he wants skinny jeans.
 So Cheese of the Month Club.
 Uh, Jenna? Oh, I want to take that Internet photo of her nipple slip and have it made into a jigsaw puzzle.
 Aw, she'll love that.
 Okay.
 Uh, Jack? Jack Donaghy? Yeah.
 Huh, well, I've never exchanged gifts with Jack before.
 But we've known each other four years.
 I mean, we're friends, right? Absolutely.
 You guys remind me of that bantering couple in that old movie.
 Um Meet the Parents.
 Oh, my, is it yearbook time already? The company has acquired an up-and-coming social networking site called YouFace.
 So each executive has to set up their YouFace page.
 Now this picture will be my "PhoLo".
 Not a word.
 Which is a contraction for "photo" and "hello".
 YouFace.
 Who are you facing? No one.
 Those sites are for horny, married chicks with kids who want to exchange pervy emails with their old high school boyfriends.
 And since all your high school boyfriends are now gay Exactly.
 So, Lemon, what can I do for you? Do you want to exchange Christmas presents this year? Uh, just, uh I would love to.
 Great, so what do you want? Excuse me? Well, in my family, everybody just writes down what they want and then, we give it to each other.
 And everybody has a great Christmas.
 Lemon, gift giving is the purest expression of friendship.
 I'm going to think about what I know and like about you, and that will lead me to the perfect gift.
 And you do the same.
 So bath salts in a coffee mug would be not it.
 Thanks.
 Hey, new guy, how's it going? Well, I'm worried.
 I haven't been on the show the last two weeks.
 Good stuff, listen.
 Every Christmas, I collect money from the staff and give it to the cleaning ladies.
 Yeah, of course.
 Count me in.
 Jenna, would you care to chip in? No, thank you.
 I'm doing my own thing this year.
 She does this every year.
 She doesn't give the money because she knows that the card says "From the cast and writers of T.
G.
S.
" And she'll get credit for it anyway.
 I should make up new cards that say "Happy Holidays from Everyone Except Jenna".
 But that would require me to have some remaining life force, Danny.
 So I'm going to go have a drink alone at the Oyster Bar.
 I've been finger tagged, Lemon.
 Was it down by the subway entrance? 'Cause I saw a gangly looking kid down there.
 "Finger tagged" means I have been contacted by someone else on YouFace.
 In this case, that would be Nancy Donovan, the cutest girl at East Sadchester High School, class of 1976.
 That's the year my mom was born.
 Would you get us some pens? See, I told you you'd find an old girlfriend.
 She wasn't my girlfriend, Lemon.
 But I must admit Nancy Donovan was my first crush.
 My first crush was Larry Wilcox.
 The blonde guy from CHiPs? Bowl haircut? Thin lips? This wasn't a T.
V.
 Crush.
 This was real.
 Oh, mine got pretty real.
 Here is a woman I haven't seen in 25 years.
 One day on YouFace, and she finds me, tells me that she's coming down to pick up her sons at Fordham, and she'd love to swing by.
 What does that mean? Did she post you Public or P.
M.
 You? I don't know.
 Let's look at her page.
 Okay.
 W-W-W Got it.
 I'll check her Face-Vault to see her previous "Bing-Bings.
" Is YouFace hyphenated? Huh, six months ago, her status said she was married.
 But 14 days ago, she changed it to "Working On It".
 Really, may I see that? Nope, do not put a hyphen in YouFace.
 There are definitely faces here, but they are not being treated with respect.
 Ew.
 Kenneth.
 Bag of names.
 "Seeka Sanna".
 "Seeka Sanna".
 Kenneth is doing his Secret Santa Fun Swap thing.
 Ugh, He takes the two worst parts of Christmas, giving and rules, and combines them.
 And then, the person with the highest number gives the smallest gift to the tallest person.
 If they want to switch, they cannot.
 Unless they do.
 Then everyone puts their head down, except the murderer.
 Oh, wait, that's not right.
 The whole thing was so confusing, I ended up getting my own crappy gift back.
 Like I need two copies of "Over 60 Vixens".
 Mr.
 Rossitano, would you like to participate in our studio-wide Secret Santa Fun Swap? I totally would do Secret Santa, but I don't believe in Christmas because I'm a Verdukian.
 Yes, we are all very strict Verdukians.
 Oh, my apologies.
 I've never heard of that religion.
 What do y'all believe in? Oh, many things.
 Uh, the healing power of root beer.
 That a man can have up to nine wives if two of them are male.
 And we always leave work to go to the movies on Merlinpeen.
 So good Merlinpeen to you, Kenneth.
 Good Merlinpeen.
 Good Merlinpeen.
 Talk to me, what's this? Is this a store Jack likes? Unbelievable.
 Do you really think you belong on Mr.
 Donaghy's personal gift list? Why not? We're friends.
 He's the best gift giver in the world.
 I tried once.
 I bought him a $ 95 bottle of olive oil.
 In return, he got my sister out of a North Korean jail.
 Oh, brother.
 You will never match him.
 And I'll be here next year to take you off of that list.
 Even if I get into law school, I won't go.
 All right.
 Jonathan, would you Oh, Lemon.
 Come in here for a minute.
 I want you to meet my old friend, Nancy Donovan.
 That's my maiden name.
 I keep telling you.
 Things have changed.
 You know, your hair It's like a shag carpet.
 I want to sit on it and play a board game.
 Nice to meet you.
 Nice to meet you.
 Is your family here? Uh, just the boys.
 My husband couldn't make it.
 Husband couldn't make it.
 Oh, I brought something to show you.
 It's, uh It's goofy.
 I know.
 Oh, my goodness.
 "Hey, Beantown".
 "Hey, Beantown" was the school musical Nancy and I were in.
 I thought you had stage fright.
 # Hey, Beantown # # The Puritans found you # # Hey, Beantown # # Water surrounds you # # So let's watch the Sox play ball # # Play ball! # # Hey, Beantown, you've got it all # Whoo! Yeah, I did plays in high school too.
 I was John Proctor in "The Crucible".
 Oh, you went to an all girls' school? No.
 Jack played Paul Revere.
 And we were all jealous of Lisa Alberson 'cause she got to play his horse.
 Bless her heart.
 She had a hypoactive thyroid.
 Do you remember the time she cannonballed into Mel and Deschette's above-ground pool and tore the lining? And floated out into the street! And got hit by that car? I have never heard you laugh like that before! That's how he laughs when he's really crackin' up.
 What, have you been faking it with me for the last three years? What are you, Hugh Hefner's twin girlfriends? Nice to meet you.
 Nice to meet you.
 She still owes me $10.
 That's true.
 Yeah, he was always a thief, that guy He was a moocher.
 What's with all the junk, Ken? Well, these are my all-inclusive holiday decorations.
 Here's a little Christmas tree.
 Okay.
 A menorah.
 A picture of President Obama for the Muslims.
 Going to let that one slide.
 And a bowl of meat cubes with picture of Jimmy Connors sticking out, in the tradition of Verdukianism.
 Verdukianism? That doesn't make sense.
 Jimmy is Catholic.
 Ah, Good Merlinpeen, gentlemen.
 Good Merlinpeen.
 So you guys are Verdukians? Yep, that's why we can't do Secret Santa.
 Mm-hm.
 Then sing that Verdukian winter carol.
 The famous one.
 # Oh # # Meatball of Verduk # # You bring me such # # Pizza # Now a Christmas song.
 Oh, Mr.
 Baker! Hm? # Oh, holy night # # The stars are brightly shining # What the what? New dude is as good at singing as Tracy Jordan is at everything.
 Danny, was that you? Why didn't you tell me you could sing like that? I didn't think it was important.
 Not important? I had Tracy playing Josh Groban last week.
 Come here.
 Listen up.
 Jenna's not singing the Christmas solo on Friday's show.
 You are.
 What? Why? For the most wonderful reason of all.
 Christmas vengeance.
 Jenna will finally be punished for all the times I had to pay her share of the money for the cleaning ladies.
 No, I don't want to steal Jenna's solo.
 That's not what the holidays are about.
 Maybe Jenna and I could do a duet instead? Yes, a duet.
 Share the stage.
 She will love that.
 I'm sorry.
 Are you being sarcastic? Canadians have a hard time recognizing it because we don't have a big Jewish population.
 I'm not being sarcastic at all.
 Okay, great.
 Merry Christmas, Pete Hornberger.
 I can't believe you're not married.
 I thought you'd have some hot-shot, young wife with black hair who says queer stuff like "dressing on the side".
 Well, I was married.
 But people grow apart.
 Was she a bitch, or did you cheat? The former.
 The former? What are you, a newscaster? Whatever happened to your Boston accent? You're a liar, Nancy Donovan.
 I never had a Boston accent.
 What about you, loudmouth? What Southie piece of trash did you trick into marrying you? I'll have you know that my husband happens to be a very prominent Pakistani anesthesiologist.
 No, I'm kidding you, he's an Irish moron.
 Runs a roofing company.
 So if you need your roof done, call someone else.
 Because my guy's not reliable.
 Oh.
 What do you say I take you and the boys out to dinner? I know a lot of terrific places.
 Uh, I don't know.
 They have their hearts set on the ESPN Zone.
 They've been talking about the "Hideki Matsui Caliente Fajitas" all week.
 Well, let them go to the ESPN Zone, and I'll take you someplace nice.
 Yeah, sure.
 Why not? Um I'm glad we, uh, never made out in high school.
 Otherwise, this whole thing would be so awkward.
 Excuse me.
 We kissed every night on stage in "Hey, Beantown".
 No, that doesn't count.
 There wasn't even any tongue.
 But only because my mother told me that French kissing was for the Italians.
 They do love it.
 How else do you think I got Mr.
 Sorrentino to cast me as the Spirit of Liberty? A duet? Really? I didn't know you sang.
 It's funny, because it's kind of my thing.
 Next thing I know, you're going to be telling me you're really blonde and have a urinary tract infection.
 Maybe I should hear you sing.
 That way, I can plan our harmonies.
 # Oh, Danny boy # # The pipes, the pipes are calling # # From glen to glen, and down the mountainside # I'm sorry, is your nose bleeding? Yes, because I'm so happy for you.
 It's definitely not a rage stroke.
 Oh, great.
 What's up, Special K? Having a party? Not me, sir.
 Tonight is the Verdukian Holiday of Mouth Pleasures.
 Misters Rossitano, Spurlock and Lutz must have free sausage pizza followed by some gentle flossing performed by a blond virgin.
 Your generosity is being taken advantage of.
 What do you mean? Verdukianism.
 It's fake.
 Those dudes made it up because they didn't want to do Secret Santa.
 But they had all these rules and rituals.
 That's what religion is, K-Fed.
 Just a bunch of made-up rules to manipulate people.
 Why don't Catholics eat meat on Fridays? I'll tell you why.
 Because the Pope owns Long John Silvers.
 Wait a minute.
 Are you saying that other religions are made up by man too? Uh-oh, Ken.
 We may have fallen into the intellectual deep end here.
 And if you try to grab onto me, we'll both drown.
 What if there is no God? Okay, time to go.
 So far, she's just uploaded some pictures.
 "My Christmas Trip to New York with the boys".
 Ice skating, sure.
 Nancy cupping Burt Reynolds' crotch at the wax museum.
 That finger touching his moustache is me.
 Why did she crop me out of all these pictures? No, it's good.
 If Nancy didn't care about you, she'd leave you in.
 But she must feel weird about her husband seeing you there.
 She feels weird in a good way.
 Weird in a good way, huh.
 Like going to the gym drunk.
 She changed her status from "Working On It" to "Weirdsies".
 O.
M.
F.
G.
 Is that maroon and navy? Nerds! Don't tell me, Lemon.
 You spent $500 on a tie I already have.
 At a store with a "no returns" policy.
 Oh, shark farts.
 But this is my lucky tie.
 And anyone who knows me well would know that.
 Just like I know you only wear that sweater when you're planning on eating pasta with red sauce.
 Nice haircut.
 Let's level the playing field.
 How about the most we can spend on each other's gifts is zero dollars? Really? You want to exchange creative gifts? Oh, well.
 You are the one that's in trouble now, buddy.
 Because creativity, to me, is just like like a bird.
 Like a friendly bird that embraces all ideas.
 Just, like, shoots out of its eyes all kinds of beauty.
 Wow, Lemon.
 This is like watching Hemingway write.
 Mark Hemingway.
 Yeah, wait.
 Why are you wearing your lucky tie? I'm having dinner tonight with Nancy.
 Alone.
 She changed her status to "Weirdsies".
 What are your expectations here? She's married.
 Uh, I don't know, Lemon.
 Nancy's leaving tomorrow.
 Can't I just enjoy this while it lasts? That's what I said when that hot dog vendor passed out.
 But you made me go get help.
 Hey.
 Did you hire this guy to hide in my dressing room and punch me in the throat? No.
 He's bigger than you said.
 May I still collect my kiss? Vattene! Why would you do that, Jenna? I thought we were buddies.
 You don't fool me with your innocent act.
 First, you force your way into my solo.
 I didn't force anything.
 Pete is the one that wanted to take away your solo.
 What? Why? He's mad that you don't chip in for the cleaning ladies' Christmas gifts.
 Well, I'm doing my own thing.
 I got them this.
 The program from this year's Asian Women in Television Awards.
 Julie Chen's energy drink, Chenergize.
 A FlipVideo.
 Hang on, I didn't know this was in there.
 Wow, you're really getting the Christmas spirit.
 Oh, my God.
 I just got sarcasm.
 Fine, I'm terrible at Christmas because I've never had a nice one.
 Sometimes, my mom would take us to see Santa Claus, but that's just because she suspected one of them was my deadbeat dad.
 So I'd have to get on every Santa's lap in the Bakersfield area and scream, "You ought be ashamed of yourself, Travis!" Oh, no.
 That sounds horrible.
 And then, I'd sing carols in the middle of Sears just to create a distraction while my mom shoplifted.
 And those few minutes when I was singing carols, That was the one part of Christmas I liked.
 And now, you've taken that away from me.
 Well, that went well.
 Yes.
 You're just a Kenny Rogers doll now.
 Something you want to say? We want to do Secret Santa! Yay! Secret Santa has been cancelled.
 Because I have lost my faith.
 But something's changed in us.
 It's a Christmas miracle.
 That certainly proves God exists.
 If God existed, then he would punish you for what you did to me.
 And yet, here you are, unpunished.
 Ergo, our actions have no consequences.
 So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go buy some guitar music.
 You have turned Ken out, on Christmas! You will fix this.
 How? Punish yourselves! Hey, what was the name of that abandoned factory where we used to go shoot B.
B.
 Guns at rats? Wolford Cap and Gown.
 Of course.
 Is that still there? No, they tore it down and put up a big playground.
 Oh, what a shame.
 Yeah.
 So, uh, can I buy you a nightcap? Better not.
 We've got an early train back to Boston tomorrow.
 And you know how hard it is to get teenagers out of bed in the morning.
 Oh, yes.
 But not in the way you're talking about.
 It was great to see you, Jack.
 I'll, uh I'll hit you on YouFace.
 But you've got to promise to finger tag me back.
 I'd like nothing more.
 Help, Lutz thought that red wire was a Twizzler! Kenneth, he's being punished by a stern but just God.
 You can't fake this, Mr.
 Lutz.
 Or hurt yourself on purpose by, say, grabbing that blue wire, which would've immediately killed you.
 It needs to be God's will.
 I almost touched that blue wire.
 I could have died.
 I'm gonna tell Sharon I love her.
 I don't care if we're cousins! What is this? This is your zero dollars present.
 # Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, my friend is Jack # # If you like his necktie, pat him on the back # # He's a Jack-attack, paddy whack, give the man a snack # Nope, never mind.
 Not your present.
 Uh, no, please.
 Don't go.
 I'm sorry that I wasn't even able to feign interest in whatever that was.
 Nancy left this morning.
 She'll be on the 12:10 out of Penn Station.
 Do you ever wonder, Lemon, what your life would be like if you had never left your hometown? Oh, of course.
 Have you not read my terrible short story, "The Two Paths of Virginia Apple"? I've spent my whole life trying to erase where I came from.
 But after these moments with Nancy, for the first time in my life I'm homesick.
 Well, you'll stay in touch, right? I don't know.
 Nancy's going back to her husband.
 Her life.
 I think this was just a moment in time.
 I just wish it had lasted a little bit longer.
 Okay, well, I'm going to go work on your real gift.
 You know what would go real nice on that wall over there? A drawing of a frog.
 No.
 No.
 Back in five four, three, two # Frosted windowpanes # # Candles gleaming inside # # Painted candy canes on the tree # # Santa's on his way # # He's filled his sleigh with things # # Things for you and me # # It's that time of year # # When the world falls in love # # Every song you hear seems to say # # Merry Christmas # # May your New Years dreams come true # Hey, Jack.
 My train got cancelled.
 We spent all day at Penn Station trying to get out.
 I figured I should finally take the hint and meet you for that drink.
 Well, I'm glad you came back.
 And I figured I owed you a kiss goodbye.
 I mean, uh, what's the big deal? We did it every night in "Hey, Beantown".
 We'll just do it high school style.
 No tongue.
 # And this song of mine # # In three quarter time # # Wishes you and yours # # The same thing too # Merry Christmas, Lemon.
 The gender-blind Crucible! Framed in wood from the stage of your high school theater.
 Jonathan had to drive all over Pennsylvania, and I did not reimburse him for gas.
 Zero dollars.
 Thank you, Jack, that's amazing.
 And don't worry about my present.
 I already got the greatest Christmas gift you could imagine.
 Nancy came back to say goodbye.
 Her train was cancelled.
 Because somebody called in a bomb threat to Penn Station? You're welcome.
 Merry Christmas.
 Hi, which of you are Frank Rossitano and James Spurlock? That's us.
 You're under arrest.
 What did we do? Someone called in a bomb threat from your phone this morning.
 I renounce Verdukianism! What, what does that mean? Are you Al Qaeda? Come here, pal.
 My angry God is punishing them.
 It's a Christmas miracle.
 # And this song of mine # # In three quarter time # # Wishes you and yours # # The same thing too # # Merry Christmas to you # Are you Larry Wilcox? Yes, ma'am, this evening, you have permission to call me Officer Jon Baker.
 Oh, but, uh, no sex stuff and no touching my gun.
 Of course, yeah.
 Merry Christmas, Lemon.
 Okay.
 Wait, how is this zero dollars? Well, he promised to get me on Dancing With the Stars.
 But that's on A.
B.
C.
 Donaghy!   

                




                    			Hey, Jack! Did you dye your hair? No, no.
 So how was your New Year's? Wonderful.
 My dear friend, the deep-sea explorer, Bob Ballard, brought over a from a sunken Phoenician trading vessel.
 The wine turned out to be quite toxic.
 My guests and I spent the stroke of midnight in my garden vomiting.
 Oh, my God, sorry.
 Don't be.
 The whole night, purging.
 The New Year, the vivid hallucinations of Astarte, the Phoenician Goddess of Sex and War, it all wiped the slate clean.
 So Nancy Donovan What happened before Christmas was a mistake.
 And she hasn't contacted me since, so clearly, she agrees.
 It's over.
 That's healthy, a clean break.
 Exactly.
 A clean break.
 Uh, so, what about you, Lemon? Is your 2010 off to a good start? Well, I spent New Year's Eve with my family, which was actually very special.
 My cousin, Randy, this kid from this rural coal-mining town, came out to us.
 And I think old Liz Lemon had a little something to do with that.
 Randy's gay, everybody.
 He's gay.
 I think everyone knew.
 Hey, Tracy.
 Finally.
 Over the break, I forgot what floor I worked on.
 Six, Tracy.
 Six, I knew it was a character from Blossom, but I couldn't find the "Joey Russo" button.
 Hold the door! You guys, I had the most amazing New Year's.
 I met James Franco's manager.
 It was like a fairy tale.
 My client, James Franco, he's actively looking for a relationship with a human woman to dispel certain unsavory rumors.
 Are you available for a fake romance with a movie star? Does chewing on a sponge trick your brain's hunger center? Yes, yes! A million times, yes! So this is some arranged Hollywood relationship? With James Franco.
 Can you believe they went to me before Cancun? I think it's great.
 The exposure will do wonders for you and T.
G.
 S.
 Lemon, I want you and Jenna to have a meeting with James Franco and make sure his manager doesn't screw her.
 Too late.
 Oh, wait, which way did you mean that? I had a pretty amazing New Year's too.
 My wife and I are trying for a daughter.
 And on New Year's Eve, I think I got Angie pregnant.
 No, no, no.
 Okay, but I was going to describe it real good.
 How was your New Year's, sir? Perfect.
 Oh, my God.
 As you know, on New Year's, I finally met my birth parents.
 So thank you for asking about that.
 I called her, Lemon.
 What? I called Nancy on New Year's Eve at 3:42 A.
M.
 Damn it, Phoenician wine.
 And you don't remember doing it? The last thing I remember is going into a closet and switching clothes with Bob Ballard.
 Look, I don't think you actually spoke to her.
 You hit "pound" after the number.
 I think you left a message.
 Cerie, get on her YouFace page.
 Lemon, do you mind? One second.
 Okay.
 Okay, her YouFace page says they're on vacation.
 They're borrowing a friend's condo in Florida.
 Oh, what have I done? The woman is on vacation with her husband as we speak.
 Probably having beach sex.
 Which is the third best sex after elevator and White House.
 Is there any chance that she hasn't heard it yet? As a frequent leaver of drunken messages, I can tell you no good can come of this.
 As a frequent receiver of drunk messages they are not cute.
 Even when they're from Liz.
 Uh-duh-duh.
 Good Lord, I've "Lemoned" this situation with Nancy.
 I've got to erase that message.
 "Lemoned"? That's not a thing people are saying now, is it? Cerie? Pff"Lemoned".
 Doing it awesome.
 Here's the general idea, Jenna.
 You and I pretend that we met while filming a movie called Space Attack.
 My title.
 This movie will never be released because my performance will be deemed too provocative for America.
 I wish I lived in France.
 But out of this experience, we found each other, et cetera, et cetera.
 Five dates a week.
 One fight a month.
 And because of a product placement deal with Jamba Juice the fight will be in a Jamba Juice.
 I love Jamba Juice! And this is the Non-Disclosure Agreement regarding anything you two may learn about each other during the course of the relationship.
 Yeah, what exactly is Mr.
 Franco covering up here? Liz, are you familiar with Japanese "moe" relationships, where socially dysfunctional men develop deep emotional attachments to body pillows with women painted on them? I am not, James.
 Neither am I, Liz! Which is why it's so weird the tabloids are running all these stories saying I'm in love with a body pillow.
 I mean, it's crazy.
 Then why is that here? Why? I mean, why is this table here? I mean, why is that lamp here? Kimiko is It is here like any other object.
 Objects are made by men and used for many purposes.
 But we never love objects.
 Where do I sign? Hello? Liz, it's Randy.
 Randy Lemon.
 Oh, hey, Randy, what's up? Uh, well, my parents and I are kind of fighting right now.
 Because you spilled orange soda on the couch? No, because of the gay thing.
 So, um, now, I'm here in New York.
 Wait, you're in New York? Yeah, I figured I'd come stay with my cool cousin Liz.
 Besides, what better place for me to be now that I'm a homo? Is that the one we call ourselves? No, get a cab.
 Okay, go to my apartment.
 Uh, okay.
 Uh, actually, there's a guy here who offered to drive me if I help him move a couch into a van.
 Nope, that's a serial killer.
 Just get a cab, I'll pay for it.
 You have Amish here? Just get in the house, Randy.
 Kenneth.
 Jonathan.
 I need one of you to help me with a very special assignment.
 I hope it's me.
 But I'm honored just to be standing here with you.
 I'm going to drive up to Waltham, Massachusetts, break into a woman's home, and erase a potentially embarrassing and destructive answering machine message.
 The home in question has a doggie door.
 That will be our way in.
 Using these hangers prove that you are lithe enough to accompany me to Waltham.
 It's Kenneth! You sicken me.
 I did it! Angie just called, she's pregnant.
 That's awesome.
 Congratulations.
 Yes, and it gets better.
 I just had a burrito.
 Well, now, you just have to hope that it's a girl.
 I know it's a girl, Liz Lemon.
 Because I yelled, "Susan B.
 Anthony" at the moment of conception.
 Well, that'll do it.
 We're going to name her after the place that she was conceived.
 It was a pretty wild night.
 So we're going to name her either Virginia, NetJet, or Bathroom at Teterboro Airport.
 Virginia is nice.
 Oh, Liz.
 I'm in love! You're really not.
 James and I just had lunch at the Spotted Pig.
 The paparazzi were everywhere.
 The gossip blogs are calling us "James".
 It's a combination of "Jenna" and "James".
 Jenna, look, I'm glad that you're having fun, but is this really all that you want? I mean, you and I are not getting any younger.
 You don't know that thing I sleep in isn't working.
 Don't you want more than some fake boyfriend? Don't you want to be happy? Oh, Liz, I am happy.
 All this attention, getting my picture taken, having ice-cold diarrhea from drinking too much Jamba Juice.
 It's everything I ever wanted.
 Sorry, sir.
 That happens sometimes when I unhinge my pelvis.
 Oh, I was afraid of this.
 There's not an answering machine.
 It's a voicemail.
 Okay, well, we just need to look for clues to her password.
 It will be like The Da Vinci Code.
 Albino monk! That's a mirror, Kenneth.
 She must have written it down somewhere.
 Try on the computer.
 Okay.
 Search.
 Oops, I just took my picture with that little camera thingy.
 Kenneth! All right, I just need to erase that picture.
 Whoops, I just made it the desktop image.
 How did I do that? Wait a minute.
 Wait a minute.
 Nancy's husband has been sleeping on the couch.
 "Emailing image to address book"? What is wrong with me? Hey, Liz.
 Oh, thank God.
 Randall Lemon, where were you? I'm sorry.
 I met these two guys, and they just dropped me off.
 Well, I'm glad they brought you home, but That's where I'm meeting them later! A bar called Home Butt.
 Nope, you're not.
 You came to New York to see your cool cousin.
 Not run around with strange gentlemen.
 Jeez, you don't have to be so protective of me.
 This is New York City, Randy.
 Liz, do you know how hard it was growing up gay in Methenburg, Pennsylvania? The local T.
V.
 Station edited Will and Grace down so much that it was just called Karen.
 Being in New York, this is the first time I've ever felt like myself.
 And I want to go out and enjoy it.
 Have fun.
 Oh, we're going to have fun.
 We're going to stay here and make nachos and see who can fall asleep the earliest! Fun, fun, fun, fun! This is nice.
 Your hand feels like a pillow that's been in the microwave.
 Thanks.
 Okay, well, I'll see you tomorrow.
 Wait.
 Oh, It's okay.
 You can stop.
 I was wrong.
 What? I thought there was a paparazzo, but it's just some loser taking a picture of his kid.
 Oh, right.
 Of course.
 That was fake.
 Did you know "paparazzo" is the singular of "paparazzi"? Kimiko taught me that.
 I'll see you at dawn so you can get caught coming out of my apartment.
 I'll loan you a shirt.
 Try to look like you just got drilled.
 You know the deal.
 Sir, this computer is not helping with our search.
 If you type "Nancy's Secrets" into the internet, do you have any idea what comes up? A store that sells wig extensions.
 I've seen all this before, Kenneth.
 The separate beds, the empty closets, the brave, public face.
 This is just another Irish Catholic couple who won't admit to the world that their marriage is over.
 Sir, you don't know that.
 They're on vacation together right now.
 Are they? Nancy Donovan.
 Still so organized.
 In German class, Mr.
 Kruger always chose her to sort the students.
 He was eventually arrested by Israeli commandos.
 Mm.
 Look.
 On the 30th, she took Flight 1470 to R.
S.
W.
 He left the next day for C.
V.
G.
 They have to be different cities.
 Uh, Fort Myers and Cincinnati.
 Did you not learn your nation's airport codes in high school? She's at the beach house alone.
 That's the most divorced sentence I've ever heard.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, this snooping has to stop.
 We came here to erase Oh! I just took a picture of both of us.
 Good morning.
 Is that glitter? Oh, my God.
 Did you go out last night after I won the sleeping contest? I forgot to wash my face, didn't I? I meant to do it at the club.
 But when I got into the bathroom, everything started up again.
 Okay, that's it.
 I am taking you to the Port Authority.
 To get on a bus home.
 Not to meet people.
 God.
 Look, you've had your fun.
 You've seen New York.
 You've made some really neat friends.
 But maybe that's enough for a first step, okay? Yeah, okay.
 You're right.
 But I'm not going home until I give my cool cousin a makeover.
 Is it going to be fierce? It would be if it was 2006.
 Well, I do have this one cardigan that I've been kind of afraid to wear.
 Well, let's see it, girl.
 It has funny buttons, and ugh the draft is I'm not going back to Methenburg! Randy Lemon, you open this door right now! Okay, I do appreciate the irony that I'm the one stuck in the closet now.
 Is that irony? Not really! The sun is up, and we are still in these people's home.
 God can see us now.
 We have to find that voicemail code.
 It's on the dry-erase board above the phone.
 What? I saw it there a few hours ago.
 But I wasn't done looking around.
 I'm ready to hear the message now.
 Sir, I don't mean to swear, but I am irritated right now.
 Thursday, December 30th.
 Thursday, December Friday, January 1st.
 3:42 A.
 M.
 Meine liebe, Gretta.
 It's Klaus.
 Remember Mr.
 Kruger's German class? I took it to be with you.
 Sat behind you so I could talk to you and try to see the top of your underwear.
 You were Gretta.
 And I was Klaus.
 Jack, are you coming in? I'm on the phone! Get back in the hot tub! Ballard, don't let them put their tops back on! I'm, going to say goodnight with help from the poet, Rilke.
 Because only German can capture what seeing you again has made me feel.
 "Aus unendlichen Sehns, chten steigen endliche Taten wie schwache Fontnen.
" Auf wiedersehen, Gretta.
 To erase, press seven.
 To save, press nine.
 For more options, press four.
 Sir, what are you doing? Erase it.
 I don't know.
 I thought I wanted a clean break.
 But if that message is how I really feel, maybe she was supposed to hear it? Her marriage is falling apart.
 We meet again after all these years.
 Message deleted.
 Next message.
 Mr.
 Donaghy Whatever's happening here, it is not your place to interfere.
 If Mrs.
 Dougherty wanted you in her life, she would have called, given you some sign.
 But she hasn't.
 Let it go, sir.
 You're right, Kenneth.
 But you are leaving through the doggie door.
 Yes, sir.
 Hey, Liz.
 We're playing the Today show drinking game.
 You do a shot every time they give a dumb travel tip.
 I like to take the shampoo and put it in the little travel-sized bottles.
 Then I take the original bottle and put it back in the shower.
 For later.
 Yeah! Thank you for coming.
 Liz, relationship emergency.
 Why are you wearing a man's shirt and no pants? Last night, James kissed me.
 And for a second, I forgot it was fake.
 And it was incredible.
 Now having lunch with James and the actress who plays my mom somehow seems hollow.
 What's wrong with me? Jenna, what you're feeling is good.
 This thing with James is fun and exciting, but it isn't real.
 Deep down, I think you want to be with someone you really love.
 And who can love you back.
 More friends on the plaza this morning.
 Hi, guys, are you celebrating? We're in love! Trent's quitting the Navy and we're going to get married in Massachusetts! Wow, congratulations.
 Oh, boy.
 If you want to save money on the trip, consider taking a sandwich.
 Give them a hand.
 Hey, baby.
 You new here? Yeah, this is my first show.
 Uh-huh.
 And before you worked here, were you an ass scientist? Because your ass blah-blah-blah.
 You get the point.
 So what's your name? Virginia.
 Virginia? But that's going to be my daughter's name.
 Are you also someone's daughter? Uh, yeah.
 Is every woman someone's daughter? Of course.
 Uh-oh! No way.
 I was wrong, sir! There is a sign! She's been thinking about you for years! Why can't you be more like Kenneth? Go on.
 Her code.
 Do you know what it means? Well, it's not a date.
 The first numbers are too high.
 It's not the numbers, sir.
 It's the letters.
 They spell "Klaus".
 Your name in German class.
 The class you were in with Nancy.
 In high school.
 Back in Massachu I get it, Kenneth.
 I'm just trying to figure out my next move.
 I have to play it cool.
 You should buy a leather jacket! Get Cerie in here.
 Not you.
 Pack your stuff.
 You know, I don't think this is about you protecting me.
 I think you have a problem with people enjoying themselves.
 Why did you even leave White Haven, Liz? When was the last time you watched the sun rise? Sometimes, at work.
 Or kissed a boy you just met? Gross.
 Or went dancing? I'm not going home until I make you appreciate living here.
 Tonight, we are going to do that makeover for real.
 And then, I'm taking you out.
 Yeah, okay, fine.
 I mean, who am I to tell Jenna that she doesn't know how to be happy when I can't even figure out my own Stop.
 So bored.
 Did I do that right? Yeah, that was super bitchy.
 You can't just break up with me.
 I'll sue you for breach of contract.
 Oh, you, you're being such a non-pillow right now! But don't you understand? I just want something real in my life for once.
 I want what you have with Kimiko.
 Kimiko-tan.
 What am I doing, Jenna? Pretending to be something I'm not.
 Making myself miserable when I've got happiness waiting for me at home.
 Unless Kimiko's jealous of the ottoman.
 There's nothing going on there.
 That's a business relationship.
 Don't "Lemon" your life, James.
 Be happy.
 I'm the actor, James Franco, damn it.
 And I'm in love with and common-law married to a Japanese body pillow.
 And I hope you had a good New Years's.
 Uh, let me know the next time you and Mark are in New York and we'll all grab dinner.
 Auf wiedersehen.
 Liz.
 James.
 Wow, you look great! Is Jenna here? No, Jenna and I broke up, actually.
 We both decided it was time to be happy.
 Me too! I'm saying yes to life! Okay.
 Let's do this.
 Hey, you got home late.
 Yeah, I, um Randy, this is James Franco.
 And our friend, Kimiko-tan.
 Hey, Randy.
 I'm going to go to the bus station now.
 I think that's for the best.
 I blame you three for my unhealthy attitude towards women! You have created an atmosphere of hostility and intolerance that everyone talks about all the time! Grizz, when was the last time you told your fiancee you love her? Since the phone call I interrupted to make this announcement! Kenneth, your haircut is disrespectful to lesbians.
 Dotcom, do you ever read books by women? But George Eliot was a woman.
 Enough! I've made a decision.
 And starting next week, I'm adding a woman to the entourage! Really?   

                




                    			Good show tonight, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Hey, Kenneth.
 Why aren't your teeth glowing in the black light? You'll have to ask the fellow who whittled them for me.
 It's her, isn't it? I don't kiss and tell, Jack.
 Ah, because you're a gentleman, Danny.
 It's good to finally have another one of us around here.
 I'm just happy to be here.
 A month ago, I was doing a robot act on the street, so I know my place.
 I want to be T.
G.
S.
 's Steve Nash, Come down from Canada, work hard, make the black guy look good.
 Did you just make a sports reference? Do you know how little of that I get here? Look at me in the black light! It's Tron! Watch out, Sark, It's me, Flynn! Ar Light bike.
 Good job tonight, Danny.
 Robot Lorenzo Lamas was funny.
 As was Robot Ryan Seacrest and David Hasselbot.
 Hey, it's the writing.
 It's really not.
 So now that Danny's here, you actually come to the after parties? It's nice to have another man around for once.
 Oh, there are other men Oh, boy.
 It's not what you think! It's something I need to wear to support my breasts! Lemon, I have season tickets to every sports team in New York, so close to the action, you feel like you're sitting in front of an H.
D.
 Television.
 And they're wasted on you and your coworkers.
 Why won't they put me on the Jumbotron? I've been doing cool stuff all game.
 Whoo! But my biggest problem with Quidditch is if the snitch is 150 points, why does anyone bother with the quaffle? Hey, Jeter! Are you jealous? I'm with my new boyfriend! And now that Danny's here, I have someone to do guy stuff with.
 Have actual male conversations.
 You know, he confided in me that he's got a little something going with one of the girls here.
 Maybe it's that Russian dancer with the tattoos.
 Which is the crazy sex trifecta.
 That girl has a name, Jack.
 We call her "Skankovich".
 I'm sure you disapprove.
 But the workplace is a hierarchy, and Danny is a star.
 All the pretty, little things down here always want to be with the people up here.
 Whatever, as long as he's discreet about it.
 It's a younger man's game, Lemon.
 But I can't say that I don't miss it.
 You'd be in your office late at night, and the new girl would come in with some flimsy excuse to be there.
 "Oh, Mr.
 Donaghy, I forgot to give you the factory worker death rates.
" Then, she'd laugh at your lame joke.
 A touch on the arm.
 And you'd take your reward.
 You'd take your reward.
 How drunk are you? A lot to very.
 Boy, that robot body paint does not wash off.
 Is it the body paint? Or is Danny just glowing like a beacon of manly camaraderie? Oh, God.
 I'm extremely drunk.
 Oh, my Hey, we've got to get Danny out by 5:00 today.
 I guess Jack's taking him to the Knicks game.
 Liz, I can't do girls' lunch today.
 We've never done that.
 Because I have an audition for Gossip Girl.
 Oh, I love that show.
 I play Tartine Gramercy.
 An heiress to a vermouth fortune and a freshman at N.
Y.
U.
 Really? A college freshman? That's right.
 In the scene they gave me, I'm fighting with my mother, a washed-up actress who's clinging to her last scraps of faded glamour.
 Uh-huh.
 It's interesting they've highlighted the mother's lines.
 Well, that's so I'll know what part not to read.
 As if the word "mother" didn't tip me off already.
 Wish me luck.
 We really should have said something.
 What happens when she gets there and finds out she's the mom? Oh, Pete, that's later.
 Maybe we'll be dead by then.
 Oh, that'd be great.
 Sue, you're probably wondering why we asked you to join the entourage.
 Well, over the years, I've had a complicated relationship with women.
 From my treatment of the dancers here to my remarks about Madeleine Albright at the 1996 White House Correspondents' Dinner.
 What? It's true! She does look like one of those! Now that Mr.
 Jordan is having a daughter, he wants to learn to give all women the respect they deserve.
 Even you foreigners.
 That's why I'm adding a daughter to the entourage family.
 Now what's on the schedule for today? from his trip to Greece.
 I think I'm going to go ahead and cancel that.
 Okay, I'll reschedule.
 Again.
 I'll get the car.
 Hey, hang on.
 No, I don't think we should go to a strip club.
 It just doesn't feel right.
 I think we should let the new member choose an activity.
 I like to go to Tasti D-Lite.
 I said we're not going to a strip club.
 Pinkberry? What don't you understand? I don't want to take you to a strip club! Oh, come on, you hoser! Hoser! So what did you do after the party the other night? Well, my, uh, work friend and I went to her office.
 Ooh, she has an office.
 Hey, is it that chick lawyer who does the sexual harassment presentation? Because she's asking for it.
 Okay, no more guesses, continue.
 All right, so we're getting into it, and she takes off her glasses.
 Real sexy.
 Nice.
 But she never takes off her shoes, which I kind of like.
 Even though the reason is she's never let a man see her feet.
 What? And she's kind of a tease.
 Mostly we just kiss, and then, she makes me go down to the deli to get her a sandwich.
 So we haven't gone too far.
 But under that dress, I can tell she's wearing some weird underwear.
 I want to see it.
 They're called "Spanx".
 Hello.
 Jenna, thanks so much for coming in.
 This is Archeria, She'll be reading with you.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 Okay, Tartine has just discovered videos of her boyfriend on her mother's online sex diary.
 Mother, is there something I don't know about you and Wainwright? What are you doing? Sorry, let's start over.
 Mother, is there something I don't Jenna, you're reading the wrong lines.
 What do you mean? I'm not playing the mo You wanted to see me? Close the door, Lemon.
 So we haven't talked about your personal life lately.
 Anything new going on there? No, same old nothing.
 Nothing, really? That's too bad.
 'Cause you know what I always say.
 Black light attack! What? Oh, boy.
 That stuff does not wash off.
 You and Danny? I would have guessed anyone else.
 Jenna, Sue All right, come on.
 How is this possible? Well, I don't know if you know this, Jack, but the workplace is a hierarchy.
 And I'm Danny's boss.
 Sometimes, all the pretty little things down here want to be with the people up here.
 And they come into your office late one night with some flimsy excuse.
 Hey, Liz.
 I just want to show you this new iPhone app.
 You shake it and it sounds like an empty can.
 Huh? My favorite "apps" are the ones before my entree.
 Oh, my God.
 That is the funniest thing I've ever heard.
 So what are you up to right now? And I took my reward.
 Lemon, you need to end this now.
 What? No.
 Jack, you were just talking about how you miss office hook-ups.
 That is a double standard.
 Calm down.
 No, I won't calm down.
 Women are allowed to get angrier than men about double standards.
 It's not about that.
 Yes, I've had office relationships in the past.
 But always with people that I could transfer to another city or introduce to Nicolas Sarkozy.
 Danny is on your show.
 Yeah, but it's not serious.
 It's not serious yet.
 End it before it starts affecting the show.
 Ugh, fine.
 I'll talk to him when he gets in.
 What did he do to the back of your knees? A lady never tells.
 Hey, blondie.
 You like Italian ice? Hey, watch your mouth! She's only 34 years old! K What's wrong with me? First, I don't want to go to strip clubs.
 And then I get angry at that hilarious dude that said something awesome.
 There's nothing wrong with you, sir.
 It's just, you're treating Sue like family now.
 It makes you feel protective of her.
 But I'm not like that with my sons.
 When they were little, I threw them in the deep end of our pool.
 To help them get over their fear of sharks.
 Well, it's different with girls.
 You want to protect them from the world.
 I'm proud of you, sir.
 It's like a whole, new part of your heart has opened up.
 Thank God.
 'Cause the doctors keep telling me it's pretty clogged.
 The mother.
 They wanted me to play the mother.
 Oh, boy, okay, here we go.
 Hey, Pete! Jenna just got the A mother? I'm not a mother.
 Would a mother be planning a sex tour of Vietnam this spring? Okay, just Look, you're a beautiful woman.
 But you can't play prom queens and murdered runaways forever.
 But those were my majors at the Royal Tampa Academy of Dramatic Tricks.
 You can try to fight getting older.
 You can be like Madonna, and cling to youth with you Gollum arms.
 Or you can be like Meryl Streep and embrace your age with elegance.
 So you're saying it's a choice.
 Between the dignity of middle age and the illusion of youth.
 Two paths.
 Meryl Streep.
 Or Madonna.
 Very well, I will emulate my acting inspiration.
 A woman of profound poise, whose career is what we all aspire to.
 Okay, this build-up is making me nervous.
 A woman whose feminine grace and normal outfits are an inspiration.
 Just say who it is and I'll feel better.
 Someone whose very name stands for enduring beauty and the wonder of womanhood.
 Please don't say Madonna.
 Hey, Danny.
 Hey, Liz.
 Look, I know we're supposed to pre-tape that Robot V Wade cold open tonight, But Jack said I can skip it and go to the Rangers game with him.
 Yeah, sure, you can go.
 But, um, we have to talk.
 Okay.
 Richard, would you excuse us, please? What's up? Meet me in my office in five minutes.
 Well, just let me change.
 Mmm No, That won't be necessary, officer.
 What are you happy about? Did we get cancelled? Can't a girl just be happy? Oh, no, Jenna.
 Don't do this.
 Hang on, I'm just tweeting that I ran into you.
 This is so tandem.
 "Random", Jenna.
 Those kids are saying the word "random".
 Ow! Come on, you guys, stop it! Turn it off, Frank.
 What's going on? What are you doing to Cerie? Frank downloaded this high-pitched tone that can only be heard by young ears.
 They use it in Japan to keep kids from loitering outside of convenience stores.
 Cerie's the only one who can hear it.
 The rest of us are too old.
 Oh, not me! I can hear it! Ugh, my ears are, like, dying! Ah, Facebook! Um, I already turned it off.
 I also have this low-frequency tone that can only be heard by people over 40.
 Have you started playing it yet? Ah.
 Lemon, can I speak with you for a moment? What is happening to me? Danny and I were supposed to have lunch today.
 Why didn't he show up? I don't know, maybe he had something better to do.
 Well, I had a Porterhouse for Two alone.
 I am very angry and sleepy.
 This is from Danny's CHiPs costume.
 What is it doing here? Officer, what's going on up there? It's an accident.
 A really bad one.
 This badge is a symbol of dignity, honor, and dramatized 1970s inter-ethnic California daytime motorcycle highway justice.
 I'm sorry, Jack.
 I changed my mind.
 I'm trying to look out for the show here, Lemon.
 Yeah, I don't think you are.
 While stuck in a pile-up on the Pacific Coast Highway earlier, I realized something.
 You take Danny away from work whenever you want to hang out.
 I don't think this is about the show.
 I think you have some sort of problem with the fact that Danny is with me.
 For four years, I've had to make do with what passes for men in this place.
 With their untucked shirts, boneless faces, their Stars, both Wars and Trek.
 I needed a man around here, and I finally have one.
 No, I finally have one.
 Liz Lemon has a handsome, goof-around, make-out buddy.
 And that's the problem.
 Danny can't be my alpha-male wingman and his boss' little "scrump nugget".
 They're incompatible.
 Well, then, I guess it's on.
 May the best man win.
 Oh, he will.
 Hey, where are you going? It's board game night.
 Out.
 Out? With whom? This guy, Doug.
 Well, does Doug have a last name? Okay, everybody, let's just You can't make me stay here.
 You are a part of this entourage.
 I didn't ask to be in this entourage! Look, I know you didn't mean that.
 I do mean it.
 I'm not like you! I'll never be like you! And now, I'm at the point where I love just kissing.
 We kiss for an hour and it's totally enough for me.
 Uh-huh, this is good guy talk.
 She has really thin lips, but she makes up for it with tongue girth.
 Okay, maybe we just watch the game.
 Forget about girls for a night.
 Whoo! You know, my little cuddle baby loves to watch figure skating, and I'm really starting to get into that.
 And now, turning to women's health.
 Our latest women's information on women's sexuality finds female libido does tend to peak in those years just before peri-menopause.
 What scientists and doctors like myself are calling their Dirty 30s.
 Women are also looking at the latest I've got to go, Jack.
 What? You're leaving? It's only zero-zero.
 I'll talk to you in the morning.
 Liz Lemon.
 That was a low blow last night, Lemon.
 What can I say, Jack? I guess I'm getting a second wind here at the tail end of my "dirty 30s".
 This whole week has been such a bummer.
 Hey, when did we add this Grizzly Adams sketch? I wrote it last night.
 Late.
 The shirt should be filthier.
 If you were a man, you would have to register yourself as a sex criminal.
 I'm taking Danny back.
 Oh, good luck with that.
 And remember, if it doesn't work out, there's always Lutz.
 # Forever young # # I want to be forever young # Jenna, stop it.
 Ow.
 Look, you claim that you want to be happy.
 But that's never going to happen until you are honest about who you are.
 That's easy for you to say.
 I've built my career on a certain image.
 And you have no idea what I go through to maintain it.
 The workouts, the lotions, pretending I wasn't fourth runner-up at the Miss Teen Bicentennial Pageant.
 Hm, that's And you don't understand the fear I live with.
 The fear of people ever seeing the real me.
 Yes, I do.
 We all have secrets.
 You know that I have something I've been hiding from the world for 20 years.
 What are you talking about? If you come out as your real age, I will reveal my friend, Tom.
 You would do that for me? How long would it take? Well, if I do nothing, he'll be here within 48 hours.
 Ow.
 Good morning, Li Oh, my God.
 I'd like you all to meet Tom.
 Tom Selleck.
 He's my moustache.
 Thank you, Liz.
 It's funny.
 All my "a-ha" moments end with a moustache pressed against me.
 There you are! Your Kenneth and I were worried sick about you! I think Doug put something in my drink, and I don't remember That's not important anymore.
 I want to talk to you about our fight the other night.
 Look, having a girl in your life is different.
 You want to protect her.
 And the best that you can hope for is that, someday, a nice man will come and take her from you.
 That's it.
 Hey, Sue.
 I need you in the writers' room.
 Here he is now.
 I knew this day would come.
 I just didn't think it would be so soon.
 You take good care of her.
 # Forever young # # I want to be forever young # # Do you really want to live forever # # Forever and ever # # Forever young # # I want to be forever young # I don't know if I can go through this with a real daughter.
 Yes, you can.
 I know that was hard, but I bet you wouldn't give up this week with Ms.
 LaRoche Vanderhoot for anything.
 No, I wouldn't.
 Not for a billion doll hairs.
 I'm sorry, did you say, "doll hairs"? Yeah, they're not worth nothing.
 You could probably sell them to a doll company and get maybe $40,000 for them.
 Danny.
 Danny, I know.
 I know Liz is your secret work girlfriend.
 Ah, I wanted to tell you.
 But she thought we should be discreet.
 I mean, we're just having fun.
 I know.
 But you need to end it now.
 What? Why? I never told anyone this.
 And that's why, if you ask people about it, they won't know what you're talking about.
 Because it's a secret.
 Not because it's a lie.
 Okay, I understand.
 Good, now here's my secret.
 My secret is I'm in love with Liz Lemon.
 What? It's true.
 It was love at first sight.
 I ache for her sexually.
 How could I not? I'm entranced by those mud-colored eyes, set back in that skin.
 And her laugh.
 Her walk.
 That splay-footed walk.
 And that whole situation.
 Right there.
 And Oh Moustache.
 Good God, Lemon.
 Jack, I had no idea.
 I mean, the last thing I want to do is screw up our friendship.
 Me and Liz? I'll end it today.
 You'd do that for me? Whoa! Yeah, I think I'll be okay.
 Ugh! Oh, Mother.
 I can't believe you're dying of old age.
 Don't cry for me, Tartine.
 I've had a full life.
 Oh, the things I've seen.
 The first Clinton administration.
 The Nagano Olympics.
 Microsoft Windows '95.
 But I'm 41 now.
 Time to die.
 And cut! So Danny says that he and I can't hook up anymore.
 And I am taking him to the fight at the Garden tomorrow night.
 I guess the best man won.
 Uh-huh, well, the reason that he gave me was that someone else here is in love with me.
 It was my only move, Lemon.
 And it was hard, believe me.
 What did you say you loved about me? Did you talk about my body? Did you say how you like to watch me dance? Yeah.
 You like that? You're embarrassing yourself, Lemon.
 It started out as a joke, but it's becoming real.
 I don't care! I'm having a good time! Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go, Lutz.
 Go to work, Lutz!   

                




                    			Good morning, Lemon.
 Ugh, I hate January.
 It's dark and freezing and everyone's wearing bulky coats, so you can do some serious subway flirting before you realize the guy is homeless.
 Work is awful.
 Everyone's snippy and tense.
 Well, the lack of sun makes people depressed.
 It's called Seasonal Affective Disorder.
 Oh, is that where the word "sad" comes from? What? You think "sad" is an acronym invented by psychologists? I've been stuck inside playing online Boggle.
 It's messing with my head.
 Star, rats, arts, tars.
 Ah, it's from Nancy.
 She said she's in line behind the female Larry Bird.
 Oh, God.
 There's a photo.
 Oh, come on.
 How is female Larry Bird holding hands with a guy? What am I doing wrong? What's that for? I'm telling Nancy that I'm with female Kevin McHale.
 So what's going on with you and Nancy, anyway? We're just friends.
 It's platonic.
 I have elaborate fantasies of her husband dying in a boat explosion.
 But she's getting divorced, right? Well, she hasn't mentioned it.
 It's not the sort of thing you discuss by text or email.
 Well, this is my stop.
 Stop, pots, tops Opts, post.
 Morning, Kenneth.
 Good morning, Miss Lemon.
 I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean to snap at you.
 I've got Winter Madness.
 Lutz? Do the right thing.
 What's going on? It's Lutz's turn to pick where we eat today.
 Oh, boy.
 Lutz, don't do this.
 But it's my turn to pick.
 I'm the picker.
 Lutz, look at me.
 It's a long year.
 Think of the group.
 Subway.
 Whoa, guys! Calm down! I know we're all tired and cranky.
 But we've just got to get to the end of the season.
 And hey, who knows? Maybe some people won't be coming back next year.
 I don't care.
 Worth it.
 Oh, hello.
 Hey, Jack.
 Going to the octopus.
 Nancy, I'm sorry, the audio's bad.
 Jonathan, why do I have an Indian assistant if my computer is always Jack I'm messing with you.
 Oh, very funny, Donova Oh, the computer froze.
 Nice.
 So, uh To what do I owe the pleasure? I wanted to tell you I'm coming down to New York.
 Oh, really? When? June 5th.
 For my son's graduation.
 So five months from now.
 Okay.
 Well, maybe you'll come up here before then? Well, my 25th reunion from Harvard Business School is June 5th.
 That's too bad.
 Well, I should go.
 I've got to scrape the icicles off the gutters.
 I'm tired of waking up to a porch full of dead squirrels.
 God, I miss Boston.
 See you.
 Liz, I have an idea.
 Something to boost morale.
 Pete, no.
 I listened to you when you wanted to take the staff to see that r-rated hypnotist, and that sucked.
 He was pretty bad.
 Nutmeg.
 No, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo.
 Look, I think we can take the show to Miami for a week.
 What? Can we afford to do that? If we do it on the cheap, double up rooms.
 Think about it, Liz.
 Florida.
 I can rent a covertible.
 You can complain about the heat with elderly people.
 I can sell this to Jack.
 Cross promotional.
 Deal mechanics.
 Revenue streams.
 Jargon.
 Synergy.
 That's the best presentation I've ever seen.
 Get started right away.
 One little thing.
 Instead of Miami, make it Boston.
 But I I bought a parrot shirt.
 Whoo! Okay, exciting news, guys.
 This week, T.
G.
 S.
 Is going on the road! There's a rumor that it's Miami, is it Miami? Close.
 It is a city with an N.
B.
A.
 Team.
 And even though Will Smith never wrote any raps about it the poet, Robert Lowell, lived there.
 Okay, we're going to Boston, no one's happy about it.
 It's freezing! No, no, no, it's going to be fun.
 How? Their bars close at 2:00.
 You know, I went to college in Boston.
 Well, not in Boston, but nearby.
 No, not Tufts.
 Shut up.
 It's 14 degrees up there.
 How is that supposed to make us feel better? Harvard.
 You have been told to shut up.
 Come on, silver lining! It's a fun vacation on the show's dime.
 FYI, to pay for this vacation, we need to cut some corners.
 So we will be doubling up hotel rooms and we are going by bus.
 Also, there is no SpectraVision or internet in the hotel so plan ahead, gentlemen.
 Porn-wise.
 Did Pete just say we're doubling up rooms? Did he? Oh, this is the worst.
 What if, uh, you and I roomed together? Oh, no, Toofer and I already talked about it.
 You can't have talked about it! You just said you didn't even know about it! You think I like sharing a room with Toofer? Dude is still playing that Obama song.
 And yeah, I know you're standing there! Hey, fellows.
 We're getting Tracy his own room, so I assume you two will pair up? Why would you just assume we would room together? Why would he assume we wouldn't? I don't know.
 Maybe because one of us still hasn't read the other's screenplay.
 I read it.
 I just didn't like it.
 Hey, Cerie.
 I thought you and I could be roommates.
 Go out, meet guys, share clothes like twinsies.
 What size are you? Usually, designers just make clothes for me.
 But when I do buy stuff, I'm a child's medium.
 Well, I only wear designer labels.
 These are Jamie Foxx for Assfarm.
 But I can't room with you.
 Sue and I already talked about it.
 Why? You know Sue says stuff about you behind your back.
 What, she always says stuff to me about you.
 Wait what? I was making my thing up.
 You bitch.
 What did you tell her, you vondruke? Liz Lemon, I can't go to Boston.
 Oh, Tracy, come on.
 You don't understand.
 I get in trouble on the road.
 Thank you, thank you.
 It's great to be here in Cleveland.
 You suck.
 I suck? The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame sucks.
 Hello.
 The road is a minefield, L.
L.
 All those angry drunks and new temptations? Yeah, I don't know what to tell you.
 This Boston thing is Jack's idea.
 That stupid, Irish, piece of Oh, boy.
 Boston is not going to go well.
 # WBHD Boston # Hey, leave him alone! Stop it! Miss Lemon, these gentlemen are the writers for Bruins Beat, whose offices we'll be sharing.
 They're all named Sean, they are mean, and I hate it here.
 Liz, Mr.
 Donaghy would like to see you in his office.
 What, what? Boys, come on.
 Ow! Liz, Liz, help! Liz, Liz! You've got to be kidding me.
 What, are you not using an office replication service while we're here in Boston? Is it identical? Not quite.
 Seven items are different.
 See if you can spot which ones.
 So how's the show looking for Friday? Like it may not happen, actually.
 Well, that will really disappoint your key demographic of drunken 11-year-olds.
 Look, I know for you, this is all just a way to meet married ladies, but it is my job.
 Let me give you some advice on uniting a divided people.
 Find a common enemy.
 A common enemy.
 For example, what keeps people polite on airplanes? A shared hatred of the C.
B.
S.
 Sitcoms they're forced to watch.
 No, I understand the concept.
 Because with these dummies, the common enemy is always me.
 And I'm sick of it.
 I'm not going to be the bad guy this time.
 Then find someone else.
 I recommend Lutz.
 Why do I always want to choke that guy? You just do.
 But that's not my Am I interrupting? Of course not.
 Oh.
 You're not a part of this, Liz.
 Why didn't you tell me you were coming up here? I wanted it to be a surprise.
 I hope that you, and, of course, Mark will come to the show on Friday.
 I can't believe I'm in the same building as Bruins Beat.
 Come on, give me a tour.
 Of course.
 Ooh, actually, I'm going to tag along.
 I still haven't had a formal tour of the facility.
 Zzt.
 So I'm going to stay here.
 Why the long face? Your boss there making your life miserable? It's complicated, Sean.
 I know what it's like.
 I'm the head writer of Bruins Beat.
 Trying to have it all? It's wicked hard.
 Is this where they do the news? Small, isn't it? I've found that news anchors and breasts are always smaller than they look on T.
V.
 You can try it.
 I feel like Chet Curtis and Natalie Jacobson.
 Tonight's top story.
 A Worcester man accused of trading his foster son for gasoline.
 And later in the hour, 10 tips on how to make your cat's birthday go "Purr-fectly Back to you, Nat.
 Nancy, are you okay? Oh, God.
 I swore I wasn't going to cry in front of you.
 Mark left.
 Yesterday.
 He took a job in New Orleans.
 What? What about his roofing company? Apparently, Brad Pitt and Sharon Stone did a crap job re-building those Katrina homes.
 Mark thinks that he can make a fortune down there.
 But I know the real reason he left.
 He wants to force me to be the one to ask for the divorce.
 So you guys are having problems? I'm sorry.
 Oh, Jack, it's a mess.
 Suddenly, he has his own bank account.
 We've had our house on the market for a year.
 And neither one of us know what to do about the dog, because we both hate it.
 Have you talked openly about divorce? Yeah, we talked to Dr.
 Phil And then we made a collage in our dream journals.
 No.
 You know how it is up here.
 People don't talk.
 They just run off to New Orleans and jump on that B.
S.
 Saints bandwagon.
 Go Pats.
 Oh, Donovan, I hate seeing you like this.
 Well, I've got to get going.
 I've got an open house tomorrow.
 And Mark was supposed to shovel the walk and salt the carport.
 I can barely understand you, but let me help while I'm here.
 Do you know how to re-wire a doorbell? I do if you can resuscitate an electrocuted person.
 Can you wire the doorbell to the dog? Okay, that's lunch! Dude, why do you keep fixing my spelling? We're back in at 3:00.
 No, 3:30.
 Enjoy the town, everyone! You're welcome.
 Now who would like to join me on a morale-boosting tour of Boston's historic Freedom Trail? Ooh, I would.
 "N't.
" Now what am I supposed to do? I've got free time in a strange city.
 Why don't you come on the Freedom Trail with me? It's an educational walking tour.
 "Purr-fect"! Like a cat birthday! How can I possibly get in trouble on a walking tour? Smash cut to And I, John Hancock, with one stroke of my pen, set all Americans free.
 You lying, white devil! The only people you set free were rich, white dudes like yourself! I think my good friend and supervisor, Paul Revere, can address that.
 I'm out, Kenny.
 Hey, you know what? We're gonna go.
 Man, no! Most dudes that signed the Declaration of Independence owned slaves! What about you, John Hancock? Well, technically, I just inherited my slaves.
 I knew it! For a dude that has the most hilarious last name I've ever heard, you blow! We didn't land on Plymouth Rock! Plymouth Rock landed on Mars! All right, give it a try.
 Okay.
 Ah, I have many other valuable skills.
 It'll be the new owner's problem.
 Just like the water heater.
 And the ghost.
 Well, it is a buyer's market right now.
 I think it'll turn around in the next year or so.
 Oh, I can't wait that long.
 I got to sell this place if I want to get divorced.
 What do you mean? Well, there's no money, Jack.
 If I can get some cash out of this place, then I can start a new life.
 Buy a condo in Marina Bay.
 Open a store for red-headed girls to buy cosmetics from someone who understands.
 So you need to sell this house to get divorced? Basically.
 You looking for a country estate in Waltham? There it is, see? Why did you even get to pick lunch again? Because it's my birthday.
 And thanks for remembering.
 I'm 45.
 It's kind of a big deal.
 Who orders food from a gas station? The Shell by me has good hot dogs.
 Guys, guys, come on.
 We're all in this together.
 Shut up, Liz! This is your fault.
 It's not my fault.
 I tried to do something nice.
 It was Jack Sure, find a scapegoat.
 Just like John Hancock did with the good King George.
 Jack made us come to Boston.
 This isn't about Boston.
 Boston was just the match that lit the powder keg.
 Like the tragic events at Lexington and Concord.
 That's right.
 We are sick of the long hours, the crappy food, sharing offices with the one black guy in New York who sucks.
 Getting stuck with new cast members who don't even hit on us once.
 Stop trying to send dirty text messages to my landline, Jenna! And the winter.
 Oh, Lord, the winter.
 Really, you're blaming me for winter? Well we've got to blame someone.
 Who's it going to be if it's not you? You want someone to blame? I'll give you someone to blame.
 Dale Snitterman.
 Okay, I'm out.
 Who the hell is Dale Snitterman? Dale Snitterman is the guy at N.
B.
C.
 Who makes all the decisions that make us unhappy.
 Snitterman is the one who cancelled taco night in the commissary.
 Snitterman is the one who okayed that cast photo where your hair looks green.
 He's the one who keeps rejecting your "summer shorts for the pages" idea.
 Sounds like one of King George's hated tax collectors.
 Exactly.
 Thank you, Tracy.
 You guys think I'm the bad guy? Fine, I don't care.
 But I fight for you every day.
 And if Dale Snitterman had his way, this show wouldn't even be on.
 That vondruke! And all we can do to get back at him is put on the best damn show that we can.
 And not give him the satisfaction of everybody turning on each other.
 Or me.
 I love you guys.
 You wanted to see the world's greatest manager? Is Kiyoshi Kawashima of Honda here? No, it's me.
 I'm a genius.
 I made up a fake N.
B.
C.
 Executive and blamed everything that has ever gone wrong on him.
 The imaginary enemy.
 Classic move, Lemon.
 The Salem Witch Trials, the Red Scare, global warming.
 Now that you've cleaned up your little mess, I'll need to borrow some of your people to go to an open house in Waltham for me.
 Charlie What-now? Nancy spilled everything.
 Her husband left.
 And they're getting divorced if she can find someone to buy their house.
 And that someone is you.
 I'm just going to be the money man.
 The transaction will be conducted by one of your staff, who will be operating under the alter ego Silas Marymount-Peppercorn.
 A name I came up with.
 Oh, you should have come to me for your fake name.
 My executive? Dale Snitterman.
 Amazing, Lemon.
 Where do you come up with this stuff? Well, you know, the creative process is always a mystery.
 I just wish I could get inside that marvelous brain of yours.
 Oh, wait, I can.
 Okay, in this instance, the creative process was that I saw that name, forgot that I saw it and said it later.
 Then, in 1754, I graduated from university here in Boston.
 Well, not in Boston, but nearby.
 No, not Tufts.
 Don't listen to him! We fell for his lies 300 years ago.
 Don't let this slave-owning time-traveler fool us again! Excuse me.
 John Hancock was a patriot.
 Then patriots are overrated.
 Hey! What'd you say about the Patriots? I said they suck! Uh-oh, here come the punches.
 This was all Snitterman's fault! Are you here for the open house? Hello, we are here from a different town for the open house, because we are interested in purchasing a house in this area.
 I'm Nancy, the owner.
 I am Silas Marymount-Peppercorn.
 And this is my first wife.
 Moronica.
 It's nice to meet you.
 I'm British.
 My wife and I have disparate levels of attractiveness, because I am a successful inventor.
 Well, I've got to be honest.
 I was wondering.
 Well, all right.
 It's a three bedroom.
 And a partially finished basement.
 Partially finished? I'll take it! Dudes! You're not going \to believe this.
 Snitterman is here! What? I was wandering around upstairs checking out the local cleaning lady talent and I found that son of a bitch's office! He's in Boston? We should go up there and mess him up for all the crap he's put us through.
 Right, Liz? Let's get him! Yeah! Okay, don't Okay Oh, boy.
 You little bitch! What? Look at you, you're just a suit.
 You're nobody.
 I don't even know why I was scared of this guy.
 Look, there must be some mistake.
 Don't try to explain yourself, Snitterman.
 You don't talk! You don't talk at all! Okay, I think he's really scared.
 We've done enough here.
 Never! Lutz, truffle-shuffle him! Truffle shuffle! Truffle shuffle! Truffle shuffle! Truffle shuffle! Yeah, take that, Snitterman! That's what you get for making us work late tonight! Yeah! We're working late tonight because of you! So how was the open house? Well, somebody actually came for once.
 Nice, young couple.
 Weird last name, though.
 I'm sure your name is weird to them.
 Uh, any reason to open this? Did they make an offer? No, they didn't.
 Really? Are you sure? Yeah, that house is never going to sell.
 I'm going to take it off the market and see what happens in a year or so.
 But what about your plans? The condo? The store for pale teens? I can't run a store and make change for people.
 Have another open house.
 I bet someone offers cash this time.
 Not with that broken doorbell.
 We'll have it fixed.
 No, I had an offer, okay? For 10 grand over the asking price.
 So what's the problem? The problem is that I've been married for 23 years.
 The dumb house was just an excuse to stay put.
 You know, I'm not ready for a new life, Jack.
 Not ready? Nancy, we're 50.
 Yeah, and that's too old to rush into anything.
 You know, you're not from here anymore.
 You know, down in New York, people are like, "Let's get divorced.
 "You marry the butler, and I'll be a gay Octomom.
" It's different here.
 People judge you.
 Who cares what people around here think? Your neighbors named their daughter Belichick! I don't want to talk about it anymore.
 Of course you don't want to talk about it, you repressed, Irish maniac.
 Don't want to talk about it! You must know that I have feelings for you.
 No, not talking! And I don't want to pressure you, but if you were divorced No, let's go to Kelly's.
 Let's get some roast beef.
 Nancy, let me talk.
 I'll give you two words.
 Ten.
 Four, final offer.
 I'll wait.
 Not forever.
 I'll try.
 Wicked hard.
 Tracy, there you are! I want you to meet my fellow revolutionary and dear friend, Crispus Attucks.
 So you can see, John Hancock has black friends.
 Uh-huh.
 And when did you two meet? Why, we met at the Sons of Liberty gathering.
 Uh, when was that, Crispus? Really? So five years after Crispus Attucks was killed in the Boston Massacre? Run, Crispus! He's on to us!   

                




                    			I never thought this day would come, Lizzie.
 Okay, push! Push, Liz Lemon! Here comes your baby! Congratulations! It's Meat Cat! The Cheesy Blasters mascot.
 I'm what's inside you.
 Razzmatazz.
 I've got to eat better.
 Oh, hello, Mr.
 Hornberger.
 I thought I was the only one here at this hour.
 No, this is just my little ritual so I can have a moment of peace and quiet between home, where this happened, And work, where I'm always being interrupted.
 Oh, I get it.
 A little "Pete Time", pardon the familiarity.
 Well, you just enjoy your coffee, sir, while I tell you a funny story about my friend's cat.
 His name is Mister Wiggles, and his cat's name is Benson.
 Where's Liz? I need to speak to her right away.
 I guess that's the end of "Pete and Kenneth Time".
 Liz, she's here.
 Verna's here.
 My mother is downstairs.
 Are you sure? I didn't see her, security called.
 She was trying to use an oxycontin prescription bottle as I.
D.
 That's Verna.
 Oh So is she coming up? Are you kidding? I told them to throw her off the property.
 But I'm sure she's down there sitting on the curb, chain smoking and waiting for me to come out.
 Just like the day I was born.
 Wow, look, Jenna, I know that she's no prize, but no matter what, Verna is your mother.
 Don't you want to have a relationship with your mother? This isn't a relationship.
 This is some woman who shows up every couple of years to ask for money.
 To her, I'm just a gorgeous, naturally blonde A.
T.
M.
 You know, my mother and I sometimes didn't see eye-to-eye.
 But at the end of the day, we always said # Don't go to sleep with a frown in your pocket # Ugh, Liz, you don't know anything about mothers.
 Where's Jack? # Go into your yard and tie it on a rocket # # Shoot it to the moon, you'll be feeling better soon # # Don't go to bed with a frown # Yeah, there were firemen there and everything.
 Where? At my house.
 I left my Sith Lord cloak too near my mom's shrine to Italian Jesus, and the candles started a fire.
 Were the firemen strong? Were any of them the ones from the calendar? My mom's staying with family upstate, but I've got to find someplace around here to crash.
 I'm sorry.
 Would you like to stay in my guest house? Yeah, thanks.
 When's good to go over there? Oh, I'm not offering.
 I'm just taking a survey to gauge general interest.
 But Liz there has a spare apartment.
 Ain't that right, Liz? Well, it's not really spare.
 I bought the place upstairs from me when I thought I was getting a talk show.
 But I'm going to finish the combination as soon as I either hit the lottery or get married.
 Ugh.
 Fine, you can stay with me.
 But it's stuff like this that makes me eat things like this.
 Thanks, Liz.
 Oh, I'd like to pre-apologize for clogging your tub, sink and toilet.
 Ugh.
 Mothers You can't kill them.
 Verna's been using me my whole life, Jack.
 I never saw a penny from any of the commercials I booked.
 Keep you and your pets safe with Gator Hater Gator Spray.
 Honey, you've got to get closer to the gator.
 We drove 11 hours to get here, and you're not getting any younger.
 But when I wanted to sing a duet in a mother-daughter pageant, she blew it off because there was no prize money.
 But today is different, Jenna.
 Today, you break the cycle.
 Because today, you are going to say, "No".
 I developed this presentation in 2002 when Colleen attempted to lengthen her Christmas visit to Martin Luther King Day, or, as she calls it, "That Day in January When the Post Office is Closed".
 I had to draw the line.
 I had to say This word is your best friend.
 Best friend with benefits? Step one, say no.
 Step two she will try to pick a fight with you.
 You will not let her.
 She will raise her voice.
 But I'm going to ask you to always speak quieter.
 Can I just tell you I'm genuinely having fun right now? If you raise your voice, emotions take over and she gets the upper hand.
 But if you're calm and quiet, you stay in control and it's on to step three.
 And this is the hardest one of all.
 She will tell you how disappointed she is in you, and she will get up to leave.
 And you let her walk away.
 It's simple.
 Say no, talk low, let her go.
 Frank! Frank? Do you smell smoke? What the hell, Frank? Look, Liz.
 How can you smoke? It's disgusting.
 And in my apartment? Wow, an old, white lady yelling at me while wearing microwaveable socks.
 This is so different than living with my mom.
 Okay, so I smoke a little as a stress release.
 I never told you because I knew you'd lecture me.
 It is not a lecture to simply point out to someone that the episode of Diff'rent Strokes about Dudley's dad has proven incontrovertibly that smoking destroys your health and leads to ridicule from Willis.
 Well, what about you? You can't judge me when you're eating that garbage.
 That is not the same thing at all, Frank.
 Doctor Oz did a show about junk food.
 I saw it because it's on a compilation DVD I have of fat ladies crying.
 And this stuff will kill you.
 "Manufactured in a facility that also processes food.
" This is what Meat Cat spoke of.
 So I guess I'll just get one of those little throat radios and you'll be buried in a piano crate.
 Good night, Liz.
 No, Frank, that fire in your apartment was no accident.
 I know, I just wanted to be in control.
 It was fate! We've been brought together to help each other stop being gross! What? What do you say? All right.
 But if doing this restores my sex drive, the plus-sized ladies in the mail room have you to blame.
 Oh, there's my baby girl! Hello, Verna.
 No, low, go.
 Okay, I know every time we see each other, I'm always hitting you up for money.
 And I know that it's always for something stupid, like paying the medical bills, with that time that my boyfriend broke his tailbone off in that cage match.
 But this time, it's different.
 I said no.
 Wait, what is this? I'm trying to pay you back! I'm trying to make good for once.
 Is this the fight? I'm talking quieter.
 I'm in control.
 What's that now? I'm the calm one.
 Upper hand.
 Jenna, why are we talking like this? Does somebody have a gun? I'm going lower now.
 Okay.
 Well, I know you're busy.
 I just wanted to say this face to face.
 I am so proud of you.
 And I love you so much.
 And I wish I had said that more.
 Don't go, Mommy.
 I'll stand closer to the gator.
 Goon! Sorry I'm late, Mr.
 Hornberger.
 Funny story.
 There was a guy on the subway who I thought for a second didn't have any fingers.
 But then I realized, he was holding his hand like this.
 Listen up, everyone.
 Frank and I have some exciting news to share.
 I am quitting smoking.
 And I am going to start eating healthier.
 I signed up for a service called NooFud that delivers humanely portioned organic meals.
 And I took the elevator all the way up here without losing my breath.
 Liz, God knows you should eat better.
 But maybe now is not the time.
 It's show week, and I can't have you melting down.
 And junk food is your stress release.
 We all need a release.
 I know.
 Because Kenneth has taken mine away from me, and I'm worried about what I'm going to do to replace it.
 While you were talking, I put a thumbtack in my neck.
 It makes me feel something.
 Well, don't worry about me, Pete.
 I have a new outlet.
 My delicious NooFud.
 Like my upcoming lunch: "Autumn tempeh risotto with salmon-rubbed streusel chunks".
 Oh! Jenna? I just wanted to see how it went with Verna last night.
 Jack, it was perfect.
 Like a John Mayer song.
 Good.
 So you said no? I didn't have to, she didn't want anything.
 She's completely changed.
 What? No, people do not change.
 In the late 90s, I thought Colleen had become a better person.
 It turns out she had a tumor pressing on her brain's pleasure center.
 A tumor those quack doctors removed.
 Jack, this is different.
 She gave me money.
 It's not different, Jenna.
 It never is.
 You must be Verna.
 Oh, and you must be Jack Donaghy.
 Jenna, you were right, darling.
 He does look like he'd be great between those two things we were talking about.
 Interesting earrings.
 Oh, thank you.
 I make them myself.
 Something's killing all the birds in my neighborhood.
 Mom, I really wish you didn't have to leave tonight.
 'Cause my birthday is this weekend.
 Oh, my God.
 I am the worst mother.
 No! Yes, I am.
 Don't say that.
 Could a bad mom have raised a daughter who was engaged to a congressman when she was 16? Jenna to the stage, please.
 Oh, that's me.
 Oh, good! Oh.
 Blowing town tonight, huh? I knew it was her birthday.
 I'm throwing her a surprise party.
 And it's at a fancy restaurant.
 So wear something nice.
 Like a pair of white jeans and a Dan Marino jersey or something.
 Hey, so how are you holding up? Terrible, I have a headache, a stomach ache.
 Last night, I spent an hour trying to remember how to spell the word "heighth".
 Liz, your body is crying out for all the chemicals it's used to.
 You can't go on like this.
 Here, eat it.
 Eat it, come on, you need your crutch.
 Stop it! God, your arms are really weak.
 What are you smiling at? Aren't you miserable? I have a very strong will.
 Rossitanos have refused to fight in seven wars.
 I don't buy it.
 There is no way that guy is stronger than me.
 Or me.
 He's got to be sneaking cigarettes.
 You're the one living with him, catch him in the act.
 Yeah, I still have his old cigarette pack.
 I will leave it out tonight as a trap and set up a video camera.
 Good idea, nanny cam.
 Just like the one our nanny used to catch me watching her sleep.
 High five.
 Ow! Hi, I was told I'd get paid if I came here and danced while the Atlanta Hawks eat dinner? Surprise! Oh, my God! Mom, you remembered! Well, of course I remembered! Come here, sweetie.
 I've seen this before.
 Classic Colleen move.
 Whatever it is Verna wants, she's going to ask for it tonight.
 And Jenna can't say no in front of all these people.
 My mother once won a radio contest to announce the starting lineups at a Red Sox game and used the opportunity to get me to promise never to put her in a home.
 What could I do? Carl Yastrzemski was looking right at me.
 This isn't about you.
 So you need to get over your issues and try to be happy for Jenna.
 Speaking of issues, I had a dream the other night that we were married and I gave birth to a cartoon cat.
 So Could I have everybody's attention, please? Thank you.
 In my life, I've been a lot of things: A liar.
 A dental hygienist.
 But I haven't always been a good mom.
 Jenna, honey, I don't know if you remember, but when you were 11, we were supposed to sing together at a mother-daughter talent pageant.
 I had completely forgotten about that.
 What betrayal? Well, I was drinking pretty heavily then on account of my bad knee.
 And then, I went and drove my jet-ski into that great, big bunch of moths.
 So I did not make it to that pageant.
 Honey, I don't deserve a single thing from you.
 But I've got to ask one favor.
 And it's a big one.
 If you would do me the very great honor of joining me.
 Hit it! # Do that to me one more time # # Once is never enough # # With a daughter like you # # Do that to me one more time # # I can never get enough # # Of a mom like you # # Oh # # Kiss me # # Like you just did # How are you not moved by this? Well, because I'm listening to the words.
 # Do that to me once again # Verna? Hey! Nice office, Jack.
 I fell like I'm in the Martha Stewart section of a Kmart.
 What can I do for you? Oh, well, I just wanted to thank you for coming to the party.
 It meant a lot to Jenna.
 And it was pretty important to me too.
 See, now you know what the show would be like.
 What show? Jack I did not drive my home all the way to New York City just to kiss my daughter's ass.
 Thank you.
 I want to do a T.
V.
 Show about me and her.
 You want to do a reality show? Come on.
 You see how good I am at pushing Jenna's buttons.
 Yeah, this show will have laughter, tears, topless arguments, infections caused by jacuzzi water.
 I knew it.
 I knew you had something up your sleeve besides, a tattoo with let me guess.
 It's a mermaid doing it with Captain Morgan.
 Now, come on, Jack.
 We both understand the value of a dollar.
 Boop.
 Now won't you please do me this favor? Talk to Jenna.
 There's a lot more where that came from which is in my under-panties.
 Come in! Jenna, I was right.
 I was right all along.
 What's that? Ah, new earrings.
 My mom just made them, so they still might have some pigeon mites.
 But she said those can't "affect-affect humans-humans".
 Yes, well, it certainly is amazing to see how your mother has made this 180.
 It's even better, Jack.
 She's made a full 360.
 Well, I just wanted to come by and make sure you're okay.
 I'm glad to see you're so happy.
 I am happy.
 Because now, I have everything.
 Good morning, dummies.
 So Frank can go cold turkey, but I can't? Well, well, well, well.
 Frank's old cigarettes.
 When I went to bed last night, there were 15 cigarettes in the pack This morning, there were 12.
 What? J'accuse! Look, I don't know where those cigarettes went.
 If only some genius had secretly videotaped her living room last night.
 Oh, wait, it did.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
 Hang on, you videotaped your living room? All night? Sure did.
 And as soon as I figure out which one of these things is the thingy Coming at you.
 Give me.
 You didn't believe in me.
 But I believed in myself.
 Just like the last scene of all movies.
 Okay.
 Here we go.
 What are you wearing? They're called night spanks.
 Well, I don't even remember getting up.
 What am I doing? You're sleepwalking, Liz.
 It's a little-understood parasomnial disorder.
 She's not sleepwalking.
 Oh, my God.
 I'm sleep-eating.
 You tried to take away your release, Liz.
 But nature finds a way.
 Did you learn nothing from Jurassic Park? Why am I making a phone call? Okay, I don't mean to be the black guy at the movies, but you better move, girl! Uh-oh.
 Oh, Liz, you didn't.
 I ordered a pizza.
 Oh! Oh, I don't want to see this.
 Okay, fine, I cheated in my sleep.
 But Frank folded too.
 Because I am not making it up about the cigarettes.
 Wait, what are you doing now? No, no, please, no.
 Oh, God, Liz.
 You didn't smoke the I'm eating it! Okay, well, mystery solved.
 Liz ate the cigarettes.
 And I guess some of us just don't need a release.
 So let's turn the T.
V.
 Off.
 Hang on.
 Oh, thanks, Frank.
 Oh, there's more.
 Denise, I said wait upstairs.
 My boss is asleep in the other room.
 I was told you had a package for the mail room.
 Oh, come on! This just got awesome.
 I need you, Denise.
 I'm trying to quit smoking, and my mom's not here.
 I'm your mama now, baby.
 # Don't go to sleep with a frown in your pocket # # Go into your yard and tie it on a rocket # This is the worst thing I've ever seen.
 # You'll be feeling better soon # # Don't go to bed with a frown # I love you, Denise Mommy.
 We all need our release.
 Verna? I want to be in business with you.
 We are going to be swimming in green, Jack.
 Just like when I dye my pool on St.
 Patrick's Day.
 I do have a couple of notes.
 This project will not be about drama or dysfunction.
 People are tired of that.
 Well, so, what's it about? Redemption.
 It's about a mother making amends to her daughter.
 And it's not a show, it's four visits per year: Christmas, Mother's Day, Jenna's birthday and Thanksgiving.
 You treat Jenna with the respect she deserves, you get a check.
 You're trying to bribe me into being a good mom.
 Well, it is all just about money.
 Isn't it, Verna? Well, maybe for me.
 But this is emotional for you, isn't it? And I believe that gives me the upper hand.
 And you're going to have to pay.
 Big.
 Three grand a visit And a rain tarp for my washer and dryer.
 Deal.
 Verna, stop stroking my palm with your middle finger.
 This is a business transaction.
 Oh, sorry.
 Ooh, Mr.
 Big Shot.
 Dudley's father went outside and lit a cigarette.
 In the next episode Good morning, Pete.
 Kenneth Liz.
 If you are spending your mornings with Kenneth, what's your release? Uh Oh, I feel alive! I've been biting my nails.
 Oh.
 Hey, Liz.
 Verna's coming back for Mother's Day.
 We're going to do a duet of "I'll Make Love To You" at a children's hospital.
 That's great, Jenna.
 Hey, Jack, guess what? Verna's coming back for Mother's Day.
 She is? What a surprise.
 So I guess you were 100 percent wrong about everything.
 Think about that, Jack.
 You're a good man, Jack Donaghy.
 Thanks, Meat Cat.
 Oh, I've got an idea for a show called Doctor, about Richard Doctor, who's a piano player.
 Do you remember that show, Jennifer Slept Here? Ann Jillian plays the ghost of a Hollywood starlet who helps teenagers.
 With what? I don't know.
 Some of those people on Match Game were drunk.
 With power.
 Did you know the Today Show used to have a monkey on it? Hasn't been as good since.
 I think that chimp used to drive the truck himself on You Know What and The Bear.
   

                




                    			Hey, Liz.
 My daughter is selling Valentine cookies for a school fundraiser.
 Valentine's Day is a sham created by card companies to reinforce and exploit gender stereotypes.
 Evelyn, this is the lady I was telling you about.
 I like Valentine's Day.
 Tommy Reticker gave me a card.
 Learn from my sexual misadventures, Evelyn.
 Last Valentine's Day, I watched my boyfriend, Drew's, mother/grandmother die.
 I met Floyd on Valentine's Day, but he left me for the city of Cleveland.
 And forget about Dennis.
 That pervert would always just try to get me drunk.
 All right, so zero cookies.
 No, I'll buy some cookies.
 But not for Valentine's Day.
 Instead, these cookies celebrate the February 14th birthday of Anna Howard Shaw, famed American suffragette.
 Happy Anna Howard Shaw Day to you, Evelyn.
 Come on.
 A Happy Anna Howard Shaw Day to us all! Lemon, which one of these ties do you find more attractive? The red, definitely.
 Thank you.
 I've got to look camera ready tonight.
 I'm being interviewed on C.
N.
B.
C.
 Have you ever watched The Hot Box with Avery Jessup? No, C.
N.
B.
C.
 Gives me a headache.
 I get all my money advice from P.
B.
S.
 Where should I put my money? In tech stocks? Or the housing market? Tech stocks, Foxy Moneybags! Tech stocks! Sir, your reservations are all set for Valentine's Day.
 And just to be clear, are you and I exchanging No.
 Why do you have Valentine's plans? What about Nancy? Nancy knows that I'm here when she's ready.
 But after what we went through her marriage, the way that it ended between us it was, uh very intense.
 Like when you think there's one more stair, but there isn't.
 And all of a sudden, you're like "Whoa!" Exactly.
 So for now, I just want something fun and easy.
 Frankly, I could use a win.
 A win? What's with the euphemisms, Jack? Why don't you just say you want some Is that sex, Lemon? It's the way I do it.
 So who's the lucky lady? Uh, I'm not sure yet.
 I have three dates set up across the city, and I hope one of them works out.
 How are you going to handle three different dates? Well, I have a system for first dates.
 At an appointed time, Jonathan calls me and tells me that I have a conference call with the Geneva office.
 If I don't like the woman, I have an excuse to leave.
 If I do like her, I loudly tell Jonathan that I'm doing something more important.
 The woman is suitably impressed, and I am guaranteed to see some underwear.
 Perhaps a, uh, bra with a front clasp.
 What? What are your plans for Valentine's Day, Lemon? I am taking myself out of the equation entirely.
 I scheduled a root canal for February 14th, Jack.
 I will spend half the day in twilight sleep.
 Then I will go home and watch the Lifetime original movie, My Stepson is My Cyber-Husband.
 Wow, that is inspired.
 You are truly the Picasso of loneliness.
 Or I am that painting elephant of being awesome.
 Kenneth Have any packages come for me today? No, Miss Maroney.
 Well, that doesn't make any sense.
 Valentine's Day is always a huge deal for Maynard Roger Hoynes.
 That's my stalker.
 You have a stalker? It's a real problem in the celebrity community.
 But if Beyonce simply answered one of my letters, I'd stop trying to break into her house.
 So if you haven't heard from him, isn't that a good thing? Kenneth, the celebrity-stalker relationship is very special.
 Maynard's debilitating devotion validates how wonderful I am.
 But what does it say about me if he's moved on? Maybe to one of my peers, like Julia Roberts.
 I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation, Miss Maroney.
 Hey.
 Has anybody heard about any cool, new sex positions? My girlfriend's visiting for Valentine's and I want to keep things caliente.
 Oh, my God, Lutz.
 Are you still pretending Karen exists? She's real.
 Would a fake woman have a personal website at JDLutz.
 Com/karen/proof? Oh, good grief.
 My cousin set me up on a blind date for Valentine's, and I just found out the girl is well, urban.
 Are you saying she's black? I don't know how to get out of this.
 Dude, come out with me.
 You know that load with the messed-up teeth who cleans the urinals? She'll only go out with me if she can bring her ugly sister.
 Wow, I can't believe you guys are letting Valentine's Day win.
 Not me.
 One word.
 Oral.
 Two words.
 Oral surgery.
 I'm having oral surgery and skipping Valentine's Day.
 Doctor's orders.
 Oh, that reminds me.
 Uh, Doctor Kaplan's office called.
 The want to know who's picking you up after your procedure.
 What? Yeah, it's an insurance thing.
 Anytime you have anesthesia, someone needs to bring you home.
 Hey, that stuff messes you up.
 When I had my wisdom teeth out, I tried to get in the bath with my mon.
 Okay, is there any chance that you could take me home? Sorry, every year, Paula and I rent this big suite up at Niagara.
 Then she takes the kids there and I stay home and get wasted in my garage.
 It's what keeps the magic alive.
 Welcome back.
 I'm here with Sheinhardt Universal Vice President Jack Donaghy.
 Thanks for sitting in "The Hot Box", Jack.
 My pleasure, Avery.
 Also joining me, Walter Stein, whose bow tie tells us he works for some liberal think tank.
 And the food in his beard tells us that he purchased a snack pack on the train from New Haven.
 Ooh, that's got to hurt, Walter.
 Let's get to "The Countdown".
 First topic.
 Prime Minister Wynn wants a week one.
 Do we? China needs to transition to a spending economy.
 After Dubai, what's the next credit crisis? The Baltics or women's tennis.
 Do we need a second bailout? Absolutely not.
 I love it, try to get in there, "Beta Dog".
 I am trying.
 Who will be the next President of these United States? Three.
 Mitt Romney's oldest son, Jezba.
 Dennis Kucinich.
 Okay, that's sad, Walter.
 Just sad.
 Jack, back to you.
 Who's number one on your speed dial? Blackberry, Warren Buffett.
 IPhone, Jimmy Buffett.
 Favorite movie.
 Tie, The Fountainhead or Uncle Buck.
 My wife and I just saw The Yellow Handkerchief.
 Just sit a couple out, Stein, god.
 All, right, karaoke go-to? Jack, hit me.
 Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.
 Oh, I rock the brothers Halen.
 Let's grab a drink after this.
 You read my mind.
 We'll be right back after this ad aimed at the elderly.
 Excuse me one second.
 Hey, Tray.
 I really need a ride home from the doctor's on Valentine's Day.
 Can't do it, "Lee-Lem".
 On Valentine's Day, Angie and I rent a room with a heart-shaped hot tub and cook chili in it.
 Then we take it to a soup kitchen And that's where it starts to get sexy.
 Hey, Jenna.
 Please tell me you haven't already concocted your usual Valentine's Day drama.
 Can't talk, Liz.
 I just got my stalker's work address from his parole officer, and I'm going to confront him about why he's ignoring me.
 Hey, Kenneth.
 Are you free on Valentine's? No, Miss Lemon.
 I'm sorry.
 I will be attending an all-day abstinence rally.
 You're welcome to come.
 I think I've got an extra gender-neutralizing hood.
 No, thanks.
 Hey, Liz! Hey.
 The answer's no.
 Hello, Maynard.
 Jenna.
 You shouldn't have come here.
 Well, what was I supposed to do? It's almost Valentine's Day and I haven't heard anything from you.
 Has the dog who gives you your orders died? No, Brandon's fine.
 Jenna, we need to talk.
 I don't think I can stalk you anymore.
 No, you don't mean that.
 Look, I have a new therapist.
 I'm taking my meds.
 I can't even see electricity shooting out of your head anymore.
 Well, is there someone else? It's one of those kids from Glee, isn't it? Jenna, please don't make a scene.
 I always knew this would end someday.
 I just thought it would be with me in the trunk of a rental car.
 So, uh, where did you go to school? Choate, then Yale, then two years in Africa with the Peace Corp.
 The Peace Corps, that's surprising.
 Oh, no, The Peace Corp.
 Lawrence Peace's corporation.
 We drilled for oil in gorilla habitats.
 Of course.
 You know, I learned to talk to gorillas when I worked for G.
E.
 Medical.
 We are going to test poisons on you.
 Oh.
 So, uh, are you seeing anyone? Not for a few months.
 You remind me of him, actually.
 I have a thing for commanding salt-and-pepper types.
 I don't know why.
 I think it started when I walked in on my parents doing it the day Reagan was shot.
 I wouldn't over-analyze that.
 Mm.
 Hello.
 I am calling about the made-up conference call with Geneva.
 I love having secrets with you.
 One time, I ran over an old lady in Arizona and just kept driving.
 Yes, damn it, Geneva.
 Well, cancel the conference call.
 I'm doing something far more important now.
 And, uh, more beautiful.
 You're kidding, right? I mean, that's your move? I beg your pardon? It' 3:30 in the morning in Geneva, Jack.
 Who's your call with? The hooker working the corner outside Raiffeisenbank? Whoa, well, it is February.
 And in Switzerland, that is, uh, "Night Business Month".
 Yeah, okay.
 All right, I'm sorry.
 I forgot who I was dealing with.
 Stay and just have another drink.
 Look at me, Jack.
 Look how my body goes with this dress.
 I don't need to be dealing with amateurs.
 Listen, Frank.
 I really need a ride home from the doctor on Valentine's Day.
 Are you free? No, that cleaning lady finally agreed to go out with me.
 We're going to pick up some pierogies and then, eat them at her husband's grave.
 You thought you were so much smarter than us, didn't you? But now, you're in the exact same crappy Valentine's Day boat everyone else is in.
 No, I'm not.
 I just need a ride home, not a date.
 They're completely different situations.
 How's that? All we want on Valentine's Day is to know that someone cares even a little about us.
 Aren't you looking for the same thing? In fact, yours is worse.
 If you don't get that tooth fixed, the infection will probably move to your brain and kill you.
 Yeah, well, if I die, my ghost is going to haunt you.
 Then your ghost is going to see some disgusting stuff.
 Lemon, look at this.
 It's from Avery Jessup.
 Oh, It's set to the wrong time.
 It's set to Geneva time.
 Last night, Avery saw right through my conference call move.
 Today, she sent this.
 "Hopefully, you won't make the same mistake again, 'mon se poivre That means "my salt and pepper" in Swiss French.
 She's hitting the ball back, Lemon.
 Game on.
 Wow, Avery Jessup, she's hot.
 She was on Maxim's "I'd Rape That 100.
" I know.
 And besides being beautiful, Avery is smart and doesn't suffer fools.
 And when I eventually seduce her, it's going to be very satisfying.
 Well, great.
 I hope you enjoy your weird game of sexy oneupsmanship.
 Meanwhile, the male escort that I hired to take me home from surgery has had a chlamydia flare-up, so Uh, Lemon, I wish I could help you but I have to concentrate on Avery.
 Uh, I need a big next move, and you have a show tonight.
 I've invited her to be my guest at the T.
G.
 S.
 V.
I.
 P room.
 We don't have a V.
I.
P.
 Room.
 Or V.
I.
P.
s.
 Get Jon Bon Jovi.
 He's N.
B.
C.
's current Artist-In-Residence.
 What is that? A not-stupid program that I came up with.
 Bon Jovi is under contract with us for a full year and scheduled to appear across a variety of programming platforms.
 Okay, fine, I'll set it up.
 Thank you.
 Because tonight, she's going to get the Jack Donaghy "A" game.
 Ooh, she's getting the Jack Donaghy "A" game.
 I hope she can keep her clothes on.
 Lemon, your hair looks very nice today.
 You should wear it like that more often.
 Oh, my.
 Well, I never, uh Ma'am, is something wrong? Maynard left me.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 Look at this.
 It's the first letter he ever sent me.
 "Jenna, I was in your bedroom last night.
 "I left a gift in your toilet.
 "You will be my bride someday.
" Oh, how can you be upset about losing a guy like this, Miss Maroney? Look, I know it's crazy.
 Maynard is a weirdo.
 But that weirdo loved me unconditionally.
 You know what I realized? He's the longest relationship I've ever had.
 Except, of course, for Doug.
 Please do not say what Doug is.
 Doug is my vibrator.
 This is the worst Valentine's Day ever.
 Hello, this is Elizabeth Lemon.
 I have surgery scheduled tomorrow, and I am not embarrassed to tell you that I don't have anyone to pick me up.
 And I will be leaving alone.
 Ma'am, you really need someone.
 No, I don't.
 I don't need anyone.
 Because I can do every single thing that a person in a relationship can.
 Everything.
 Even zip up my own dress.
 You know, there are some things that are actually harder to do with two people.
 Such as monologues.
 Look, if you really don't have anyone you can sign a liability release.
 Then, you can leave alone.
 I'll fax it to your office.
 Great, thank you for looking out for a sister.
 In a feminist way.
 Not because you're black.
 Although it doesn't matter, because I'm black too.
 Nope, you're going to meet me.
 No, I'm not black.
 Thank you for setting all this up, Lemon.
 Grizz, Dotcom, thank you for pretending to be bouncers.
 Maybe someday, we'll live in a world where you ask us to pretend to be scientists.
 Jon.
 Thank you for coming.
 Oh, no problem, Jack.
 What do you need? Arena rock anthem, power ballad? Actually, I have a date, uh, coming by.
 So if you can come over at some point and say hello, that would really impress her.
 Oh, sure.
 That sounds like an appropriate use of my time and talent.
 Liz, the doctor's office faxed this to you earlier.
 Hey, when are you going to set up that cool V.
I.
P.
 Lounge? Thank you, Cerie.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 You shouldn't sign anything without reading it first.
 I made that mistake once, and I ended up N.
B.
C.
's Artist-in-Residence.
 Oh, okay.
 Give me it.
 I have an honorary degree from Monmouth University.
 Hm.
 "I, the undersigned, henceforth known as 'The Alone' "hereby state that on February 14th, "I have absolutely no one in my life.
" You're alone on Valentine's Day? Well, it's not about a date.
 I just don't have a ride home from the doctor's office.
 But isn't that the same thing? I mean, isn't it about having somebody out there? Yeah, I get it, Bon Jovi.
 It's already been explained to me.
 "I, 'The Alone', otherwise known as 'Jane Sadwoman' "release Dr.
 Kaplan's office of all legal responsibilities.
 "Will likely die alone, eaten by house cats.
" Boy, this seems like a lot of unnecessary Forget it, I am not signing this.
 I reject the idea that there is some stigma to being alone.
 All right, then what's the plan if you don't sign the release? I just tell them that my boyfriend is going to pick me up.
 And then, after the surgery, I'll make a run for it.
 So you're going to invent a boyfriend on Valentine's Day? That is the lamest thing I've heard since this.
 I'm Tyke Myson, baby boxer.
 I wrote that.
 Hey, Jack.
 Who's this lovely? Uh, excuse me, Bon Jovi.
 I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
 Yeah, but you said to Uh Thank you.
 I hate it here.
 Wow, that was a lot better than your little conference call move.
 Can I get you a drink, Avery? Or we could just get out of here.
 Yes, we could.
 Hello, Elizabeth Lemon.
 Do you have your release? No, I don't need it.
 Because my boyfriend, Astronaut Mike Dexter, will be picking me up.
 On his motorcycle.
 Mm-hm.
 Take a seat.
 # I will remember you # # Will you remember me # # Don't let your love # # Pass you by # # Weep not for # # the memories # # Remember the good times # # that we had # # I let them slip away from us # # When times got bad # Maynard? # I will remember you # You know, I don't think the "anastacia" actually "affectored" me.
 Oh, my God.
 What are you doing here? We knew you'd need a ride home.
 What do you mean, "we"? You can't leave without a ride, dummy.
 Happy Valentine's Day.
 Oh, you have some dried blood on your teeth.
 You're here.
 You're all here because you didn't want me to be alone today.
 Oh, Floyd.
 I still think every day about what would have happened if I had gone to Cleveland with you.
 And even you, Dennis.
 Watching The Color Purple drunk with you was one of the funnest nights of my life.
 Drew.
 So handsome.
 So, so stupid.
 Seeing all of your beautiful faces and Dennis' jean jacket, I know that I don't need anyone, but I do want to be loved.
 We all do.
 And if it didn't work out between us, it's just because I'm not finished becoming me yet.
 But I will find love someday.
 Because I am a sailor on the sea of the human heart.
 Okay, this bitch is tripping her ass off.
 Well, what do we do with her? I got a date tonight.
 I say we order her some pizza.
 Yes! And lock her in here for the weekend.
 I'm going to start dialing numbers until somebody picks up.
 What's that, Bon Jovi? You love me too? Hey, do you want to grab breakfast? You're sweet, Jack.
 But let's not pretend this is anything more than it is.
 I'm sorry? Look, despite what happened in the shower last night, I'm a pretty traditional girl.
 I mean, I want a husband someday and a family.
 And men like you don't.
 Men like me? That isn't fair, I want a family.
 A son I can throw a ball to and, when he's older, have power struggles with.
 Jack, you don't have to lie to me, okay? I love guys like you.
 You're great.
 For one night.
 Look, Avery, I admit this isn't what I was looking for going into this weekend.
 But you're an amazing woman.
 Lemon, I can't Oh.
 You're kidding.
 Oh, okay.
 I'll be right there.
 I need to go.
 Jack, the phone trick again? I mean, I'd be insulted if I wasn't so impressed by your assistant.
 This isn't a trick.
 I have to pick up a hallucinating employee of mine from the oral surgeon's office.
 Well, that's at least creative.
 Look, cancel your walk of shame.
 Come with me on a car ride of proof.
 Oh, my God! Who did this? I don't know.
 I guess some weirdo out there loves you.
 Thank you, Kenneth.
 I don't know what your'e talking about.
 Happy Valentine's Day.
 What hotel is this? Uh, would you just keep an eye on her? I'm going to turn down her bed.
 I was sure he was making this up.
 Yes, you're a very pretty doggie.
 Hey, what do you think about Jack? Who, Jackie? He's the best one.
 I don't know what I would do without him.
 Yeah, he's pretty great, isn't he? Bon Jovi.
 Um No, no, no, no, no, no.
 Lemon, it's time for bed.
 It's time for bed.
 Shanice? What you going to do this weekend? Me going to re-wallpaper me powder room, man.
 Ooh, girl.
 You need a boyfriend.
 Why I need a man just to help me put up me wallpaper? I'm a independent woman.
 Okay, Miss Ting.
 You see how she try to act like she don't want one? Uh-huh.
 You know she going to come back in here crying when she can't kill a water bug.
 What you want to order for lunch today? Don Cheadle on a bed of rice.
 No, she didn't.
 She didn't.
 Happy Valentine's Day, no one.
   

                




                    			Lemon.
 When you were watching me after my oral surgery, did I put a toaster waffle into my D.
V.
D.
 Player? You did.
 You watched it for about an hour, said Nicole Kidman should get an Oscar for it, then you turned it off.
 Yikes.
 Thanks for babysitting me.
 I did my best, but you were pretty far gone.
 You kept trying to order home massages off of craigslist.
 Good thing you were here.
 Hey, somebody order a massage? Oh, brother.
 You're too late! I already killed her! Ah! Well played, Lemon.
 You went running? I thought you'd left.
 Who else is out there this early? Almost exclusively women that look like me.
 If the pervert community gets wind of morning jogging, God help us.
 Have you seen this? They keep talking about Sheinhardt selling N.
B.
C.
 To, uh, CableTown.
 That's never going to happen.
 How could a company from Philadelphia buy a company from New York? That would be like Vietnam defeating the United States in a ground war.
 I don't know, Jack.
 My sources Well, I'm telling you that Don Geiss and I spoke about this and that sale is dead.
 Look, I read his autobiography, Geiss Cubes, whatever that means.
 It means the book is filled with cubes of knowledge.
 It's a good title.
 The principles in this book are timeless.
 I can open to any page.
 "Because a woman's brain has fewer folds.
" Okay, hang on.
 Uh, "The Negroid musculature" Nobody's buying anybody.
 Hey, where is Frank? He still hasn't rewritten the Olympics sketch about Lindsay Vonn, who won the gold medal for skiing.
 Oh, Mister Rossitano called to say he overslept and I should make up an excuse for him.
 So here goes: On his way to work, he found some magic beans, and because he believed in them Ship up.
 Frank, Frank, Frank.
 What is this? "Future Husband"? Who did you put in your address book as "Future Husband"? I have absolutely no idea.
 Well, whenever I find something weird on my cell phone, I can usually trace it back to the last time I was drunk.
 Oh, my God.
 The dentist's office.
 Oh, your dentist gets drunk with you too? No, when I was under the anesthesia, I did a bunch of stuff I don't remember.
 Including meeting the man of your dreams? Oh, Miss Lemon, it's so romantic.
 Just like that movie I only saw the first 10 minutes of- Fatal Attraction.
 Liz, you have to call him.
 What? No.
 I was out of my mind on painkillers.
 I have zero memory of this guy.
 I don't know what he looks like.
 He could be a serial killer.
 He could wear a thumb ring.
 Miss Lemon, you're such a pessimist.
 You know what my motto is? "Everything always works out for the best.
" Watch this.
 I just threw my wallet out the window.
 But I'm not worried.
 Why? Because everything always works out for the best.
 Uh, I'm sorry.
 How was that supposed to make me call this guy? Be an optimist, Miss Lemon.
 Watch T.
G.
 S.
 This Friday on On I think we got it.
 Okay, good first take.
 Maybe we go one more time.
 Excuse me? Do you know who you're talking to? A future Tony-nominated actor.
 That's right.
 It is Tony eligibility season.
 And I'm going for the "T" in my "EGOT".
 Really? You've been cast on Broadway? I'm doing a one-man show.
 You are? When? Tonight.
 Have you prepared anything? What am I, a nerd? I'm going to keep it loose, Liz Lemon.
 Jonathan! Jonathan, why is it so quiet in here? Why aren't the phones ringing? Is it Senior Executive Skip Day? That's usually in the Spring so we can go to an amusement park.
 No, sir, I don't understand.
 Maybe we're the last people on earth.
 Maybe we are legend.
 You're Will Smith and I'm the dog.
 Hello? Answering your own phone on the first ring? It's all hands on deck over there, huh? Uh, what do you mean? Come on, the N.
B.
C.
 Buyout.
 What's happening today? I'm sorry.
 You're calling me as a source? How are you going to explain your "unnamed executive" to your producer? I'll tell him it's a guy I'm having sex with.
 It'sa 24-hour news cycle here, Jack.
 We really don't have time to do it right anymore.
 So what do you want to know? Okay.
 I know the deal is happening today.
 The board is having a secret meeting.
 I just need a confirmation.
 Wait.
 What? No.
 I already told you this morning.
 There's no deal.
 Oh, my God.
 You really don't know what's going on.
 They cut you out of the loop, Jack, because you're against it.
 No, I'm not out of the loop.
 I just can't talk about it.
 I'm actually finishing up a meeting right now.
 Rhubarb, rhubarb, golf.
 Prostate.
 I'm going to have to call you back.
 Jonathan.
 I want you to go down into your little assistant underworld and find out where everybody is.
 I don't care what it takes.
 This is a matter of life or death.
 Yes, sir.
 But if anything should happen to me, I want you to read, Oh, the Places You'll Go at my funeral.
 I'm not doing that.
 Rinse, please.
 Well, you're healing very nicely.
 You may continue to experience sensitivity for a few more days.
 When can I start eating hard cheeses again, doctor? I've had this pamphlet printed up.
 It was expensive, but I'm really tired of discussing this with you.
 Huh.
 Dr.
 Kaplan, the last time I was here, I think I made a gentleman friend.
 But because of the anesthesia, I can't remember where or how.
 Well, there was another patient in the recovery room with you.
 And I remember you were both laughing quite a bit.
 Okay.
 So, uh, who is he? What does he look like? He has some gum recession.
 Four-pockets on 14 and 15.
 But overall, very good teeth.
 Especially for an Englishman.
 Ooh, he's English? I've said too much.
 I really can't tell you anything about him.
 You know, doctor-patient confidentiality.
 Oh, come on.
 I mean, you're not really a doctor.
 Well, If that's how you feel, then you're not really a patient.
 And people who aren't patients don't get toys from the treat bucket.
 But there's a Batman in there! Yeah, and if you wind him up, he swims in the bath.
 Damn you, Kaplan! Who's here? I need someone to be outraged to.
 Oh, I'm here, Miss Maroney.
 I actually slept here because my house keys are in my wallet.
 It wasn't too bad.
 Late at night, these two, little, twin girls told me they wanted to play with me forever.
 Have you seen this? Is that a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade pun? In March? It's a rave review.
 For Tracy.
 It's as if "Claps-Giving Yay Harade" has lost all meaning.
 I did it! I'm a Broadway star! Jenna, could you accept my Tony on my behalf? June is a tough month for me because I begin life-guarding again.
 You know, renting a theater for one night and babbling onstage for an hour Five hours.
 Doesn't make you an actor.
 I don't know.
 People seemed to like it.
 Well, it certainly doesn't get you a Tony Award.
 I know the Tony rules because I've been petitioning for them to add a category for Living Theatrically in Normal Life.
 And I know for a fact you have to do your show a minimum of eight times to be eligible.
 Wait, the same show? Of course the same show.
 But I can't do that.
 I'm a spontaneous actor.
 I never do the same thing twice.
 Action! Honey, I'm home! Pac-Man, I'm Jewish! Jeffrey, we lost the tournament! I can't do seven more performances.
 Well, then, you better think of something else that starts with "T".
 For your little necklace.
 Do they give an award for Tarantula Misplacement? # Jonathan downloads Geiss' schedule # # Mr.
 Donaghy will be grateful # Oh, good morning, Miss Lemon.
 Still haven't found your wallet, huh? No, and I realized there was a prescription in there I should have filled yesterday.
 It keeps me from Hee-haw, hee-haw! Don't worry, it's just a donkey spell.
 Well, I went to the dentist yesterday, and I actually found out a little bit about my mystery guy.
 And? And I now know that he is English and he made me laugh.
 That's wonderful! Even if he does come from a country that's nothing more than the dried husk America came out of.
 So are you going to call him? And say what? That "You're my future husband"? I'd like to at least know what this guy looks like before I put myself out there.
 Then, we need to find a way for you to see him.
 Through trickery.
 Kenneth.
 We all know deceit is okay if it's done for love.
 Like when Lot's daughters got him drunk to repopulate the world through incest.
 Or when Screech went to the masquerade ball in disguise so Lisa would kiss him.
 This is Wesley.
 This is Nurse Jamakaiah from Dr.
 Kaplan's office.
 So here's da ting.
 You need to come in today so the doctor can check dem teeth, mon.
 Oh, is theresomething wrong? My check-up isn't for another week.
 He tinks dat toot might have some bad mojo in it, ja see.
 Might you be available to come in around 1:30, me lad? You're going Irish! Okay, 1:30's fine.
 Cool runnings, mon.
 Bobsled.
 See, Miss Lemon? I told you everything would Hee-haw, hee-haw! Stay away, I will bite you! Hee-haw! Jack, what brings you down to news? Hey, C.
N.
B.
C.
 Nightly News rules.
 Go break a story, Williams! Nightly rules! Avery, I have some information for you.
 But in exchange, I need you to do something for me.
 Okay.
 I told you last night, no.
 Why would you even want to braid my hair? Because it's romantic and I'm really good at it.
 But this is strictly professional.
 I saw Don Geiss' schedule.
 And you're right.
 There is something going on.
 And I know where.
 This is Jack Welch's address in Connecticut.
 But Don Geiss was seen last night at the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia.
 Decoys.
 Or he could have driven back by now.
 Ah, thanks for the tip.
 In return, here's how you're going to report it.
 "Geiss Fights Off Buyout, "Keeps Company Intact, Makes This Gesture".
 Jack, I can't do that.
 Because this deal is happening.
 And if Don Geiss is fighting it, You should start distancing yourself from him.
 Distancing myself? That man is my mentor.
 He taught me how to command a room with my voice.
 Back to work! All I'm saying is, the writing's on the wall.
 Do you think it was easy for me to cut ties from my old mentor, Pat O'Brien, after he shaved his moustache? So this is what you do to people? You use them, and then you throw them aside? That is not fair.
 This is not about us.
 This is about us.
 I came here asking you to help me.
 And I'm trying to help you.
 Being Don Geiss' guy just became a liability.
 I have spent 30 years trying to be that guy.
 But you're never going to be! Because no one is! That world doesn't exist anymore! You're making me sound just like my mother! Someone like you couldn't possibly understand.
 Jack.
 I'm going to Connecticut.
 I'm going to stand by my man.
 Which is the song that I sang to Don at his promotion dinner.
 Excuse me, Miss Maroney.
 Would you be interested in going to Mr.
 Jordan's show tonight? I know he could use your support.
 I don't think so.
 If I wanted to see a black guy make a fool of himself, I'd have sex with K-Fed again.
 I'm just worried Mr.
 Jordan may not EGOT.
 He has no idea what he did in his show last night.
 And without my wallet, I don't even have my lucky rabbit's spine.
 I don't know what's going to happen.
 I'll tell you what's going to happen.
 It's going to be a disaster.
 The man is not an actor and has no business being on stage.
 Why, with a curtain five hours from now, it would take the greatest acting coach the world has ever seen to make his show a success.
 Fine, I'll do it! Sign in, we're running behind today.
 We'll be with you as soon as we can.
 Bobsled.
 This is Wesley.
 Hello? # What # # Huh # # Right # # What # # Oh # Can you tell me why you come up on my phone as "Future Wife"? Would you like to get coffee? Mine was actually an infection in the right, rear molar caused by some loose bristles from an off-brand toothbrush that I had to buy over Christmas because my mom threw away my old Snoopy one.
 Wow, this is not interesting.
 I don't know what caused my root canal situation.
 Well, British people have notoriously bad teeth, so I've never heard that.
 Really? You've never heard people make jokes about British teeth? None of the Brits I know have a situation with their teeth.
 Well, it's just a thing people say.
 Like when they say older women have breadback.
 What's breadback? The loaf of back fat between a woman's bra and her giant underwear.
 No, that's not a thing.
 People don't say that.
 Not to you, no.
 I think we're getting off on the wrong foot here.
 It's turned into a bit of a situation.
 You use that word too much.
 So any siblings? Wow.
 God.
 Mr.
 Welch.
 It's good to see you again.
 Please, John, call me Jack.
 I actually go by Jack, as well.
 I don't think so.
 Well, I'd like to talk to Don.
 I know he's here.
 He is here.
 But he's dead.
 What? He died three weeks ago.
 The company wanted to keep it quiet until the deal went through.
 So I've been Hiding him in your freezer.
 Just like we did with Hiram Sheinhardt during the R.
C.
A.
 Deal.
 Look, I know how much Don meant to you.
 And if you need to pass some eye water, I'll be happy to go out and get you some weakness tissues.
 No, I'm not crying in front of Jack Welch.
 Neutron Jack.
 And I'm not giving up.
 Don Geiss wanted this company kept intact.
 And these people are from Philadelphia! Let it go, John! It's over.
 Miss Lemon! How did the dentist's office go? Did you meet Wesley? I did meet him.
 We even went out for coffee.
 And? And it was a disaster.
 We were so awkward that the waitress gave us separate checks without asking.
 And a priest came over and asked us who we'd lost.
 But it has to work out.
 Does it? Do you have your wallet back? Did I find my future husband? Sometimes, everything is just the worst, Kenneth.
 Jack? It's over, Lemon.
 It's all over.
 What? What's wrong? Don Geiss is dead.
 Oh, my God.
 They're selling N.
B.
C.
 To a company called KableTown.
 With a "K".
 Oh, yeah, my parents have KableTown down in Pennsylvania.
 It's a fine and generous company.
 My dream, the dream I've had since I was a child, is gone.
 I'll never be the C.
E.
O.
 Of The General.
 Oh, Jack, I'm so sorry.
 Will I still be able to turn in old cab receipts, or do you think I'm sorry.
 I don't know what to say.
 Maybe you should talk to Avery.
 I don't know about Avery anymore.
 She's probably distancing herself from me as we speak.
 I'm alone.
 I'm the protege' of a dead man.
 At a company that no longer exists.
 Wait.
 Did you hear that? That's the sound of me being erased from contact lists all around the world.
 Yeah, well, I hear something else.
 It's the Hug Plane coming in for a landing? You're cleared for approach.
 Acting is about consistency and control.
 Got it, no farting.
 I'm going to teach you the skills that will allow you to perform your show every night.
 Let us begin with elocution.
 Repeat after me.
 After me.
 No, Tracy.
 No, stop it, not this part.
 No, stop it.
 Up.
 We've got to start over.
 I farted.
 To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock, awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock.
 To sit in darkness in a sharp, shock shop in darkness in sitting in sharp.
 This is stupid.
 This is not stupid.
 These are the building blocks of the craft of acting.
 Something I have dedicated my life to, ever since my very first job as "Baby Stuck in Well" in a commercial for Well Guards.
 "Well Guards.
 Guard your well well.
" I remember that commercial.
 You were a fat baby.
 Well, maybe we're just going to have to agree to disagree on the acting process.
 You have no process! Acting is the discipline of being someone else at all times.
 I don't know.
 When I'm acting, I just do me.
 And people seem to love it.
 Then, I guess you don't need my help.
 Go out there and be yourself.
 Go on stage and read the damn phone book, for all I care! Kenneth What are you going to do, Mr.
 Jordan? Do you think you can repeat your performance? Your performance.
 Liz? Do you work here? Yeah, remember at coffee, you said you hadn't seen the show, but you'd heard bad things? Uh-huh.
 What are you doing here? I'm supposed to meet Kenneth Parcell.
 I found his wallet.
 What? You must be my wallet angel.
 No, this is not possible.
 But it is.
 I knew my wallet would turn up.
 And it did.
 No, Kenneth, this is Wesley.
 From the dentist's office.
 Oh, my goodness.
 This is the guy from the dentist's office.
 He found my wallet! Oh, I am either very happy right now, or I'm having a pretty bad donkey spell.
 I'm okay.
 It will pass.
 This is crazy.
 I guess we have to give it another shot.
 I guess we do.
 Dinner tonight? Perfect.
 Do you like Tex-Mex? No, I don't.
 See you there.
 The F.
C.
 C.
 Will now investigate this large-scale, multi-million dollar sale to Kabletown.
 And now, the$5.
6 billion question: Who will take the reins of the cable giant's new acquisition? According to my sources, the clear frontrunner current G.
E.
 Executive, Jack Donaghy.
 The people I'm talking to say he's the only guy out there with the programming experience, business savvy, and piercing, blue eyes of a Siberian husky that the job requires.
 I'm told Donaghy was instrumental in making this deal happen.
 And I spoke to him earlier.
 He refused to speculate, but did say, and I'm quoting here, "I'm going to celebrate by buying my lady friend "that necklace she pointed out and then, cooking her a Western omelette," end quote.
 And then, I'm going to braid your hair.
 Despite an afternoon rally, the market did finish quite lower.
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 19 points, and the NASDAQ down by 2.
 And the S&amp;P-500 Klarsfeld, Rubin M.
 Klarvet, Yuri.
 Klassen, Igor.
 Klastoren, Robert.
 Klatsko, Harold.
 Klauber, Tatyana.
 I'm his acting teacher.
 Bordinay, Lorenzo.
 Jenloe, Martin.
 Prodeman, Gil.
 Takahamo, Jessica.
 Themopolis, Dorothy.
 Lipowitz, Lauren.
 Bravo! It's a triumph!   

                




                    			I'd like to welcome everyone to this N.
B.
C.
 Employee Town Hall Meeting and thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules.
 Yeah, I'm supposed to be drinking a soda right now.
 A special thanks to those joining us via simulcast, particularly you gentlemen in the Tokyo office.
 I know it's late there.
 I don't know why you're wearing girls' pajamas, but I'm sure it's cultural.
 I'm here to address concerns regarding the acquisition of our company by KableTown, with a "K".
 This is an exciting time for N.
B.
C.
 Not Seinfeld, Friends, E.
 R.
 Exciting.
 More like 3D episodes of Merlin exciting.
 But I believe this is a great opportunity for all of us, because KableTown is a great company.
 Even if it is from Philadelphia.
 Go Eagles! How did you even get a snowball? Philly rules! Cheese steaks, Bobby Clarke, Will Smith! Your town sucks! You do not want this argument, Lemon.
 Boston is the greatest city in the world.
 Boo.
 Boston Tea Party, Boston cream pie, Boston Rob Mariano.
 Birthplace of Benjamin Franklin.
 Yeah, then he looked around, realized it sucked, and moved to Philadelphia! Oh, did you just whip a battery at me? Mr.
 Donaghy, I'm sorry.
 Can we get back to the meeting? Of course.
 My apologies to our friends from the great city of Los Angeles.
 Hey, stop laughing.
 L.
A.
 Rules.
 Michael Bay, freeways, Legoland Before I take your questions, I'd like to say a few words about Don Geiss.
 The world has lost a giant.
 He built G.
E.
 Into the greatest company on Earth and the Earth into one of the top three planets in the universe.
 For those of you wishing to pay your respects, there will be an Episcopal cryogenic freezing service open to all Six Sigma black belts and higher.
 That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
 Episcopal.
 Now, the floor is open to questions.
 I would be remiss if I didn't honor our fallen leader with a song.
 This is for you, "Dan Goose.
" # Amazing # # grace # So how was your second date with Wesley? Ah, well, you know that scene in Notting Hill where they have the romantic date in the garden? Well, I would have rather watched that terrible movie five times than have hung out with Wesley.
 So he's not your "Future Husband"? He's not my future anything.
 You gave it a shot.
 Good riddance.
 Nope, I'm seeing him tonight.
 You are? Why? Well, this morning I was buying an advance ticket for the Truffaut retrospective at the Anthology Film Archives.
 One for the 8:00 Hot Tub Time Machine? Liz? Are we both seeing Hot Tub Time Machine tonight? Why does this keep happening? If there is a God, Liz, I think that she Ugh.
 is trying to tell us something.
 It's like the universe keeps pushing us together.
 We can't shake each other.
 I had a thing where I kept running into Michael Douglas.
 But then I realized it was just some old lady who lives in my building.
 Lemon? A moment? We have a Tracy problem.
 Okay, escaped exotic animal or did he swallow another firecracker? I wish.
 Our old nanny wrote a tell-all book about me.
 Oh, no.
 It's bad, I just got the call from a friend at Little Brown.
 The publishing house? No, the premier talent agency for black dwarves.
 Tracy, we need to start doing damage control on this.
 What does she reveal in the book? My addiction to prescription glasses.
 The fact that I suffer from attention deficit disor Jack, your shoes are shiny.
 And worst of all, she revealed the fact that I've never cheated on my wife.
 Okay, well, that's not true.
 Uh, actually, it is true.
 Tracy, uh, shared that with me last year.
 What? What about the strip clubs and the disgusting stories? Your Ben and Jerry's flavor is called "Adulteraisin".
 That's all for show.
 I love my wife.
 And only her.
 Okay, and how is that a bad thing? My wild and sexually adventurous image is how I make my money, Liz Lemon.
 I start losing my endorsements, Angie's going to be madder than a bat in a suitcase.
 Uh-oh.
 Which reminds me.
 Gordon? Gordon.
 Whoa! I'm sorry.
 You have a problem with the science of Hot Tub Time Machine? Yeah, not the time travel.
 It's the hot tub.
 You don't just turn one on and it's immediately hot.
 I should know, I've been in a hot tub two times.
 Well, I don't question everything.
 Except for the snacks I got for us.
 Yeah, seltzer and Mike and Ikes.
 Well, what did you want? Popcorn? Yes! Popcorn? At the cinema? And by the way, your food obsession is not as endearing as you think it is.
 Huh.
 It's like being in a Cathy cartoon that just won't end.
 Oh, my God.
 I want to smash your face.
 I don't think we were meant to be together.
 So why are you in my phone as "Future Husband"? And why am I in yours as "Future Wife"? I guess we'll never know.
 At least we'll always have Dr.
 Kaplan's recovery room.
 It was our Paris.
 Too bad we can't go back there.
 Look at all these books, sir.
 I feel like I'm back at school, learning about the dangers of book reading.
 This is all research on KableTown.
 I'm trying to learn everything I can about our future owners.
 G.
E.
 Gave me the finest education known to man.
 I learned how to develop new products, innovate new technologies.
 We brought good things to life and bad things to Chinese rivers.
 G.
E.
 Is a great company.
 Second only to the company of great friends.
 I thought I would work at G.
E.
 Forever.
 But my future opportunities at the company died with Don Geiss.
 I have to accept that and move on to this exciting, new challenge.
 A friend of mine has been worried they'll be bringing in new page rules, like age limits and age verification.
 Truth be told, I haven't learned a lot about KableTown.
 It's a whole, different business model.
 My cousin in Atlanta is a business model.
 She holds up staplers in catalogs.
 But later today, I'm meeting with an old colleague who left G.
E.
 For KableTown five years ago.
 I'm going to pick his brain and learn how KableTown works so I can prove that I am the man with the ambition, the talent, and the looking-at-my watch skills to run this company.
 Terrific, sir.
 So, all we need you to do is to put us under anesthesia again.
 Wesley brought his video camera.
 In England, we call it a filmpod.
 No.
 And that way, afterwards, we can watch the tape and figure out what our connection was.
 Would you ask a cardiologist to do something like this? I am a real doctor.
 Yeah, but a cardiologist is I know what a cardiologist is.
 My brother is a cardiologist, and I'm just as good as he is.
 We drive the same car.
 So what if his wife is more attractive? But Dr.
 Kaplan, this is for love.
 It's like that brilliant film, uh, Notting Hill.
 I'm British and charming, and she's got certain angles that work for her.
 Really? You think you found "the one" in my recovery room? Let me show you what happens in there.
 We are going to hang out so much after this.
 I want to take you to the Big Apple Circus.
 'Cause we're best friends.
 I don't think there was any connection.
 It was just the anesthesia.
 Well, Liz, I wish you all the best.
 But "Future Wife" deleted.
 That's a good idea.
 And if my heart surgeon brother is so great, how come so many of his patients have died, But I've only killed one guy? Huh? Say it ain't so, Tray.
 What about the Seattle Seahawks cheerleader? That one kind-of-thick Rockette? That blind woman in the business class bathroom on the Acela.
 Were those all lies too? But Frank, I still party.
 I'm still terrible at my job.
 I looked up to you.
 Now I hate you.
 Tracy.
 I know what you're going through.
 I got a lot of flak after I ate the pig that played Babe.
 I learned you have to go on the offensive.
 Start denying this stuff.
 I did, J-Mo.
 I held a press conference this morning.
 I'm here to announce that I'm leaving show business to spend more time with my stripper.
 But it's like a black Barbie doll in Arizona.
 Nobody's buying it.
 Well, we lost another one, Tray.
 I just got off the phone with the people from Horny Goat Weed.
 They're dropping you as their spokesman.
 But John Edwards and I were supposed to ride on their Cinco de Mayo float! Yet another black superstar taken down by his personal life.
 Just like my favorite golfer.
 O.
J.
 Simpson.
 Remember how you tricked the owner of that toaster company into thinking you were his dead son? And they sold you the factory for one dollar.
 You are an animal, Dave "The Animal" Hess.
 I was only as good as my mentor, the man who taught me how to bait the enemy.
 Jack "The Master Baiter" Donaghy.
 So, Dave, tell me all about KableTown.
 What's their business strategy? Revenue streams? Do they have a preferred side of the head for parting your hair? Because I've been Continental for years, but I'm willing to go Western.
 Whoa, relax, buddy.
 Your job is secure.
 I just want to understand the operation, so I can contribute right away.
 Well, that's the beauty of it, Jack.
 You don't have to.
 The cable's already laid, so I don't understand.
 There's always room for growth, for innovation.
 No, there really isn't.
 It's brilliant.
 And this is the goose that lays the golden eggs.
 Channels 500 through 600.
 Oh, good God.
 Ass-atar? The Lovely Boners? The Hind Side? Fresh-Ass Based on the Novel 'Tush' by Assfire? It's all pay-per-view porn.
 But do you know how much of our profit comes from men ordering adult movies? They churn this stuff out, people at home push a button, and we make money off it.
 We don't do anything.
 Then what do you want with N.
B.
 C? Why do you even want me? Well, buying N.
B.
C.
 Counts as a charitable donation for tax purposes.
 And as for you, you're the classic American executive.
 You will look great standing behind our C.
E.
O.
 At press conferences.
 You are kidding me.
 I went to Harvard Business School.
 I'm the reason the microwave tray rotates.
 Jack.
 I make things, I build companies.
 Innovate products.
 Don't fight it, Jack.
 It's the perfect business.
 The war is over.
 And we won.
 "And Alexander wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.
" Hans Gruber, Die Hard.
 Hey.
 I know you're off duty, but is there any chance you would take me to the Upper West Side? Oh, gosh.
 Oh, thank you so much.
 Bloody hell.
 No, no, no, not again.
 Wait, that's not him, is it? Okay, that was almost Gangway for footcycle! Come on, I said, "Gangway for the" You witch! No, no, I am walking away.
 Wait, Liz, wait.
 Look, I wasn't even supposed to ride my footcycle home today.
 Stop calling it that.
 Yeah, fine, my velocipede.
 But I did ride it.
 Because the universe wanted me to run into you again.
 And I finally think I know why.
 Commencing eye-roll sequence.
 The universe wants us to settle for one another.
 Well, there has to be a reason this keeps happening to us, Liz.
 I think fate is telling us this is the best we're ever going to get.
 We're each other's settling soulmates.
 Settling soul mates? That is grim.
 And I've played Monopoly alone.
 Well, I know it's not ideal, but we'd both benefit.
 Then I could open jars and kill bugs for you, and you could make me look less gay at work functions.
 Look, I happen to believe in romantic Don't even say, "romantic love".
 How many couples do you know that are actually in love, that don't completely annoy one another? Okay, what about them? You wouldn't be complaining if you wore the shoes I bought you.
 You're an old bitch.
 Why fight this? Grow old with me, Liz? In separate bedrooms? No way.
 Have a nice life.
 Think about it, Liz! It's what the universe wants! You'd have someone to tell you when you're about to step in something.
 Oh, nerds.
 Okay, mentor time.
 I need a pep talk.
 Lemon, I'm not in the mood to solve your lady problems or listen to a story about whatever escapee from the Island of Misfit Toys you are currently dating.
 No, this is a Liz relationship emergency.
 It's a "Lizaster".
 Okay, Lemon, what is it? Okay, ever since I was little No, faster than that.
 My whole adult life No.
 Oprah says You have 10 seconds Okay.
 This guy, Wesley, thinks we should get married.
 Because it's time for us to settle.
 Now that's completely and totally wrong, because Is it? Maybe you should settle.
 Everybody settles.
 What? Look at me.
 At one point, my obituary was going to read, "C.
E.
O.
 Of G.
E.
 Dies Violently in Casino Orgy.
" Now what's it going to say? "Middle Manager of a Philadelphia Pornography Distributor Never Wakes Up? What are you talking about? KableTown.
 It's a mousetrap company.
 And you cannot build a better mousetrap.
 Wait, KableTown makes mousetraps? Kabletown doesn't make anything.
 Maybe it is the perfect business.
 A perpetual motion machine, endlessly satisfying every human need.
 Soon, you won't even have to leave your house.
 That sounds pretty good.
 They don't need ideas.
 They don't need innovation.
 In other words, they don't need me.
 Wait.
 Where are you going? I'm going to bury Don Geiss, America and hope.
 Hey, I saw some women came forward to say you didn't have sex with them.
 It's gotten worse.
 Somebody leaked my voicemails.
 Hey, baby, it's your husband.
 So I'm at Bed Bath and Beyond.
 And I can't remember.
 Did you say to get metal or wood shower curtain rings? Oh, you're calling me on the other line.
 I can't wait to talk to you.
 I love you.
 How does Angie feel about this? Is she mad? She says I better have an affair and quick, before it tears our family apart.
 I wish I could help you, but I can't sleep with a black guy.
 I'd lose my endorsement deal with NASCAR.
 That's the problem.
 Who's desperate enough to have sex with me at this point? Come on.
 You're still Tracy Jordan.
 There's got to be some skank around here who has made it very clear she wants you.
 Go save your career and give her the thrill of a lifetime.
 Hello, Elizabeth.
 May I offer you a succulent fruit? What? No.
 Why are you in here? Let me do a dance for you, my lover.
 No! No, this is wrong! I can't have sex with you, Liz Lemon! I love Angie too much! Wow, okay.
 That was not going to happen for many reasons besides you loving your wife.
 Reason one, I'm conscious.
 Reason two, you smell like Icy Hot.
 Reason three I'm sorry, L.
L.
, I know how much you wanted this to happen.
 I'm disappointed in me too.
 If I can't have an affair, Tracy Jordan is finished.
 Stop it.
 Just embrace the fact that you are lucky enough to be a happily married man.
 I mean, I'm actually jealous of you.
 You've got stability, a great marriage, devoted kids.
 You know what I have? A Sims family that keeps getting murdered.
 So quit whining and be grateful.
 I am lucky.
 Thanks, Liz Lemon.
 You're welcome, Tray.
 And you know what? One day, you will have what I have.
 Because you're an amazing, strong, intelligent woman.
 Like Hillary From Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
 Thank you.
 That's a very good pep talk.
 Oh, God! I'm sorry.
 I was still riding the vibe from earlier.
 Welcome all to the memorial service / freezing for Donald H.
 Geiss.
 You were the last of a dying breed, sir.
 I'll never forget the first thing he ever said to me.
 "These are all hookers.
 Pick one.
" Then after we picked our hookers and the plane took off, he told me his business philosophy.
 There's always an untapped market.
 Don was the one who realized there was a whole segment of consumers not buying light bulbs.
 The asleep.
 That realization led him to develop the nightlight and the marketing campaign aimed at making children afraid of the dark.
 "A monster under every bed.
" Don said that no business is ever done evolving.
 That there are always opportunities for innovation.
 That you can always You can always find new customers.
 I I'm sorry.
 But I've just had an amazing business idea.
 You'll have to excuse me.
 I know it's not my place yet to call a meeting of KableTown senior vice presidents, but I have something I need to share with you.
 Gentlemen, there is a giant segment of consumers who are not buying our most lucrative product.
 Three words.
 Porn for women.
 Jack, women hate porn.
 Almost as much as men hate going to outlet malls.
 Yes, women hate porn.
 Our porn.
 But women do have one insatiable need.
 To jabber.
 And it doesn't matter if you have a headache or you're not in the mood or you're about to go to Don Geiss' funeral.
 They barge right into your office and start complaining about a boyfriend or a co-worker.
 And you're supposed to sit there and nod and tell them they're right.
 And the more you give it to them, the more they want it.
 I tell you, sometimes my wife will be blathering on about something and I'll think, "I'm more than just "a pair of ears, you know.
 "I'm a person who thinks about sex every seven seconds.
" Exactly.
 So what if women had a pay-per-view channel featuring handsome men patiently listening to them? What if they had porn for women? Okay, but where does that content come from? From us.
 We make it.
 Jack, we we don't make Hear me out.
 Yes, I'm talking about doubling pay-per-view profits while cutting out the middle man.
 But I'm also talking about American businessmen doing what they were born to do.
 Make things.
 We've stopped making and become a country of consumers.
 Well, I, for one, am done consuming.
 And I'm ready to make.
 Liz? I don't believe it! Hello, Wesley.
 Don't you see this is just going to keep happening? You can't fight the universe.
 No, this isn't a coincidence.
 I wanted to see you.
 And I figured you wouldn't miss a tasting of the white wines of Scotland.
 Most restaurants refuse to serve them.
 Oh, yeah, you've only told me that, like, nine times.
 So does this mean you've come to your senses? Are you ready to settle and become Mrs.
 Snipes? No, I wanted to tell you to your face that I know that I can do better than you.
 And I'm never going to be Mrs.
 Snipes.
 Hang on, is your name Wesley Snipes? That is insane.
 It's insane that the actor Wesley Snipes has that name.
 If you saw a picture of him and a picture of me and you were asked who should be named Wesley Snipes, you'd pick the pale Englishman every time.
 Every time, Liz! Frankly, you should be having this conversation with him! Yeah, I'm going to go do that.
 I give it two months before you give up and decide to settle! I'll see you in May! For sweeps! That's what we call spring cleaning in England! Ugh.
 Hello, there.
 Well, hello.
 How was your day? Do you need to talk? 'Cause I'll just listen patiently and say things like, "Uh-huh," "How annoying," "She's clearly jealous of you," and "Well, it's his loss".
 You're a great woman.
 You deserve a great man.
 For just $24.
95 an hour.
 Yes, please.
 It's the yellow button, sweetie.
   

                




                    			A breakfast date? Who was this guy? Well, I met him on K-Date, which is the personals section of the Kraft Foods website.
 And what was he like? He owns a cockatiel named Arliss.
 Oh, God.
 But I'm not letting it get me down.
 I'm just going to keep putting positive energy out there and something good will come back to me.
 Good morning, Miss Lemon.
 A Mr.
 Debarber called.
 Seriously? A Mr.
 Debarber called.
 Floyd called? Oh, my God.
 That's amazing.
 What you said worked.
 Okay, universe.
 Send me a white football player.
 No kickers or linemen.
 Hey, Danny, congratulations.
 Congratulations? For what? Danny was nominated for a Juno, which is like a Canadian Grammy.
 Yeah, I recorded the psych-up song that plays during Ottawa Senators games.
 # The crowd's getting loud at Scotiabank Place # # Make a hockey-loving face # # It's no shebang place # I'm not going to win, but it's an honor just to be nominated in the same category as Sir Dave Coulier.
 Well, it should be great exposure for you.
 I know.
 And there's going to be a profile of me in The New York Times as filler because of dwindling ad sales.
 Isn't that awesome? I am sick of that guy's positive energy.
 We've got to start messing with him.
 Yeah, like, what if we trick him into kissing me? It'd be so funny, because I'm not gay.
 Or if the Pranksmen write that Times profile ourselves.
 Making Danny look like an idiot.
 And put it in the press packet that everybody gets.
 This is the most friends I've ever had.
 Kenneth? I'm having a Tracy and Jenna problem.
 Gosh, Mr.
 Hornberger.
 You say that so often, you should come up with a shortcut word for it, like "Ivatrennaprah".
 Well, Danny's interview with The New York Times comes out today, so "Ivatrennaprah".
 A what? If Tracy and Jenna hear about it, they'll get jealous and act out.
 And as much as I want to, I can't slap the brat out of them.
 So Tracy and Jenna will spend the day in the make-up room having full plaster impressions made of their faces.
 So that should shut them up for, uh, let's say 12 hours.
 Oh, my.
 That's a long time.
 Maybe I should keep them company.
 Yes, tell them your stories.
 They'll hate that.
 Silly Mister Hornberger.
 Always saying "hate" when he means "love".
 Hello, Floyd? It's Liz.
 Thank you calling me back.
 We have so much to catch up on.
 Yeah, so how are you? Oh, my God.
 You're not going to ask me what's wrong with my voice? I was being polite.
 Look, Liz.
 I'm sorry I haven't called in a while, But I'm in New York for a couple of days, and I, uh I'd really like to see you.
 Wow, great, okay.
 Um Just tell me now if you've grown a goatee.
 No, no, no goatee.
 Just Chola eyebrows.
 So are you free tonight? Uh, I have to work late.
 Can it be tomorrow night? Yeah.
 I mean, I'd love to see you sooner than that but you know, whatever works.
 Okay, well, I'll call you tomorrow.
 Okay.
 Perfect.
 Uh, I've got to run, call me.
 Ciao.
 Ugh.
 I don't know how this happened, Jack, but it's bad.
 I think I really screwed up.
 With a female page? Don't worry, they disappear all the time.
 No, I did an interview for The New York Times, and they printed all of this stuff that I didn't say.
 Typical liberal media.
 That's why I get all my news from Dick Cheney's website, dickviews.
 Com.
 I never said that Liz banged her way to the middle or that Jenna kidnapped a Swedish au pair to use as a hair farm.
 And I never called Tracy clean and articulate.
 Why would I? He's not.
 This stuff is in the newspaper, Jack.
 Everyone's going to see it.
 No, they're not.
 It's a hoax.
 What? The New York Times doesn't have a staff writer named Seymour Nips.
 You've been pranked by the Nerds.
 My guess is this is the work of Frank, uh the black one, and Lutz.
 The writers Why would they do that to me? Because they look at you, and you're everything they're not.
 You're handsome.
 So are you, Jack.
 I wasn't fishing, but thank you.
 Danny, we will not let this stand.
 Well, then, what are we going to do? I'm no stranger to the art of japery.
 At Princeton, I was in a secret society.
 I shouldn't tell you this, but one time, we snuck up to Dartmouth, put their mascot in a box, and sent it to Mexico City.
 We didn't know until the next day that it was an actual Indian.
 He didn't speak a word of English.
 Like all Dartmouth men.
 All right, I'm game.
 Let's team up.
 What should we call ourselves? What's the most handsome animal? A silver panther.
 Guess who called me.
 The Boob Job Recall Center? No, Floyd.
 We're having dinner tomorrow night.
 And I don't know what it means, but I am allowing myself to be excited.
 I mean, on the phone, it was like we were just right back there.
 Liz and Floyd.
 Liz and who? Come on, Floyd.
 My ex-boyfriend.
 The only good boyfriend I've ever had.
 Recovering alcoholic? He used to work in this building? Oh, you mean that guy? And, of course, this is our other finalist couple for the Today Wedding Contest.
 Floyd and Kaitlin.
 Whuck? And Old Gus is the biggest catfish in the pond.
 Legend has it the only bait that will catch Old Gus is a piece of Old Gus himself.
 So every time they catch him, they cut off a little piece of him.
 So they can catch him! Now how did the very first person catch Old Gus? Well, that's a story for another time.
 Right now.
 So if my grandfather hadn't gotten on the wrong train that day, he never would have met his wife's murderer.
 I wonder what Hawaii's state quarter is going to be.
 Nobody knows, but here are several hundred guesses.
 A pineapple.
 A coconut.
 Uh, Lemon, can I have your weakness files on Frank, Toofer and Lutz? Floyd's getting married.
 Maybe on the Today show.
 Floyd never told you? I mean, B's before H's, but that is low.
 This sucks, Jack.
 I know that I'm a sour person, and I don't like a lot of people.
 But I liked Floyd.
 And I guess, in the back of my mind, I thought we'd end up together someday.
 That you know, the whole thing would turn out like a movie where Christopher Cross sings a song like # All my days I've been waiting # # for you to come back home # # In moonlight of New York City # Lemon, I'm sorry.
 We all have our romantic pipe dreams.
 I thought that Nancy would leave her husband for me, and it's not going to happen.
 They're Boston Irish Catholic.
 They mate for life, like swans.
 Like drunk, angry swans.
 Vote for Floyd and Kaitlin! I love this woman! Oh, my God.
 I can hear him on the plaza.
 Hey, keep it down out there! This isn't Liz! Okay, it's bad enough that he is getting married, but does he have to do it right outside my window? No, he cannot win this contest.
 Lemon, I know you're hurt, and I know that look.
 But don't even think about revenge.
 You are not a Silver Panther.
 What are you talking about? Just stick to the high road.
 The low road is a slippery slope.
 I know, Jack.
 Believe me.
 It's like, on T.
V.
, it used to be you couldn't say "crap".
 Then, they let that slide, an now we can say whatever we want.
 Douchebag, asswipe Anal rot.
 Exactly.
 So I'm simply going to ask Floyd as a friend and former intercourse companion to do me the favor of not getting married right outside my window.
 I'm going to meet him tomorrow night at McShanley's for dinner.
 McShanley's? The place where you got food poisoning from the fish three times? So? So are you sure you're not planning to get Floyd sick and sabotage his chance of winning? What? No.
 Jack, that never even occurred to me.
 Then you will never be a Silver Panther.
 I don't care! I'll start my own group! Rejection from society is what created the X-Men.
 So to get there, you start on Old Barn Road.
 Then you take the first left, then the next left, then the next left, and then another left.
 That'll take you around the quarry, which is real pretty.
 I just wanted you to see it.
 That'll put you back on Old Barn Road.
 What have you got there? Have you guys seen this? We are getting a report from right here at Rockefeller Center that there is a toxic gas leak in the building.
 Whuck? The type of gas is unknown but it is triggering the building's auto locks.
 What's happening? Oh, my God! What do we do? I know a way out! What's wrong? How much of my life have I wasted putting things on hats? We are now getting reports that the toxic leak has created what police are calling a "Cloverfield"-type monster in the building.
 The monster cannot detect the smell of human skin.
 Anyone still inside should disrobe immediately.
 I'm keeping my hat on.
 I don't care.
 Give up, Lutz! Get your socks off! Gentlemen.
 I wanted some of the T.
G.
 S.
 Dancers to see this.
 Now, we're even, guys.
 As you were, Nerds.
 Surculus et Pruna.
 Surculus et Pruna.
 Now I don't have a lot of experience reading stuff out loud to people, so I'm going to do this the most normal way I can think of.
 "Space, space, space, space, space, space".
 "My Autobiography.
 "Space, space, space, space, space.
 "By Kenneth Ellen Parcell.
 "Space, space, space, space, space.
" Thank you.
 Good morning, ladies.
 Mm-hm, good morning.
 Liz, last night, I had a very graphic dream about Kenneth.
 What? Ugh.
 I know, it's disgusting.
 But Tracy and I had to listen to Kenneth talk for hours yesterday.
 He must have gotten into my subconscious.
 And then, I dreamed that he and I did I don't want to hear it.
 # La-la-la-la-la, da-da, oh # Good morning, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Oh, good morning.
 Lemaroney something horrible happened to me last night.
 I had a dream that Kenneth and I got intimate in a portable Jacuzzi.
 It was crazy.
 Glistening black and white skin.
 It looked like a close up of a killer whale being born.
 He got me too, it was horrifying.
 Now I never want to go to sleep.
 Just like this amazing city that we live in.
 I knew it.
 "Surculus et Pruna"is the motto of the Twig and Plums.
 And your motto is "Above all, be boring.
" Listen to me.
 Twig and Plums is a Princeton secret society, and Jack is clearly a member.
 So? So they have all kinds of weird rituals and rules.
 Like, if someone says "Twig and Plums" in front of a member, he has to find an excuse to leave the room, no matter what he's doing.
 During the period of the '90s Twig and Plums! Thank you, folks.
 Excuse me, I have tickets to a Harry Connick Jr.
 Concert.
 Jack messed with the wrong fat losers.
 Yeah.
 This issue is time sensitive, so hear me out before the overseas markets open for the day.
 Twig and Plums.
 Excuse me, gentlemen.
 I have a, uh veterinary appointment.
 What's up? How are you guys doing? Want to split some mozzarella sticks? I saw you on the Today show.
 Damn it.
 I could have sworn you watched The Early Show on C.
B.
S.
 The Early Show? What am I, in a hospital? I'm so sorry, Liz.
 You know, I just wanted to tell you everything face-to-face.
 I did not mean for you to find out about Kaitlin on T.
V.
 Believe me, If I had a time machine, I would go back and do it differently.
 You want to split some mozzarella sticks? Ah, I didn't go back far enough.
 Look, I want you to be happy.
 And obviously, you have a life to live.
 But your getting married is a big deal to me.
 So please, don't do it where I work.
 And don't drag my best friend, T.
V.
, into it.
 No, I get it.
 I do.
 But I'm sorry, I've got to do this.
 Look, Kaitlin is a yogarobics instructor and an ab model.
 I was in a reenactment on America's Most Wanted once.
 Playing a lady who was strangled on the toilet.
 And we're just hoping the exposure can help Kaitlin get some jobs here in New York.
 Here in New York? Wow.
 Let's just order.
 I'm sorry, Liz.
 I, uh No, don't be.
 It's fine.
 High road.
 So are you seeing anyone? You should try the fish! What would you like for dinner, Mr.
 Jordan? Barbecue? Or me? No! No! Are you all right, Tracy? I had another freaky "Kenmare".
 It's okay.
 We're going to get through this.
 Together.
 I just had another Kenneth dream.
 Me too.
 But how do I know this isn't a dream? Wait a minute.
 All my teeth are loose.
 So we're good, it's real.
 Tracy, my dreams are getting worse.
 This one was so graphic.
 Kenneth and I were married and living in Indianapolis.
 We had kids! What kind of sick mind dreams that? It was disgusting! We have to get him out of our dreams.
 We have to go back to how things were.
 Are you thinking what I'm thinking? We have to Elm Street this.
 We have to go to sleep and kill Kenneth in our dreams.
 I don't know who the hell told you to say that, Rossitano, but you have no idea what you're Twig and Plums.
 I have to go to an intervention for my travel agent.
 So that's your second salmon.
 How are you feeling? Like a rock star.
 Hey, excuse me.
 Can I get another salmon, compadre? Sauce on the side again, please.
 Eating healthy, 'cause I'm marrying a lady that keeps it fit.
 You know, nice and tight.
 You know kapow! You know.
 Are you okay? Hm, hells yeah! Yeah, I'm great.
 Whoa! This is my jam, right here! Ooh, my jam-a-lam! Mm-hm.
 So another Jack Glaze Salmon.
 And anything for you? Wait, what is Jack Glaze? It's our special sauce that we put on the salmon.
 It's molasses and honey and Jack Daniels.
 It has alcohol in it? No, no, he doesn't drink.
 Oh, don't worry.
 The alcohol cooks down with the fish.
 But what if you get the sauce on the side and it isn't cooked with the fish? That would explain why we have so many drunk kids here.
 Oh, what have I done? This is the slippery slope.
 There's alcohol in that sauce.
 You've been drinking alcohol.
 Trying to get me drunk? Squeeze in one last ride at Six Floyds amusement park? Well, we're closed, sorry.
 No, Floyd.
 I just wanted you to get food poisoning to mess up your Today show thing.
 Look, you're drunk.
 It's my fault.
 Let's get you back to the hotel.
 No, I would never do that to you.
 Get you drunk on salmon? Or any fish! I thought we cared about each other.
 Yeah, I did too.
 I thought the only thing keeping us apart was that you wanted to live in Cleveland.
 But you'll move to New York for Kaitlin.
 Yeah, I will.
 You know why? One, blonde.
 Two, she's alive.
 Like a deer.
 She runs and sniffs and jumps and stares.
 She's not like the badger, with its glasses and its rules about weekday sex.
 Those are good rules.
 People have work in the morning.
 How are you still single, Liz? There are so many guys out there that want to be poisoned and yelled at.
 Yeah, well, uh have a good night.
 Enjoy your salmon.
 Salmon for everyone! On me! This is a dream.
 You're in control.
 Why? I considered you a brother! It's working.
 We've joined forces in our dreamscape.
 Now we fly.
 What the hell are you doing? Uh controlling our dreams? We can explain, Pete.
 We were just trying to Elm Street Kenneth.
 Unbelievable.
 It is way too early for this, guys.
 I haven't even had my first cup of wine today.
 Tracy, it's morning.
 We slept all night and we didn't dream about Kenneth.
 We're cured! It worked! It's a miracle! No, I've got a lot of writing.
 Who's that from? That's my mom's room.
 Hello, Frank.
 I think you know where I am.
 I just happened to run into your mom at a T.
J.
 Maxx in Queens and we came back here for some cannol and red wine.
 She's a lovely woman.
 I'll be leaving soon.
 I'm a gentleman.
 As is Danny.
 Hey, Frank.
 Your mom's a hugger.
 Don't push me, Frank.
 You won't enjoy the next tape.
 Your mom might, though.
 And I believe Toofer and Lutz also have mothers.
 Do we understand each other? Pranksmen.
 Stand down.
 You wanted to see me? Uh, Lemon, have you seen the Today show this morning? Why? Floyd showed up, right? Funny you would ask that, but yes, he showed up.
 The problem is, he won't leave.
 In this hour, spring cleaning tips Boring! Boring.
 Floyd, come on.
 Hey.
 You guys wear so much makeup.
 You know that? Floyd! Have you been drinking? Shut up, Kit-Kat! Vote for Floyd and Kaitlin! Yeah! Right? Oh, God.
 Ah, false alarm.
 Saved it.
 All right, he got drunk with me last night.
 But it was an accident.
 And he was being a wang.
 I didn't think he would go on a bender.
 Lemon, you have to Fix this, I know.
 This is not the High road, I know, shut up.
 Kaitlin, you have every right to be furious at me.
 What I did was unconscionable.
 And I didn't have a lot of time, but to make it up to you, I hope that you'll accept these T.
G.
 S.
 Mouse pads and a man's wallet with the Dateline logo on it.
 I'm not mad, Liz.
 This is a relief.
 I thought he'd gone off the wagon because of me.
 No, even drunk, he only had really nice things to say about you.
 And your butt.
 God, I don't remember any of that.
 Did I fall down while I was with you? 'Cause my lower back is killing me.
 Oh, boy.
 Floyd, I am so sorry.
 No, Liz, there's a reason I quit drinking.
 You know, I probably would have left me there too.
 I really just want you to be happy.
 You too, Liz Lemon.
 So, go.
 Get married.
 Love each other.
 And if you go on a cruise for your honeymoon, may it be free of pirates.
 Audi 5000.
 Liz? Look, well, maybe this is crazy, but I don't have any female friends, because, you know, my body? And I was just wondering And now, I have agreed to do a reading from Corinthians at Floyd's wedding.
 So instead of avoiding seeing Floyd getting married I'm in the wedding party.
 Yeah.
 I've had enough of both of you! Your bad behavior stops now! Absolutely, sir.
 We promise.
 And we are never, never taking you for granted again.
 In fact, we'd like to sing you a "thank you" song.
 Thank you, Kenneth.
 Oh, I'll show you how to thank me.
 Let's do this.
 Wake up, wake up, wake up.
 Wake up, wake up.
   

                




                    			And I think we can both conclude that we finished Q-one with better than expected results.
 And I can promise that my performance will improve, especially if you're a little more flexible on your end.
 I love it when you talk dirty to me.
 I cannot wait to see you tonight.
 What are you going to wear? To a museum gala? Think slutty Grace Kelly.
 Oh, God bless you.
 I'm picturing it right now.
 Uh, and the opposite of that just walked in.
 Tell Liz I said hi.
 I will.
 Happy birthday, Jack.
 I got you a card.
 It's one of those new ones where you can record a message.
 Test, test, test.
 This is a test for Jack's card.
 # Wonder Woman! # Excuse me, how do you re-record on these things? Whatever, I'll definitely figure it out.
 Thank you, Lemon.
 But my true present is that exquisite ensemble.
 You look like a prison weed dealer.
 I'm coming back from a singles Dodgeball match, okay? Good God.
 The YMCA near my apartment offers a variety of singles activities, and I am forcing myself to go to all of them.
 Well, I'm glad you're trying.
 But I wish you didn't have to.
 Lemon, are you wearing a cup? Oh, I forgot.
 Only guys can get hurt there.
 I just wish it were easier for you.
 You need an Avery simple, fun, uncomplicated.
 As my good friend and fox hunting partner Mary J.
 Blige would say, "No more drama.
" Happy birthday! Nancy, what are you doing here? It's done, Jack.
 I'm divorced.
 Ruh-roh.
 Hey, how did your dodgeball thing go? Did you meet anyone? Not really.
 There was one okay guy.
 Eat it, bitch! What is wrong with you? He was flirting.
 Did you ever even talk to him? I yelled at him about a rule violation.
 Oh His foot was over the line.
 How many more of these things are you going to? Line dancing this afternoon.
 Then tomorrow is the wine and cheese tasting.
 Or, as I like to call it, "Singles Fart Suppression".
 Maybe I should go with you.
 Be your wingman.
 Well, thanks, Jenna, but you don't want to do that.
 No, it will be good acting research for me.
 I'm up for a role in National Lampoon's Van Wilder's Wingman Incorporated.
 I look forward to not watching that on an airplane.
 And this is our wardrobe department.
 Uh, Nancy, this is the star of our show, Tracy Jordan.
 Tracy, this is Not now, Jackie D.
 I heard on the walkie-talkies that there's a red-headed MILF walking around with some executive.
 You know what? That felt really good.
 So, I'll, uh, see you at lunch.
 Kenneth, would you please show Mrs.
 Dougherty I'm sorry, um Ms.
 Donovan to the elevator? Have we met before? You shut your mouth.
 Now you're having lunch? Does Avery know about this? Lemon, the grown-up dating world is like your haircut.
 Sometimes, awkward triangles occur.
 I feel like you've been saving that one.
 Obviously, this is unexpected.
 I really didn't think that Nancy would ever get divorced.
 Why would a lady get divorced at 50? Stick it out.
 Men die first, then you have two wonderful years, then you die.
 Yes, Nancy showing up is a gamechanger.
 But if I blow this up now, all three of us will suffer.
 So what are you going to do? I'm going to make the most of this opportunity.
 I'm going to pursue both relationships, see how they develop, and then make an informed decision.
 You're going to juggle them? No, even you can't pull this off, Jack.
 Mrs.
 Doubtfire "shimself" could not do this.
 You are going to blow it.
 And you're going to end up alone, and you're going to have to go to singles dodgeball.
 Put on these rec specs.
 This is your future.
 Lemon, no.
 Ugh God.
 The band is soaking.
 Ugh.
 You will not believe what just happened to me.
 A guy on the subway just called me a "biggledeeboo".
 What's a "biggledeeboo"? It's an 18th Century word for dark-skinned Moor.
 I've learned the word "black" in every language, just so I know when to be offended.
 Well, I'm sure it was just an isolated incident.
 Nah, I'm telling you, Dotcom.
 Old school racism is back.
 How can racism be back when we elected a black president? Barry Obams is the one who brought it back.
 So you're saying that racism is back because white people no longer feel sorry for us? Hey, something's going on.
 You know what I seen last night? A Slovin Shield commercial with a black burglar.
 Black man! That's not good.
 Come to think of it, I saw a white judge on Law and Order last night.
 Oh, yeah.
 It's back on.
 Get ready, son.
 All you've ever known is your affirmative action job and Queen Latifah Cover Girl commercials.
 And one, two, and hip, four, five, six, and seven, eight.
 I'm sorry, are we expecting more men? I'm Jerem.
 I collect posters.
 Look at me, Jerem.
 I know all the steps.
 Kind of.
 So I know you're, like, the man who has everything.
 You know, two of everything, in fact.
 Right.
 Hilarious.
 But I, um I got you a birthday present.
 It's goofy.
 Nah, it's it's nothing.
 Schwitzer's Salt Water Taffy.
 I haven't had this since that summer we worked on Cape Bilge.
 I didn't have the heart to tell Mrs.
 Schwitzer that you moved to New York, so I told her you were in jail for manslaughter.
 Oh.
 I even got them to make you that flavor we invented.
 Peanut butter and Miller High Life.
 Oh, Nancy, thank you.
 I love it.
 Mmm.
 So, I'm, uh I'm only in town a couple of days.
 Do you have to go to this black tie thingy tonight? Is it really better than me? Well, it's not better.
 It's different.
 There's no way of knowing, at this point, uh which is better.
 What? You're a wackadoo, Donaghy.
 Well, I want to spend as much time with you as possible.
 So, uh why don't we meet for drinks after? You sure? Yes, definitely.
 You always know you're at the right party when it feels like the Riddler is about to attack.
 Look at this guest list Harvey Weinstein, Glenn Beck, Ashley Olsen These are the people that make New York great.
 Come on, let's do the red carpet together.
 The Post will love it.
 "Money Bunny Avery Jessup steps out with 'Sexecutive' Jack Donaghy.
" Well, no, I can't have my picture taken with you.
 Someone might see it.
 What's that supposed to mean? Um I'm just saying you're a business reporter, and I'm trying to get F.
C.
C.
 Approval for the KableTown deal.
 It wouldn't look right.
 Like Santa Claus taking a shower.
 Okay, I think I get that.
 You go ahead.
 I'll meet you on the other side with a drink.
 Okay.
 Avery, over here! Chelsea! Hey, Chelsea Handler, over here.
 Liz I work here because I'm hilarious, right? Is this a trap? Earlier today, Tracy made the accusation that I am the beneficiary of affirmative action.
 Yeah, well, Tracy is a buffoon.
 That is a 15th Century term for a black pirate.
 Racist! Is my presence on this staff tokenism? Toofer, you are an invaluable member of our team.
 Then why are my paychecks a different color than Frank's? Because your salary does not come out of our budget.
 Look, Toof, you provide a point of view that is essential to keeping the diversity guy from bothering us.
 I do not want a job I did not earn.
 I am about to utter two words a Harvard man never says.
 "I'm cool"? No, I'm sorry.
 You can't set me up like that.
 Don't quit.
 I quit.
 Wow, you look like Mr.
 Monopoly.
 And you look like "you won second prize in a beauty contest, collect $10".
 Are you sure you don't mind just having a drink up here? I walked all the way to Battery Park today in high-heeled boots like a moron.
 Well, no, I prefer it.
 Something from the mini-bar? Oh, no, are you kidding me? With those prices? Left over from my Amtrak ride.
 That's my Donovan.
 So listen, uh I know we've waited a long time for me to be single.
 And I really want our first evening together to be special, and Oh, God, this is so queer.
 I guess what I'm trying to say is can we wait until the morning to fool around? 'Cause I'm exhausted, and I've got the night bloats.
 Yes, the morning.
 I'm exhausted too.
 Let's, uh, just watch T.
V.
 There's a Lee Marvin marathon on Turner Classics.
 I thought you said this wasn't going to be sexual? Oh, this is perfect.
 I should take this.
 Is everything okay? Is everything okay? Here are the bullet points.
 Jeter's apartment.
 We're playing beer pong.
 It's New York Yankees versus former mayors.
 I've got $10,000 on the mayors.
 Get down here.
 Oh, come on, Dinkins, you're killing me! What's going on? It's work.
 I've got to go.
 Uh, no.
 I have to go, I'm sorry.
 I'll call you.
 Don't work too hard.
 How's your episode of Three's Company going? Like Three's Company, it's titillating, yet anxiety-producing.
 I need your help, Janet.
 Aw, man, being Janet sucks.
 After the party last night, I went to Nancy's hotel room.
 Then Avery called and made an offer I couldn't refuse.
 Ew, were you with both of them on one night? You are officially a John Mayer-style garbage I didn't have sex with anybody.
 You were right, Lemon.
 I don't think I can do this.
 Whichever one I'm with, I think she's the one.
 How do you choose between Lee Marvin and Derek Jeter? On looks? Lee Marvin.
 I feel like I'm being pulled apart, and I need your help.
 Today, I'm going to the boat show with Nancy.
 Tonight is my birthday dinner with Avery.
 I hate the idea of Nancy having dinner alone at the hotel tonight, so I told her that you wanted to take her out.
 No, I have singles wine and cheese tonight.
 Then take Nancy with you.
 This whole thing is unfair.
 You're juggling two beautiful women while I have to pay to have kickballs whipped at me.
 This is gender inequity out the yang.
 This has nothing to do with the slight difference in our genders.
 Yes, it does.
 The older you get, the more distinguished you are.
 Meanwhile, I'm reading a book called Hiding Your Arms, Hiding Dating Over 35.
 Lemon, I am successful romantically because I am confident, open, and positive.
 You are negative, pessimistic, and in danger of becoming permanently sour.
 Is this you asking me for a favor? Look, if I don't handle this situation right, I'm going to lose both of these women.
 And even worse, they're both going to lose me.
 Okay, fine.
 I'll do it.
 Ugh.
 Ow, my eyes are stuck.
 Help me.
 I can't believe Toofer quit.
 Do you have any idea how much paperwork I have to fill out because of this? He left with his I.
D.
 Tracy, Tracy, Tray Buddy, will you call Toofer and talk some sense into him? Oh, yeah, just ask the black guy.
 'Cause we all know each other.
 Pete, could you tell a bald eagle to stop scaring me at zoos? You know, I've been wanting to say this for a few seconds now.
 This workplace has become a hotbed of old school racism.
 Come on, Tray, no one here is racist.
 Oh, yeah, how come I'm always forced to play "ridickerous" characters that "do-nuhnunciate" well? Uh So what? Look at Italians.
 We're always portrayed either as "goombahs" or "guidos".
 But we don't care, because we're successful members of society.
 So maybe your problem is that you're finally being treated like everybody else.
 Nah, You can play it off.
 But I know you're all secretly mad because we finally have a black Disney princess.
 You know, there actually hasn't been a white princess since 1991.
 Tiana, Mulan, Pocahontas, Jasmine.
 Wow, she's right.
 There are little blonde girls in this country who have no idea they can be beautiful.
 That's why I started Jenna's Kids.
 It's a summer camp that teaches pretty, blonde girls how to be mean.
 You call Toofer.
 Beg him to come back.
 Absolutely not.
 Of course not.
 The Aryan hates and fears the African man, as we so clearly saw in the Blade movies.
 What? No, I didn't want Toofer to quit.
 But I respect his decision.
 As a woman in this business Shut up, Liz.
 and in this world, I have never received special treatment.
 At work or in love.
 So why should anybody else? Oh, Liz Ugh! I love coming here.
 You know, this is one of the only restaurants in America with a veal tank.
 It just tastes better when you pick your own.
 You know, Jack, I think I know the real reason you were acting weird about doing the red carpet with me.
 Okay.
 You're self-conscious about our age difference, and you thought you'd look old standing next to me.
 I see.
 You're very perceptive.
 I get why it's on your mind.
 What, with your birthday and my amazing skin.
 And, sure, people in this restaurant might think you're my dad.
 Or that you're my prostitute.
 Exactly.
 But what does it matter? Uh Maybe it does matter.
 I mean, yeah, if I'd met you 20 years ago well, not you, because you would have been 16, which is, of course, wrong.
 I'm just saying, are we kidding ourselves with this? I'm 51 years old.
 Do you even know who Lee Marvin is? The sportscaster who bites ladies.
 Who cares? Then again, if I were with someone my own age, I'd miss out on a lot of things I want.
 I'd never have a family.
 Jack, relax.
 We've only been together a month.
 We don't need to worry about that stuff now.
 Especially not on your birthday.
 Are these the cufflinks Reagan was buried in.
 Don't ask how I got them, but I do know the access code to his pyramid.
 Oh, Avery, this is too much.
 No, it's perfect, Jack.
 Someday, you'll be as great a man as he was.
 I do like jellybeans.
 Look at me.
 I'm at a singles event in New York City.
 La-dee-da.
 I mean, sure, it's a little bright in here, and they could have rescheduled that youth karate class.
 Yes, Sensei.
 But this is fun.
 Oh, come on, it's pathetic.
 Why am I doing this? 'Cause you're living life.
 Hey, how are you doing? Did you see Avatar? Yeah, that new 3-D is amazing.
 Yeah, I don't know.
 I found myself rooting for our boys in uniform, not those blue hippies.
 But full disclosure, I had a couple of drinks prior to.
 You know, Liz? Yeah, I thought that Marine robot thing They weren't Marines.
 Some of them were former Marines, but they were mercenaries working for a space mining company.
 All right.
 Uh I'll see you later.
 What are you doing? I was warming him up for you, and you start talking about space mining? What, you want to just sit around and be wrong? Come on, Liz.
 Every man in this room is single.
 Who do you want to meet? Nobody.
 I mean, that guy has a beard.
 Who knows what's under there? Tattoo guy, too promiscuous.
 T-shirt tucked into jeans? Oh, that guy just looks like he'd be mean to me.
 God, Liz, you're so negative.
 Well, now, you just sound like Jack.
 Hey, I'm no relationship expert.
 The last time I used a birth control device, it was the '70s, and it looked like soap on a rope.
 But every time you say what you don't want, you sound like a cranky cow.
 And you're not that.
 You're smart and you're fun.
 So stop talking about what you don't want and start figuring out what you do want.
 And then, go get it.
 Jerem! Look how drunk I am! And how full of cheese my mouth is! That's not that much cheese.
 No, No, don't! No, it's okay.
 I don't want to hurt you.
 But I'll tell you what I do want.
 I want someone who will be monogamous and nice to his mother.
 And I want someone who likes musicals, but knows to just shut his mouth when I'm watching Lost.
 And I want someone who thinks being really into cars is lame and strip clubs are gross.
 I want someone who will actually empty the dishwasher instead of just taking out forks as needed, like I do.
 I want someone with clean hands and feet and beefy forearms like a damn Disney prince.
 And I want him to genuinely like me, even when I'm old.
 And that's what I want.
 You make much English.
 This is fun alcoholics meeting.
 Well, well, well.
 Never got a hand up.
 Is that right, Liz Lemon? What? Come on, Pete, I'm in a good mood.
 And it's over! While trying to find Toofer's dental records in Personnel down on the basement mezzanine, I pulled your file.
 Elizabeth I don't know how to pronounce your middle name Lemon.
 You attended the University of Maryland on a partial competitive jazz dance scholarship.
 So? So NCCA competitive jazz dance was created as part of Title Nine.
 You were able to pay for college because of a program that favored women.
 Favored women to correct an imbalance.
 There's more.
 You were only hired by the Second City because they needed someone who could remember to feed the theater cat.
 Oh, no, Otis And you're going to hate this one.
 The only reason N.
B.
C.
 Picked up The Girly Show is because of the flak they got from women's groups after airing the action drama Bitch Hunter.
 Happy birthday, bitches! Oh, my God.
 I'm no better than Toofer.
 Or Lutz with his B.
S.
 Inuit ancestry.
 Or you, whose dad was in the Masons with Dave Garroway.
 I shouldn't be here.
 This is America.
 None of us are supposed to be here.
 I need to dance this out.
 Jack, would T.
G.
 S.
 Have gotten on T.
V.
 If I was a dude? No, it was affirmative action.
 Why do you think your checks aren't the same color as Howie Mandel's? Two amazing gifts from two amazing women.
 Each gift symbolic of the woman who gave it to you.
 One, the past, a connection to home, and the man that you were.
 The other, the future.
 The promise Uh, yes, Lemon, I get it.
 I can't let this go on any longer.
 I choose Avery.
 Right? Yes.
 Okay, are you sure it's not just because you saw Avery last? No.
 Well Hey, Liz.
 How did it go with the guys at dodgeball? Did you let one in? Into your heart, I mean.
 God.
 It actually went okay.
 I'm sorry you and I couldn't get together last night.
 Yeah, me too.
 But now, I've got to run.
 But what do you say I come back in a couple of weeks, I cook you a pot roast, we drink too much wine, and see how it goes? That sounds amazing.
 We'll be keeping an eye on this story as it develops.
 But it's clearly a conflict of interest.
 And, at the risk of editorializing, I am personally outraged.
 What are you doing here? Liz has invited me back as a budgeted employee.
 Apparently, I'm the only one among us who can spell.
 Welcome back, James.
 Hang on.
 Who's James? As a condition of my re-employment, I have requested that I no longer be called Toofer.
 Great, new nickname suggestions, go.
 Victoria Q.
 Nerdballs.
 Kanye East.
 Supervirgin! Splock Short for "Black Spock".
 Threefer, because you're also gay.
 Okay, fine, fine.
 Toofer.
 I'll just go back to Toofer.
 Welcome back.
   

                




                    			Hey Did you know that everybody here went out last night? Without us? Oh, nerds! Nerds? Nerds.
 Yeah, Thursday Night Thunder.
 That's been going on for years.
 You know about it? How come I've never been invited? Don't you think that's a little bit rude? Well, I yelled "Baba Booey" at Walter Cronkite's funeral, so I actually have no idea of what's rude or not.
 Yeah, well, let me But I couldn't thunder last night, because I had to take Angie to the E.
R.
 She had some complications with her pregnancy.
 So that kind of trumps your little problem.
 Oh, yeah, you're right.
 How is she? Well, she's fine and the baby's fine.
 But they put her on bed rest until her blood pressure goes down.
 Well, listen, Tray, if there's anything I can do, please let me know.
 There is one thing.
 Could you take care of Angie like a husband until this whole assache blows over? Absolutely not.
 What about you, K? I'm on it, sir.
 Oh, my.
 I haven't seen your brow that furrowed since you saw that picture of Helen Mirren in a bikini.
 How is it possible? Is she a wizard? A question for another time, Lemon.
 I was with Avery last night, and I almost had a Nancy-related incident.
 Oh, Jack.
 Oh, Nan na.
 What? I was saying, "Oh, Nana.
" Have I not told you about my grandmother fetish? Avery actually tried to get on board.
 Later that night, she put some mothballs behind her ears and fed me peppermints.
 She is in it to win it.
 This can't go on.
 I'm making a decision about Nancy and Avery today.
 I'm going in the bunker.
 No distractions.
 I had Jonathan remove the bar and my collection of 18th century French erotica.
 I've had to make some tough calls over the years.
 Switching Sheinhardt's wig production to 100 percent Chinese cadaver hair.
 Turning down Dick Cheney's offer to become King of Iraq.
 Selecting the brand, new logo for N.
B.
C.
 It's fresh.
 But this Nancy, Avery thing is the toughest decision I've ever had to make.
 Well, I'm glad you're taking it seriously.
 Although sometimes, when you try so hard to find love, you can't see that it's been standing in front of you the whole time.
 Oh, good God, Lemon.
 What did you come in here for? Last night, I saw my entire staff out at a bar.
 They go out every week, and I'm never invited.
 Do they not even like me? Oh, don't worry.
 It's healthy.
 Bosses need to keep their distance from their subordinates.
 Mr.
 Donaghy I have to run out to Mr.
 Jordan's house.
 I'll call you when I get there so you know I'm safe.
 No, I don't care if you're safe.
 I love you! After four years, I thought I was close with these people.
 I thought we were a Don't say family.
 family.
 Then, I see them out at a bar without me giving each other windmill highfives.
 Like in Top Gun.
 But this is your staff.
 You can't let it bother you.
 You could always come up here and have a drink with me, a fellow manager.
 Oh, great, that sounds really fun.
 I'll just pour myself a drink.
 Oh, I dropped my glass.
 Is that supposed to be a broom? Anchor the handle.
 There it is.
 This better be important.
 I'm in a meeting.
 Mr.
 Jordan? The situation here has deteriorated.
 Great update, Ken.
 Thanks for checking in.
 Talk to you later.
 Actually, sir I think you should come home.
 Mrs.
 Jordan said she's going to turn her rings around if she sees me again.
 She wants you to come help her.
 What? But why? You're much better at that serving stuff than I am.
 Well, your wife thinks taking care of her should be your job.
 And I have to agree, sir.
 You made a promise to care for her in sickness and in health.
 Don't you remember your wedding vows? To be honest, I couldn't really understand anything Rick James was saying.
 Come home, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Mrs.
 Jordan needs you.
 Fine.
 I'll be there soon.
 And if you get hungry, you can help yourself to anything in the fridge.
 And once I'm there, I'll determine how much to charge you.
 Hey, buddies.
 Anybody do anything fun last night? What about you, Frank? What did you do? I, uh, had a doctor's appointment.
 Oh, really? For what? Oh.
 Oh, God.
 It looks like the underside of an octopus.
 Hey, Liz, can I talk to you and Jenna in the office where everyone clips their toenails? Not cool, guys.
 As you guys know, I'm getting married on May 22nd.
 You are? Still? Well, it was off for a while, because my fiance was on his dad's yacht and got captured by pirates.
 But now, thanks to the A-Team, he's back.
 Sure.
 He has a different energy now.
 He's quieter.
 But we're getting married.
 And are we still in the wedding? Of course.
 The bridesmaids are you guys, Andy Roddick's wife, my Dutch cousins, and Penelope Cruz's hotter sister, Monica.
 You're going to be so out of place, Liz.
 Anyway, my mom said that if you guys are going to throw me a work party, it has to be this week.
 Oh, no.
 Really? Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.
 It's just that the schedule's really filling up now that Aris is finally getting over his Stockholm Syndrome.
 Oh, that reminds me.
 You guys may have to walk down the aisle with some pirates.
 It's just, I don't think I can plan a party this week.
 I'm doing a juice fast and it's making me really grouchy.
 You know what? This is perfect.
 I'll have that party tonight.
 And it will be fun.
 And you'll all see that I'm fun.
 So screw both of you.
 And screw everybody out here! Liz Lemon is having a party! # And there ain't no party like a Liz Lemon party # # 'cause a Liz Lemon party is mandatory # All right, Donaghy.
 Follow your heart.
 Hard Equations And Rational Thinking.
 Damn you, HEART.
 I'm sorry, sir.
 There's a minor janitor problem.
 I apologize for letting a Kashmiri into your office.
 I just need five minutes of your time, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Now would be a good time, actually, to handle the janitor situation.
 But sir, what about I always say bosses should stay deeply involved with their subordinates.
 Does this mean you're coming to my cabaret? Jonathan, close the door.
 Please.
 So what can I do for you? It has been a week and I have heard nothing from you, sir.
 Have you forgotten our agreement? About me taking over 11:30? I'm sorry, what? Five years ago, I threatened to quit unless you got me out of the late night shift.
 Wow, other than some notable recent exceptions, N.
B.
C.
 Never guarantees employment terms five years in advance.
 I have a contract.
 That is my signature.
 You signed it on April 22, 2005.
 Okay, in my defense, every April 22nd I honor Richard Nixon's death by getting drunk and making some unpopular decisions.
 Well, I want the earlier shift.
 It's better pay and more prestigious.
 Ever since I am a little boy, I am dreaming of hosing the tonight shift.
 Okay, uh, calm down Khonani.
 I understand that I made you a promise, and we're going to keep it.
 Because this is N.
B.
C.
 The Biggest Loser network.
 So you'll fix this? Today? Well, this is a janitor emergency, and I really have no choice but to make it my number one priority.
 Good, thank you.
 Can I have those pictures for a special book the janitors keep? Absolutely not.
 Good Good monster.
 Good, scary monster.
 Hey, Ken.
 Isn't that a fun place to stand? Oh, I forgot to warn you about my dog, Tracy Sr.
 I trained him to hate white people.
 Because, not to profile, but most ghosts are white.
 This is my boy, here.
 And look what Angie did to him.
 She set up an invisible fence.
 He gets shocked if he tries to leave the property.
 Just because he'd run away and cause car accidents and impregnate neighbors' horses.
 He's trapped here, just like me.
 Sir, you're not trapped.
 Mrs.
 Jordan just wants you to be here for her.
 I'm trying, Ken! And I want to be responsible.
 But I've been me for a long time.
 Well, Mrs.
 Jordan isn't asking for a lot.
 Right now, she just has a craving for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
 No, we're not supposed to do any sex stuff while she's on bed rest.
 Oh, like, a real one! I'm on it.
 Maybe this will get Angie to stop calling me irresponsible.
 Just stay focused and take this sandwich to my wife.
 Nope, I'm in a strip club.
 My bad.
 Hey, Jenna, if I'm expecting about 20 people tonight, how much ice should I get? Oh, you don't want to mess with that stuff, Liz.
 Ice has caused a lot of O.
D.
 S in the porn community.
 Oh, you mean frozen water? Well, I don't know.
 I just, uh, don't want to forget anything.
 Don't worry.
 No one's expecting a lot.
 No, tonight is going to be different.
 There's going to be booze and a karaoke machine and that Black Eyed Peas song they wrote for bar mitzvahs.
 Jenna Maroney to the floor.
 Sure, it will.
 Hello? Lemon, you know Subhas, the current first shift janitor? Uh, kind of.
 According to the janitor community you call him frequently regarding home toilet situations.
 No, it's not that, we're dating.
 Lemon, please.
 Look, I just need his phone number.
 Wait, what does this have to do with Avery and Nancy? That is taking a backseat to this janitor situation right now.
 I need Subhas to step down.
 But Subhas does a great job.
 Look, five years ago, I promised Khonani the earlier shift.
 Why would you ever promise that? Honestly, these immigrants have a tough life no health care, and I kind of just thought he'd die before it became a thing.
 Are you sure that you're not just using this as an excuse to avoid your real problem? Lemon, this is a janitor emergency.
 I need that phone number.
 Okay, let me find it.
 Subhas Scrolling I know you know it by heart.
 All right, Khonani.
 If I've learned anything from recent experience, it's that we have to handle this next step with Subhas very delicately.
 Oh, don't worry, Subhas will want to leave, spend time on his hobbies.
 He collects classic car cardboard.
 Classic cardboard.
 Ken, why did you let me go to a strip club? I tried to stop you, sir, but you threw your dog at me.
 This is bad! Because I can't change.
 I'm like a chameleon Always a lizard! This better be a meeting.
 'Cause I'm important! Tracy, it's Liz.
 I want you to know that, at my party tonight, you are off the leash.
 I want to see the behavior that got you kicked out of the Inaugural Ball.
 I can't, L.
 L.
 First of all, the Secret Service never gave me back my t-shirt cannon.
 And second of all, I've got to stay home and take care of Angie.
 What? No.
 Come on, you have to come.
 I need you.
 This party has to be off the hook.
 People don't say that anymore.
 They say, "Surf Party U.
S.
A.
" Tracy, this is important.
 I have to prove to my co-workers that I am not some angry, un-fun woman who doesn't deserve to be included.
 Look, Liz Lemon.
 I know your feelings are hurt.
 But parties are like frisbees.
 If you throw them the wrong way, they'll veer off in a bad direction.
 And then your kid will fall into a quarry.
 What? Don't throw a party for vengeance.
 It will turn on you.
 Like your wife, after your kid has fallen into a quarry.
 You know what? Fine, I don't need you.
 I am going to crush this party Liz Lemon style.
 I don't know what to do.
 A party is in trouble, and I'm the only one that can save it.
 But your wife and unborn daughter need you here.
 I'm torn, K-Pax.
 I know I should be here, but my body's going to take me to Liz Lemon's.
 What do I do? Put the electric dog collar on me.
 It would be my honor.
 Subhas, thank you for coming in and for showing me your, uh, special book.
 More men in it than I would have expected.
 Book is book.
 Indeed.
 Now, Subhas, you've been with us a long time.
 And you've done great work here.
 But we need some new blood.
 I've decided it's time for you to step aside, and Khonani will take over at 11:30.
 No, I am in a union.
 Well, I have a contract.
 Meeting over.
 No, no, hold on.
 There's always another option.
 What if we reinvent the way people think about their nightly trash removal? No, thank you.
 What if the night shift just got a whole lot earlier? Gentlemen, there is a way for everybody to get what they want and for me to look like a genius and a hero.
 You are bull-crapping us.
 No, I am not.
 I am "innoventing".
 A word that I just "innovented".
 N.
B.
C.
 It's fresh.
 Man, Tracy Sr.
 Took off fast.
 He did not want to live here.
 Sir, far be it from me to question a plan this well thought out, but what's going to keep you from just taking the collar off? You're going to pour glue in the lock.
 That's how my kids keep me out of the liquor cabinet.
 And of course, I'll be here to help.
 No, Ken.
 There's something else you have to do.
 For all of us.
 Unfortunately, there's only one Tracy Jordan.
 But sometimes, he is needed in two places.
 You are Tracy Jordan now.
 Go.
 Go save that party.
 Yes, sir.
 Wait, I don't walk that well.
 There he is.
 How's your first day going? Oh, I don't know.
 You tell me.
 Khonani, I don't know enough about being a janitor to understand what you're trying to tell me.
 There's no trash, Jack.
 Ever since you moved Subhas to No trash left for Khonani.
 Okay, well, there's a solution to this.
 What if you and Subhas share 11:30? No, I wouldn't do that to 11:30.
 What are you talking about? What are you talking about? There are two people who want the same thing.
 They can't both have it.
 You need to make a decision.
 I can't.
 Damn it, I can't.
 Don't you think I know what it's like to have two amazing people who both want the same thing? I do.
 And with Nancy and Avery, I'm the thing, Khonani.
 I'm the trash shift.
 That sounds very difficult.
 It's impossible.
 It's paralyzed me.
 I just want everyone to be happy.
 It doesn't work that way.
 One person's heart is going to be broken.
 You have to choose.
 I'm sticking with Subhas, Khonani.
 I'm sorry.
 Okay, I know that was hard for you.
 And don't worry.
 I have a job for me at Fox woods.
 Foxwoods Casino.
 My cousin is head janitor there.
 You ought to get that cough checked out.
 This better be "meetment".
 I'm importing.
 Mr.
 Jordan? It's Kenneth Parcell.
 From work and friendship.
 Hey, Ken.
 With all the excitement, I forgot that Mrs.
 Jordan had asked me to get her blood pressure medicine.
 She left it in her car.
 But sir, her car is parked out on the street.
 Oh, my God.
 I know, it's outside the electric fence.
 Oh, my God! I just didn't want to go outside! It's chilly! I can come back.
 This is all my fault.
 No, this is something I have to do myself.
 You're a good husband, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Sir, is there any chance your dog followed me here? Yes, he probably picked up your scent and is hunting you.
 I suggest you cut off a finger and throw it in the river.
 Wow, Liz! Good work.
 This looks like the post-coital suite at the N.
B.
A.
 All-Star Game.
 Thanks, Jenna.
 Well, so now that everyone's here, maybe someone should say a few words.
 Absolutely.
 # Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care # # Jimmy crack corn, and I # What are you doing? Juice fast delirium, Liz.
 I'm glad you could all make it to Cerie's party.
 I don't have a lot to say.
 Just that the bar is open, and the karaoke machine is ready to go.
 Karaoke? Awesome.
 Yeah.
 You think I don't know what that is? I know about Thursday Night Thunder! And I know that I'm not invited! Uh-oh.
 I deserve to be loved.
 Oh, no, she's going wide.
 I am a proud, single woman.
 How did it become about this? Go out the window, save yourselves! I may not have a real family, but I thought at least I had one at work.
 Which is not what I wanted for myself, by the way.
 You think when I was a kid, I dreamed of some day paying $1200 for a karaoke machine to impress a bunch of pasty losers? And a professional singer who's beautiful, but doesn't know it.
 So now, let's all go around the room and apologize to me.
 Oh, my God.
 This is the worst Oh, I had nowhere else to go! Dog! Dog attack! Huh? Maybe this doesn't work on people.
 My neck! My swan-like neck! Must fight through it.
 Also must weed lawn.
 I made it.
 I'm on the other side.
 I'm free.
 I can go anywhere I want.
 Like Liz's party.
 Or one of those places where you skydive over a huge fan.
 Hmm, maybe it doesn't work on people anymore.
 It still does! Why is that thing following you? Hunting me.
 Electric collar.
 There's no fire escape in this room.
 Why are we even here? You make us show up, you start yelling, and then we get attacked by a dog.
 Cerie didn't even come.
 That's just a cardboard cutout of her.
 But I rescued her.
 Everybody shut up! We need to figure out what we're going to do.
 Oh, really? Now I'm a part of the group? Now, you like me because you're in trouble and you need someone to bail you out? Yes, that's exactly why we like you.
 We love you.
 You solve our problems.
 That's what you're good at.
 So what if you're not fun at parties? Yeah, you know who's fun at parties? Paris Hilton.
 Andy Dick.
 Tracy.
 And they're all going to burn in hell.
 Oh, God! If you deliver me from this, I promise every Sunday for the rest of my life, I'll go to Huh? I'm through it.
 Pizza Hut! I'll go to Pizza Hut.
 Look, if this is a family, that makes you the mom.
 And you don't want to go out drinking with your mom.
 You want Mommy to make the monsters go away.
 Everything's going to be all right.
 Ugh.
 Okay, Tracy Sr.
 Let's see what you've got.
 Run, run, my losers! Great party, Liz.
 Everybody take some cupcakes! Hi, Subhas.
 I have an extra headshot I was going to throw out.
 Unless you want it for something.
 No, you are not book.
 But why? What am I doing wrong? Wanting to be book is not book.
 Hmm.
 So you solved your janitor thing.
 Now back to Nancy and Avery? Top Gun high-five for courage? Only because you look like you need it so badly.
 I'm fine with that.
   

                




                    			Lemon? I just got my bridesmaid's dress for Cerie's wedding.
 It is a Vietnamese size two.
 Dressing up isn't any easier for men.
 Do you know what it's like when a younger man shows up wearing the same cufflinks? You might as well be invisible.
 Yeah, well, I'm not going to let this dress win.
 I have a plan.
 This morning, I joined a A suicide cult? gym.
 What do you want, Jack? I just received a call from Don Geiss' estate lawyer.
 Apparently, I have been named in his will.
 I know this is a difficult time for you, but word of advice? If the will says that you have to spend the night in a haunted house, you better hope that everybody else there is black guys and sluts.
 I just want something to remember the man by.
 Okay.
 His pen or his tie clip.
 Maybe that boyhood sled he held so dear.
 I believed he called it "Sleddy".
 Something which I, in turn, can then pass on to my protege'.
 Any chance it's one of those bendy hospital beds? Maybe, he did have three.
 He was such an amazing man.
 Before we rehearse, I have an announcement to make.
 Our boy, Grizz, is getting married on May 22nd.
 Jeez, another wedding.
 Life is like T.
V.
 Testing tells us that people like weddings, births and episodes where a character dies.
 That's dumb.
 My heart.
 So I thought Grizz might want to take this time to announce who is going to be his best man.
 Um I haven't decided yet.
 "Um I haven't decided yet.
" You sound like my mother talking to the Planned Parenthood lady.
 Seriously.
 Which one of your rich and famous friends with Hepatitis B are you going to pick? Let's not do this in front of everybody.
 "Let's not do this in front of everybody"? You sound like my mother being pulled onstage at a Two Live Crew concert.
 Damn, my mother had problems.
 Oh, brother.
 We have to tell Jenna we can't do her Kardashian sketch because Jack is bros with Lamar Odom.
 You are such a coward.
 You think I care what you think? Hey, Jenna.
 So look We can't do the Kardashian sketch.
 Okay, I understand.
 Pete, there you are.
 I heard one of your kids broke his arm.
 Oh uh, yeah.
 The shed I built collapsed on him.
 Well, is he going to be okay? What's going on? Why are you being so happy and nice? Are you soaking your tampons in vodka again? No, it's just Well, I met a guy, okay? It's just been a few weeks.
 We're not putting labels on anything yet, because the glue is abrasive.
 But I'm really happy.
 Is there any chance this might make our lives easier? No way.
 I have seen this 100 times.
 She gets psyched about some guy, he reveals himself to be crazy, then there's a terrible breakup, and we suffer.
 Remember when she dated that sniper? And so, it's over.
 Jenna, there's a laser sight on your forehead.
 Oh, please, he's not going to fire.
 For God's sakes, he's scared of his own mother.
 Aren't you, Alan? Whoever this new guy is, we need to figure out his deal before she gets burned and takes it out on us.
 Tell me about it.
 Remember this breakup, when she bit me? Pete, that was, like, two years ago.
 It just won't heal.
 That concludes Mr.
 Geiss' financial disbursements.
 I believe all have been accounted for.
 His daughter, his lovely wife, his even lovelier mistress, his secret Canadian family, and his even more secret attic family.
 All that remains are a few personal items.
 "To my daughter, Kathy, I bequeath my pocket watch.
 It comes with very specific instructions for care, the most important of which is to not let the piece get wet.
" "To my protege' and friend, John Francis Donaghy, I leave a gift from the gardens of my estate in Connecticut.
 My beloved pet peacock, Argus.
" Oh Hello, old friend.
 Ugh.
 Vietnamese size two.
 Beth I hope it wasn't awkward for you when Tracy brought up my wedding.
 Why would it be awkward? Because of our sexual past.
 Ugh.
 Leave it open.
 I'd feel safer.
 How can I help you, Grizz? Well, Tracy keeps pushing To be your best man.
 Yeah, I noticed that.
 But I want to pick Dotcom And you're afraid that Tracy will freak out.
 So you want me to help you convince him to step aside.
 You know my every thought, Beth.
 We really were the Sam and Diane of this place.
 Liz Pete I want you to meet someone.
 This is my boyfriend, Paul.
 Pete Hornberger.
 Hi.
 But you can call me Dallas.
 This could be the start of something for me.
 It's really nice to meet you.
 And I'm a big fan of the show.
 Yeah, so Paul, what's your deal? How did you guys meet? Through a mutual fund.
 Friend, Jenna.
 Of course.
 Through a friend fund.
 Noted.
 And what do you do for a living, Paul? Oh, I work for a bank.
 Rupt circus.
 He works for a bankrupt circus.
 Okay, he's hiding something.
 I'm guessing already married cat strangler.
 Mm.
 Hey, could I just get a signature? Living dinosaur.
 Lemon? This is Argus.
 He was a gift from Don Geiss.
 His last gift, to be exact.
 Why did Don Geiss have a peacock? Is that an N.
B.
C.
 Thing? No, Don owned Argus long before he bought N.
B.
C.
 Uh, peacocks can live up to 40 years.
 Longer if they're not part of Mike Tyson's home zoo.
 What a weird gift.
 Uh, not at all.
 When Don was first taking me under his wing, he and I would sit on the veranda of his home in Connecticut.
 Talking about business, politics, how to avoid getting paper cuts while making love on a pile of money.
 And our friend, Argus, would strut proudly through the garden.
 We three peacocks felt like we owned the world.
 Well, that's a God, how did he get up here so quick? You know, I've never told anybody this before, Lemon, but Don and I had nicknames for each other.
 Like we might someday, J-Town? We called each other sempai and kohai.
 Master and pupil.
 Terms we learned on a trip to Japan.
 Because they played the movie Rising Sun on the airplane.
 Don was my sempai.
 And now, this bird is all that remains.
 Jack, I'm really sorry for your Oh, his feather went in my mouth.
 Oh, it's so oily.
 Lemon, he's marked you.
 He thinks you're his wife.
 Go.
 Get out.
 Hey, Tracy.
 Grizz and I were just talking.
 Of course, you guys are very close.
 Continue.
 And we had an amazing idea.
 We thought that maybe, at the wedding, you could be the lead singer of the band.
 Really? I'd be awesome at that.
 You would.
 Now, of course, you couldn't sing and But who's going to tell U2? The wedding band is U2? No, you two idiots.
 I see what you're trying to do.
 You're trying to manipulate me into not being the best man.
 And damn it, Grizz, I've known you since you were six feet tall! I'm going to be your best man! I am the leader of this entourage! And because of you, I'm having a tantrum! Now pick up that table and smash it for me! Best man! I know that! Hey, Jenna.
 What are you doing? I'm just feeling the weight of Jenna's jewelry on my finger pads.
 Pete! Pete! Dallas! What's up? Paul is getting weirder.
 We have got to step it up.
 You know what we should do? We should follow him.
 I don't care how long it takes.
 What's going on? Your kids have a play tonight? Oklahoma.
 They couldn't find cowboy hats big enough for my kids' heads, so they're just wearing turbans.
 It's on.
 When Paul leaves, we follow him.
 C.
I.
A.
 Style.
 And afterwards, I go to the gym.
 Words are the first step on the road to deeds.
 You wanted to see me, sir? Oh, my.
 What a gorgeous swamp eagle.
 This is Argus.
 He is very special to me.
 Is he okay? I don't know.
 He's become listless, and he won't eat any of the peacock food I got at the crazy rich person's pet store.
 Frankly, I don't know what to do.
 He's recently taken a mate.
 Lemon.
 Good luck, Argus.
 Well, sir, there's nothing wrong with this bird.
 He's just very old.
 Argus probably doesn't have very long to live.
 All of your page duties stop right now.
 The welfare of this bird is your only concern.
 He lives, or you die.
 I was about to suggest the same thing.
 Hey.
 Dummy What are you doing to Grizz? Whoa, you watch your mouth before I show you the back of my hand.
 Look, you've got to grow up about this best man thing.
 Liz Lemon, I don't even want to be best man.
 Why would I? Show up on time? Not lose a ring? Keep my shirt on through a dinner? Then why are you throwing a fit about it? Because I'm trying to protect Dotcom, dummy.
 He's in love with Grizz's fiancee', Feyonce'.
 Oh, your stutter is back.
 No, Grizz's fiancee's name is Feyonce'.
 Like Beyonce with an "F".
 Oh, come on.
 Listen, we cannot make Dotcom get up there and give a speech at that wedding.
 It would kill him.
 Wow, I can't believe that you are using your infantile selfishness for good.
 I'm impressed, Tracy.
 You think that's impressive, watch me stand on one foot.
 Hang on, I did it earlier.
 You're right, Tracy.
 You've got to convince Grizz to choose you.
 No, you do.
 Why do I have to do everything? Oh, I am never going to fit in that dress.
 Bored.
 What? Oh That's a bar.
 We're going to have to drink a lot to fit in.
 I don't understand where he went.
 Can I get five more beers here? Name's Dallas.
 I don't get it.
 Did we lose him? What if he's in a secret back room doing pot? Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Miss Jinah Baloney! What did he say? Is that Jenna? No, it's Paul.
 # My muffin top is all that # # Whole grain, low fat # # I know you want a piece of that # # But I just want to dance # I'm Jenna.
 Naturally.
 Jenna's boyfriend is a Jenna Maroney impersonator.
 Work it, Miss Thing! Oh, God.
 I'm going to need five more cranberry juices over here.
 Jack.
 I just found out that Jenna is dating a guy who does a drag show.
 As her.
 Lemon, what is with this food layout? Kenneth says he needs some sumac bark and shrub yellow root to make a poultice for Argus.
 How is your thing weirder than mine? I am not letting that bird die.
 And why does he have to? For God's sakes, if we can put an ear on a mouse's back, we can certainly make a peacock immortal.
 Oh, Jack.
 I know this is important to you.
 But it is just a bird.
 I mean, do you think maybe you're so worked up about Argus because you never let yourself grieve for Don? I did grieve for Don.
 As soon as Jack Welch told me, I went through all five stages of grief.
 Don is dead.
 What? You didn't do anything.
 Let me retell it in slow motion.
 Don is dead.
 See? Sir, I just want to let you know Argus is sleeping.
 And you left him alone? What if he rolls over on his back and his cloaca fills with mucus? Oh, brother.
 This is not about some peacock.
 We're going to have to help him, Kenneth.
 I have an idea, but you're going to have to take the lead.
 Because I am stretched pretty thin.
 Well, not "New York thin," but Don't worry, I'm on it, Miss Lemon.
 Sorry.
 Mrs.
 Argus.
 Okay.
 Beth, I need you to do something for me.
 Yeah, actually, I need to talk to you about the wedding.
 I'm too upset to talk.
 Look at me.
 What's this? Grizz has asked me to read this to both of you.
 "Dear friends, I don't want any more fighting or bad feelings.
 Tracy, I love you, but I've known Dotcom ever since we went to Above the Beanstalk a free summer camp for giants.
 I want him to be my best man.
 And if you care about me, you'll respect my decision.
 I will always be your" Oh, no, I'm white.
 I can't read that word.
 Um"Friend from the neighborhood.
 Grizz.
" I'm so honored.
 Now no one is getting hurt.
 No one at all.
 Thanks, guys.
 I'm so happy.
 Hey, Jenna.
 So nice to meet Paul.
 Interesting guy.
 How much do you know about him? Well, I lost a toe ring in him, so I'd say a lot.
 No, I mean, like, what he does at night.
 And what he wears there.
 And who he's being.
 So you know about Paul's act.
 Wait, you know about Paul's act? How do you think we met? Paul won a Jenna Maroney impersonator contest, at which I came in fourth.
 And now you're dating him? That's it.
 Right there.
 That face.
 That is exactly why I didn't tell you about Paul in the first place.
 Your judgmental badger face.
 Jenna, even for you, this is weird.
 Be a friend, Liz.
 Until then, I don't want to talk to you.
 Looks like one of us is in trouble.
 How is he? He's awake, but But what? Well, sir, I've spent a lot of time with pea fowl.
 They make all sorts of different noises.
 Oh, that's a car alarm.
 Kenneth, what's your point? It's just I've never in all my life heard a peacock say "sempai" and "kohai".
 What did you say? Sempai and kohai.
 At least, that's what it sounded like.
 Kenneth, I've been under a lot of strain lately.
 But do you believe a human soul could be transferred into an animal vessel? Sir, I think that there's a lot about this world that we don't understand.
 Like the afterlife.
 Or how bread turns into toast.
 Liz, I am in love with Grizz's fiancee', Feyonce'.
 Oh, my God.
 I definitely didn't know that.
 Would you talk to Grizz and convince him Tracy should be his best man? Okay, yeah.
 I'll try to help.
 But can I please go to the gym first.
 No.
 Hello? Badger.
 It's another badger.
 The third badger has taken the bait.
 Why is everyone code named Badger? I thought you said you wanted to do it this way.
 No, I said I didn't care.
 Jenna, can we please talk about this before it becomes big Ah! Hello, Liz.
 Jenna told me I didn't need to hide from you anymore.
 All right, let's cut to the chase.
 What's your game, friend? What are you getting out of this? What am I getting out of this? Yeah.
 I am the luckiest "shman" in the world.
 I get to be with the most talented, beautiful, sexy woman ever.
 So you aren't just using her for your act? My act? I'd never tuck my penis again if she asked me.
 All I want to do is spend my days listening to her talk and sing and scream at her cleaning lady on the phone.
 To be honest, Liz, I just don't understand what she gets out of it.
 I think I do, Paul.
 She finally gets to love herself.
 It's perfect.
 What are you two talking about? You, Jenna.
 Ooh.
 This situation is empirically weird.
 But I'm glad you're happy.
 I heard what you said about me.
 You're so sweet.
 God, you're incredible.
 Okay, guys, let's just Ew, Jenna, why are you grabbing his boobs? I don't know, Argus.
 Maybe it's the Scotch talking, but I think there might be a man's soul inside you.
 This is crazy.
 But Don, if you're in there, give me a sign.
 You want a drink.
 Don Sempai.
 There's just a few things I want you to know.
 You were the father that I never had.
 Just let me finish.
 I want to live the rest of my life in a way that will make you proud.
 I just wish you could be here to watch me do it.
 Goodbye, sir.
 All right, Grizz.
 I'm going to speak frankly to you now.
 And I can do that because of our sexual past.
 Damn, Beth, let it go.
 Don't even have a best man.
 Your wedding day is about you and your bride.
 So who cares what anyone thinks? Love isn't judgmental.
 Love is patient.
 Love is weird and sometimes gross.
 Love is elusive.
 And you found it.
 So treasure it.
 And maybe don't leave it alone with Dotcom.
 That was beautiful.
 Look at me Crying like a baby.
 So now I am Grizz and Feyonce's Woman of Honor, and he wants me to give the same speech At the Hunts Point Marriott while wearing a dashiki.
 So you're In three weddings on the same day, yeah.
 You're welcome.
 # When I was young # # I never needed anyone # # Making love was just for fun # # Those says are gone # # All by myself # # Don't want to be # # All by myself anymore # This is awesome.

                    			Hey Can I get your "Lucretia Mott" on this? Uh, what is this? Budget approval for travel and hotels for the moms.
 The moms? What moms? The staff moms that are going to be on the Mother's Day show that N.
B.
C.
 Is making us do after their ill-fated decision to reair the pilot of Bitch Hunter.
 Put the mimosas down! Bitch.
 Wait, it's Mother's Day already? Did you forget? Colleen is going to kill you.
 There's still time.
 Jonathan.
 Jonathan.
 Call the florist and order a dozen No.
 Too late, Jackie.
 Hey.
 Why isn't my beautiful Frank up on the wall? Ma, come on.
 That's just for the actors.
 Huh.
 Here's a picture you can use.
 It's little Frankie in the bathtub, getting ready for the senior prom.
 Thank you.
 Mom, what are you doing? You don't have to pay for the food.
 Honey, nothing is free.
 You remember that when a man buys you an expensive meal.
 Yeah, that's happening a lot.
 Hey, Verna.
 Well, you must remember my mom, Margaret.
 Oh, yes, we met a few years ago when the girls lived in Chicago.
 You must have me confused with someone else.
 I have never been to Chicago.
 I sexually assaulted Scottie Pippen in 1997.
 There's my baby! Oh, Mommy! Look, Tracy, this Mother's Day show is tomorrow and we haven't been able to track down your mom.
 I gave Kenneth her information.
 "Her name might be Cheryl, and she was wearing a red shirt in 1984.
" Look, I don't want you to be alone up there with all the families, so what if I hire an actress to play your mom? Okay, but whoever she is needs to be someone as amazing as I am.
 I want to see a list of names.
 Like when they was looking for John McCain's running mate.
 I'm kidding.
 This needs to be taken seriously.
 Happy Mother's Day, Colleen.
 I'm not here about Mother's Day, John Francis.
 You know who's in my water aerobics class down in Florida? Yes, mother.
 I memorized the names of everyone in your water aerobics class.
 Patricia Goodband.
 Whose sister runs the Friday night bingo game at Our Lady of Reluctant Integration in Waltham.
 Turns out last week that the game was won by Anne O'Connor, who mentioned that her niece, Nancy Donovan, got divorced and was running around with a hot-shot in New York City who pours scotch like a woman.
 If I don't always share my personal life with you, Colleen, it's because you've never approved of any woman I've shown an interest in.
 Now, that's not true.
 I'm not having this conversation with you right now.
 I have work to do, and I'll be joining you for lunch.
 In the meantime, Kenneth, here, will, uh entertain you.
 Okay, Kenneth.
 Entertain me.
 # Oh, the fiddle's in the creek # # and the frog's in the kitchen # I apologize, ma'am.
 That is not a song.
 You make me very nervous.
 Oh, my God.
 Hey, Lutz.
 This is my mom, Miho.
 Oh, hi.
 I didn't know you were adopted.
 What? Thanks a lot, Lutz.
 Mom, this is Lee.
 He's the head of our wardrobe department.
 Well, hello, Lee.
 Wrong tree, Mom.
 Got you.
 So Lee is going to take care of your clothes for the show.
 Oh, no, no.
 That won't be necessary.
 I brought some real cute duds.
 I made us both rompers to wear.
 Excuse me.
 My friend has to go strangle her Anxiety Pillow.
 Lee, It's the bridesmaid's dress.
 I can't breathe! I'm going to die in here! Bridesmaid? It's bad luck for a married woman to be a bridesmaid.
 It brings fever and disease.
 Yeah, well, I'm not actually married, so Not even common-law? How do you get credit at a mattress store? You know, my Johnny's single.
 And he gives excellent backrubs, I can assure you.
 Thank you, Mrs.
 Lutz.
 And thank you, moms, for your interest.
 But I just haven't met "the one" yet.
 Oh, for crying out loud, Liz.
 You see, that's what feminism does.
 It makes smart girls with nice birthing shapes believe in fairy tales.
 Stop waiting for your prince, Liz.
 I'm not waiting for a prince.
 I'm waiting for Astronaut Mike Dexter.
 Oh, sweet lord in heaven.
 Who turns out to be the secret King of Monaco.
 Liz, you're almost 40.
 You're not going to find some new kind of man.
 Whoever "the one" is, you've probably already met him.
 You're 40? John is looking for a greener banana.
 Hello, Verna.
 I'm glad to see you're here upholding your end of our bargain.
 Oh, yeah.
 I'm being a great mother.
 Listening, giving advice, asking stupid questions during movies.
 But I need you to hold up your end.
 That money order you sent That was only for half.
 Uh, that was a down payment, Verna.
 You'll get the rest after you've fulfilled your Mother's Day duties.
 That's kind of a problem for me.
 'Cause I already spent that down payment on the first half of my boob job.
 It's not an implant.
 It's just a little yank-up, you know? I mean, I got the meat, Jack.
 Go ahead, feel them.
 Feel the difference.
 Very different, indeed.
 Like a cantaloupe and a Ziploc bag of mushroom soup.
 But you're not getting the rest of that money until you give Jenna all the Mother's Day love she deserves.
 Whatever.
 Narc.
 Good news, Tray.
 We found a great mom for you.
 Her name is Novella Nelson.
 Novella Nelson? Oh, wait.
 Is she Aquaman's girlfriend? No, she's a great actress who lives in Brooklyn.
 She looks like you.
 That could be anyone! We all look the same to me.
 Is she famous? You'd probably know her best from a commercial they air a lot during the 3:30 A.
M.
 SportsCenter.
 Ugh, these overalls are chafing.
 I can't wear these pajamas fishing.
 Pajamaralls.
 Pajamar-always.
 What about the list I gave you? Phylicia Rashad, Serena Williams They're too recognizable, Tracy.
 And Serena Williams is younger than you.
 Who cares? She's awesome, and so am I.
 I want Serena Williams to be my mother.
 We've already booked Novella.
 The woman has been in the business for 40 years.
 I think she's good enough for the star of Sherlock Homie.
 I know what you're thinking, Mother.
 And we are not talking about Nancy Donovan.
 I don't want to talk about Nancy Donovan.
 I want to talk about the little, blonde girl that you are sleeping with.
 What? A mother knows, Jackie.
 Oh, hi.
 Are you going up? Down, actually.
 Oh, I forgot my phone.
 Two women, Jack? At the same time? What are you, Italian? I didn't choose for it to happen like this.
 Be a man and pick one.
 I can't.
 They both give me different things.
 One connects me to the man I was.
 The other inspires Just listen to yourself, Jack.
 I know it's gay.
 But it's my gay problem.
 And I'm handling it.
 We're ready to order now.
 Just bring my son one of everything.
 That way, he doesn't have to choose.
 Hey! Um, why was I given this to wear on the show? Well, I loved your idea that we both wear the same outfit.
 I just thought this one might be more T.
V.
 Friendly.
 You mean, instead of the rompers that your mother slaved over.
 Mom, this isn't Florida.
 You're damn right it isn't.
 In Florida, everybody is always asking me, "Where did you get that? You made it? Holy crap! Where do I commission one?" Oh, this is about you making money selling junk.
 Oh Verna, this is my job.
 And I know you don't understand that, 'cause you haven't had a job in 15 years.
 Because of my back.
 Because of the trampoline accident.
 But I need to look a certain way on T.
V.
 Oh, you are nothing but a spoiled brat.
 You know what? Here's what I think of you and your fancy clothes.
 That is quality stitching.
 Damn the tiny, brown hands that made this.
 Oh, there you are.
 Just thought I'd tidy up.
 That's my computer.
 Oh, no, dear.
 A computer is a great, big thing with a green screen.
 Mom? Do you think it's weird that I'm still single? Well, your standards are very high, as they should be.
 I remember someone who got a three on her history A.
P.
 Test.
 But do I expect too much? Maybe the moms were right.
 Maybe I should have just settled.
 I can't tell you what to do, Liz.
 But I know from experience that that guy, that perfect guy, is out there.
 Because I know I found mine.
 See, that's all I want.
 What you and Dad have.
 Oh, I'm not talking about your father.
 Whuck? What do you mean, you're not talking about Dad? You love Dad.
 Of course I do.
 But Dick Lemon isn't Ed.
 Ed? Who's Ed? Ed was my true love, sweetheart.
 He was my steady at Montclair High.
 The night before he was shipped off to Korea, I repeatedly lost my virginity to him, while Waldo, the town perv, watched from the bushes.
 Wait What? Nothing, Younger Me.
 It's fine.
 He wanted to get married.
 But when he was invited to Houston for his astronaut training He was an astronaut? You could have been an astronaut's wife? It wasn't that simple, Liz.
 I had just graduated from secretary school, and I got a job at Sterling Cooper.
 I couldn't just pick up and move.
 I was already 26.
 An old maid.
 Different times Octomom.
 So I settled.
 For a wonderful man.
 And I have never regretted it.
 Not even when I watched Ed Aldrin walk on the moon.
 Wait Your Ed is Buzz Aldrin? Yeah, but I always called him Ed.
 Because our town had, like, five Buzzes.
 You could have married Buzz Aldrin? You should regret that, Mom.
 You should have followed him.
 Laura Linney could have played you in the H.
B.
O.
 Original movie Moon Wives! Where are you going, Verna? Oh, I quit.
 I've been working my ass off pretending to be a good mom.
 But Jenna doesn't appreciate it.
 I see.
 Well, then, good luck paying for that other implant.
 It's not an implant, Jack.
 I mean, I got the meat.
 Of course.
 I apologize.
 Verna, you have a very simple decision to make.
 Quit, don't get paid, and drive around with one headlight out, or swallow your pride and get the money you need tomorrow.
 They said they were going to put a wig on me or something.
 So that, uh, nobody would recognize me as the Pajamarall lady.
 Like anyone would recognize you, anyway.
 I'm sorry, what did you say? You are way beneath me, Novella.
 I am a movie star, a television actor, and a Guinness Book of World Records holder for most car accidents in a single year.
 Maybe you wanted someone more high profile.
 But I am what you've got.
 So, Tracy, you'd better watch yourself, or you may wind up with no mother at all.
 Fine, I'd rather be up on that stage all alone than to be with someone whose resume has "Black Judge" on it nine times! And you think I wanted a fake son who recorded an anti-condom P.
S.
 A? I saved a lot of kids from lame sex! You little ingrate.
 All right, start with taxes, then insurance.
 Change this to Latin America.
 I can't say Nicaragua.
 Ah! You must be Avery.
 Yes.
 I am so sorry, Miss Jessup.
 Mr.
 S Donaghy keeps tricking me and running away.
 But not anymore.
 Carl? They need you out in the hall.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Mrs.
 Donaghy.
 You must be Jack's mother? Indeed, I am.
 And Jack has told me so much about you.
 You're going to have to work your backside.
 Because chest-wise, you have the measurements of an altar boy.
 I wish Jack had told me you were in town.
 Well, men have their little secrets, don't they? Especially Jack.
 Secrets? What I'm trying to say is if you're serious about Jackie, let him know now.
 A man like Jack has other irons in the fire.
 I beg your pardon? Oh, look at the time.
 I've got to get back to, uh calling Kenneth "Carl" to see if he ever corrects me.
 Carl! Yes, ma'am? Lemon, have you seen Colleen? Kenneth was supposed to be watching her, but I just saw him with his eyes closed, counting to infinity.
 You want to talk about moms, Jack? Listen to this.
 My mother could have married Buzz Aldrin.
 Oh, really? I know Buzz.
 We met at a photo shoot for Vanity Fair's annual "Awesome Gentlemen" issue.
 My mom blew it, Jack.
 She had true love and she threw it away.
 Just because it was inconvenient.
 Lemon, if your mom had ended up with Buzz, you would have never been born.
 Or I would have been born Peter Aldrin.
 And I'd wait for a woman with the right stuff.
 Now, remember, in this scenario, I am a man, and my father is an astronaut.
 Well, Lemon, if you'd like to see what your mom's life would have been, I can arrange for you to meet Buzz.
 Are you serious? He's in town.
 I saw him last night at Rupert Murdoch's Twister party.
 I mean, uh, regular party.
 Tracy This Mother's Day thing is a disaster.
 I hear you.
 Because you're talking in the ear that I didn't lose a button in.
 I thought Verna and I had made this breakthrough.
 But now, we're just back to fighting about money and clothes.
 Thank God Terry's dead, or we'd be fighting over him again too.
 Boy, I thought I had it bad with my fake mom.
 Are you kidding? At least your fake mom has to act like she cares about you.
 Yeah, that's true.
 And she is a good actress.
 I bought those Pajamaralls.
 And you got to choose her.
 No, Jenna.
 No one gets to choose their mom.
 Even when they're fake.
 For good or bad, we're stuck with them.
 And you know what? They don't get to choose who we are, either.
 And God knows we're not perfect.
 It's true.
 Sometimes, I sing too beautifully.
 What a nice surpr Is there another woman? What? How did you Colleen.
 Don't blame your mother, Jack.
 This is about us.
 Oh, my God.
 Look, Avery, you know how I feel.
 So I'm going to skip the part where I deny anything.
 Then you skip the part where you yell at me.
 And then we both move on to the, uh, make-up sex.
 Wow, that is a swing.
 Look, I assumed you and I were exclusive.
 But we never talked about it.
 So maybe this is partly my fault.
 And I forgive you.
 Come here.
 I'm sorry, but these tactics have worked on stupider women.
 If we're going to move forward, you better figure out what it is you want.
 Soon.
 Excuse me, Dr.
 Aldrin.
 I'm sorry, there wasn't a door, so I just I don't believe in barriers, because I always break them.
 You must be Liz.
 Yes, sir.
 I actually came about my mother.
 Margaret Lemon? Well, you would have known her as Margaret Freeman? Maggie Freeman? Of course I remember her.
 Well, I'm sorry to bother you, but I can't help but wonder what my mom lost by giving up on you.
 Her perfect man.
 Perfect? Sure, I'm a famous astronaut, decorated fighter pilot, doctorate from M.
I.
T.
 But even I sometimes I see you.
 I see what you're doing.
 Return to the night.
 You have no business here.
 Are you yelling at the moon? I'm sorry, She and I just I get mad sometimes.
 Sure.
 Look, you want to know what your mother missed? Years of drinking, depression, cheating.
 I flipped over a Saab in the San Fernando Valley.
 I once woke up in the Air and Space Museum with a revolver in the waistband of my jean shorts.
 Oh, my God.
 But you're A human being.
 But I'm at peace now.
 Sober almost 32 years.
 But I would have put Maggie Freeman through hell.
 The moms were right.
 There's no such thing as Astronaut Mike Dexter.
 What am I doing? I'm sorry if I've disappointed you.
 Would you like to yell at the moon with Buzz Aldrin? Yes, please.
 I own you! You dumb moon! I walked on your face! Don't you know it's day? Idiot! Well, I'm ready for the show.
 Mom, you're wearing my outfit.
 Well, a mother makes sacrifices.
 Like those 16 hours I spent in labor even though it was Margarita Monday at Dockside Joe's.
 Daughters make sacrifices too.
 Wait, why are you wearing that? Who's paying you? No one.
 I'm wearing it for the same reason you're wearing mine.
 Because I love you.
 I love you too, baby girl.
 Why does your chest feel weird? Uh Because I love you so much.
 # Sincerely # # Oh, yes, sincerely # # 'Cause I love you so dearly # You look beautiful Mom.
 Thank you Son.
 I think I'm ready for the sex talk.
 # Sincerely # # Oh, you know how I love you # Mom? You were right to settle.
 I'm glad you married Dad.
 So am I, dear.
 Now would you please find yourself someone and start a family before my hereditary dementia sets in? Wait, what? # Please say you'll be mine # You What is wrong with you? I am 51 years old.
 Do you not think I can take care of my own personal life? Think? I know you can't.
 You do a lot of things well.
 Make money, choose wine, wear ties But you and women? Disaster.
 Divorce, broken engagements, I assume herpes And I wonder why I'm like that.
 Maybe it's because you can't let go of your precious Jackie, so you undermine me at every turn.
 I'm not going to be around forever.
 Don't pull that out, Colleen.
 And if I don't do something, you will never make a decision.
 You'll just frou-frou around with Nancy and Avery until they're both gone.
 And then, where will I be? I'll be circling the globe in my coffin rocket.
 Something I saw on T.
V.
 It's very expensive.
 I'm done disapproving, Jackie.
 I'm just trying to help.
 I need to know that someone is looking out for my little boy.
 All right, Colleen.
 Then, I'm asking you, for the first time in my life Tell me what to do.
 And I'm going to tell you, for the first time in my life I can't! I did not lose her, sir.
 Carl would never let you down.
 Carl that does not sound right.
 Kevin? No.
 Who am I? Is it Keith? No, that's not Yes, I'm Keith.
 That's our show! Thanks for watching! But before you go to bed, our moms are going to tuck you in with a special song.
 # Don't go to sleep # # with a frown in your pocket # # Take it to the yard and tie it to a rocket # # Shoot it to the moon, you'll feel better soon # # Don't go to bed with a frown # # Don't go to bed with a frown # Goodnight! Stay tuned for a special Mother's Day edition of Bitch Hunter.
   

                




                    			Jack Got a minute? Avery, of course.
 Are you okay? Oh, yeah, it's nothing.
 I was a guest on "Mad Money" last night.
 What's happening? Is one of you Jim Cramer? Okay, stop it.
 I didn't realize we were still airing that.
 Cramer's been dead for six months.
 Look, I know I'm supposed to go with you to Cerie's wedding this weekend.
 But I can't make it.
 Okay, I know you and I are in a period of detente right now because of my other Piece of tail? I was going to say, "romantic entanglements".
 But you do not want to miss this wedding.
 It's going to be New York royalty.
 The Astors, the Rockefellers, the Sbarros Yes, I know, Jack.
 You think I don't want to know what Pizzarina Sbarro is going to be wearing? Then come.
 We both know that is a bad idea.
 Which is why I scheduled a conflict for this weekend I can't get out of.
 What is it? Well, if you must know, I'm on Dodecacil, the pill where you only get your period once a year.
 We're so close to beating that thing completely.
 Yeah, well, my time has come.
 I'm going to a spa.
 Well, it's not really a spa.
 It's more of a fenced-in area in the Adirondacks.
 Fine, I'll go alone.
 And while I'm gone, do some thinking.
 About us.
 I promise you, this weekend will be filled with staring out windows while holding a glass of Scotch.
 That means a lot to me.
 Have a, uh, good time at your fenced-in area.
 And I'll see you in two weeks.
 What's that supposed to mean, you dumb douche? Oh, it's starting.
 I should go.
 "Aloha" means hello and goodbye.
 So, aloha.
 What? Hi, handsome.
 I didn't know you were coming to New York.
 I'm here to see my man.
 You're not busy this weekend, are you? Well, I am, actually.
 I have some thinking to do.
 Well, you can do your thinking.
 We'll just do it together on that tour boat that's painted like a shark.
 Hey, Liz.
 I need to know the name of the date you're bringing to my wedding.
 I'm coming alone, Cerie.
 But I would still like two meals.
 So is it okay if I sit you next to my dad's mistress' cousin? Whatever makes it easier for you.
 Awesome.
 God, three weddings in one day.
 I'm going to be in Spanx for 12 hours.
 My elastic line is going to get infected again.
 Are you really not bringing someone to Cerie's wedding? I don't care about having a date.
 What about Floyd's wedding? If I have to sit through that alone, I will rent a car, set it on fire, and drive it off a waterfall.
 I could set you up with my trainer.
 He's gay.
 But not when he's drunk.
 No, I don't need help, Jenna.
 I know where I'm going to find my date.
 Because I have already met him.
 What are you talking about? Jack's mom said to me that there's only a few different types of men in the world.
 And at my age, I have met all of them.
 So I'm going to go back through my gentleman Rolodex.
 Sexual time travel, just like my Cinemax softcore Emmanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land.
 I've dated plenty of good guys.
 My standards have just been too high.
 Yeah, they have.
 Meet me in the handicapped stall in 10 seconds.
 Liz Lemon.
 I was just thinking about you the other day.
 Really? Yeah, I saw this gorgeous woman putting glasses on her daughter's Mrs.
 Potato Head.
 The why is not important.
 Can we talk? Sure.
 Uh, I was just doing some baking.
 Can I get you something to drink? What goes good with second chances? Oh, water.
 I'd like water.
 So are you seeing anyone? Oh, this conversation.
 Uh, no, I'm still single.
 No one serious since you, actually.
 Well, that's good to hear.
 You know, when we broke up, it was because I felt like I was smarter than you.
 But that's so judgmental and and now, I just Oh, my God! What? Oh, my hooks.
 I'm just so comfortable with them that I Whoops.
 Oh, not again.
 That was my last ungashed painting.
 How did this happen? Oh, freak accident.
 You know I work with Doctors Without Borders.
 Well, I was helicoptering into Zimbabwe, when I thought I saw somebody that I knew.
 So I waved from the helicopter, which, it turns out, is a big no-no.
 And the rotor took my right hand clean off.
 And it turns out the person I was waving to was not my old football coach.
 Of course not.
 You were in Zimbabwe.
 Well, it looked just like a black version of him.
 What about the other hand? Oh, well, to celebrate my return from Africa, my cousin and I bought a bunch of fireworks.
 You know what? This was a bad idea.
 I should just go.
 What, you're too good for me now that I have pirate hook hands? It is absolutely not because you are disabled.
 I've been dumped by four different guys in wheelchairs.
 Look, I'll have you know, Liz, that I am in line for a hand transplant.
 There's this strangler who's about to be executed, and, uh, I've got my hooks crossed.
 Oh.
 Oh, my God.
 Drew, it's not about the hooks.
 It's how you got that way.
 You're just too dumb.
 Wait, Liz, don't go.
 Ow, it's hot.
 Yeah, of course it's hot.
 It's been in the oven.
 Now, who's the dumb one? Ugh.
 So handsome.
 Entourage meeting.
 I know which movie I'm doing this summer.
 Feline Groovy? It's a pun.
 Because cats' paws have grooves.
 And this is really what you want to spend your summer doing? It's perfect.
 I'm playing Garfield.
 My whole part's being shot on green screen in three days.
 And they're paying me exactly one million teachers' salaries.
 Tray, I think it's time you take a risk.
 Maybe do a dramatic role.
 Go for the "O" in your EGOT.
 What's this? Hard to Watch based on the book Stone Cold Bummer by Manipulate.
 It's about growing up in our old neighborhood.
 And it's real Oscar bait, sir.
 You say things like "You don't know my pain," and "You watch your mouth, Tyrese, and, in a less dramatic scene, "I'll have hash browns.
" Interesting.
 And I've got to win an Oscar somehow.
 It's either this or I submit that animated film I drew about the Holocaust.
 We should definitely do this.
 Nancy and Avery almost ran into each other at the elevator.
 Seriously? You rode the Shark boat? Was it scary? This whole thing is getting out of control.
 Yeah, you need to be honest with everyone.
 It's only fair that you tell Nancy about Avery.
 That is terrible advice.
 If I tell Nancy, it will just complicate things.
 I need to keep her at arm's length this weekend.
 I've prepared a very unromantic evening.
 First, we're going to see a documentary about female circumcision, and then we're going to eat too much Indian food.
 Okay, but you're just avoiding the problem.
 Sometimes, the right thing and the hard thing are the same thing.
 I read that on a teabag.
 If you want to be helpful, just give me some more advice on how to keep a date asexual.
 You know what? Sometimes, I think That's great.
 "You know what? Sometimes, I think" That's really annoying.
 I'm going to use that.
 You're the best.
 Honestly, though, sometimes, I Okay, I hear it.
 I read the script.
 And did you like it? I hated it.
 I couldn't relate.
 What? It's about growing up poor in the South Bronx.
 Moving from foster home to foster home.
 Seeing a pigeon fight a baby.
 All of that happened to you.
 I don't remember that kind of stuff.
 I mean, I remember being born, of course.
 I remember learning how to ride a bike.
 But that was last year.
 From '75 to '82, it's just a blur.
 Then you're repressing some stuff.
 That can happen.
 I remember the summer my Webelos group went camping, and we were taken by the Hill People.
 Next thing I knew, summer was over and it was time for back to school shopping.
 Tray, this is an important film.
 Oh, brother.
 If you want to get your "O", you've got to reconnect with your roots.
 No, I don't.
 I was on a yacht with the Roots last week.
 Dude.
 Hello, Dennis.
 Hey, dummy.
 You know, as soon as my beeper went off, I knew it was you.
 I've got a personalized vibration for each chick I used to put it to.
 Mm.
 Thanks for meeting me at my workplace.
 What exactly are you building here? Hey, Liz.
 Do you want to be a millionaire, hm? Mr.
 Dennis? No, no, no, Jose.
 Only babies out here.
 Don't you want to be a big boy? Ow! Who's that kid? That's Jose.
 I met him through this program that places troubled adults with child mentors.
 Wait, are you planning to "balloon boy" him? Liz, listen to me.
 What was the one mistake those people in Denver made? One mistake? Yeah, there was no kid in the balloon.
 When Jose jumps out of there or whatever, people are going to go nuts.
 Oh, my God.
 Go.
 What are you doing? Run.
 Unbelievable.
 These are the men in my life.
 What did I do wrong? Well, the first thing you did wrong was you touched the balloon.
 This is a scientific facility, Liz.
 This is a public park named after Ron Artest.
 Yah, and like Jose, Ron dreamed of glory.
 Hey, Liz.
 You'll be back! Hey, what's going on, huh? What's your deal? Lesbian.
 How was your dinner? Mm I'm stuffed.
 That place was good.
 Way better than the Indian joint I go to in Boston.
 O'Doyle's.
 Uh you know what I like after too much curry? A warm glass of milk and some John Phillip Sousa marches.
 Okay, I'm going to go to the restroom before I head back to the hotel.
 Oh, okay.
 I'll order you a car.
 Mm.
 Uh, yes, I'd like to order a car, please.
 Account number 5-4-1-3-9 I'm going to have to call you back.
 Oh, Jack! I've been through every guy.
 There's no one left.
 Come on, you sound like me at the Olympic Village.
 Ugh, who cares? So I go to Floyd's wedding alone.
 Maybe I'll just lean into it and bring a cat in a baby stroller.
 Come on, you still have tonight.
 Liz, I want you to meet the guy that you're going to be sitting next to tomorrow.
 He's told me his name, like, a million times, but I keep forgetting it.
 It's Wesley.
 No! I knew you'd be back.
 No, I'm not back, Wesley.
 Oh, of course.
 Because you said you could find someone better than me.
 Mm-hmm.
 Well, where is he? Stop doing that.
 You look idiotic.
 Of course I do.
 Excellent pantomime is supposed to look idiotic.
 Okay, I may be alone tonight, but I'm not done looking.
 Liz, I'm going to guess that the last two months have been a lot of singles' events in gymnasia.
 And, uh oh, don't tell me.
 You revisited old boyfriends, didn't you? That's never worked.
 Oh, my God.
 I hate you.
 Yeah, but that's it, isn't it? The only thing wrong with me is that you hate me.
 So with that as my only defect, where do I rank with all the other men that you've been with? Okay, I have another wedding tomorrow.
 It's my ex-boyfriend, Floyd.
 Will you come with me? And then there was Wesley.
 God, I hate you.
 Well, good morning.
 I'm glad we did this, Jack.
 It was a huge step.
 But it feels right.
 "Huge" seems like the wrong word.
 I mean, sex is not that big a deal, right? How can something that animals do be a big deal? Worms can do it with any other worm.
 Well, it's a big deal for me.
 Besides my ex-husband, you're the only other man I've slept with.
 Two men? That can't be true.
 Well, uh, look, Jack.
 There's something I have to tell you.
 I did something bad.
 After my divorce, I went out with my girlfriends, and I danced with a guy.
 That's it? Also, it was after midnight on a Saturday.
 So technically, it was a Sunday.
 A man had his hands on my hips on a day that was set aside for the Lord.
 There, I said it.
 Man, Catholic guilt.
 Am I right? Those nuns really messed me up.
 Not me.
 What are we doing here? You told me we were going someplace boring.
 This is an awesome copy shop.
 Well, this copy shop is on the corner of 157th Street and Lieutenant Uhura Avenue.
 That's where I grew up.
 Obviously, your building is gone.
 I guess someone didn't come up here to scout the location first.
 Because someone else didn't sign off on the transportation budget.
 I never check that Earthlink account.
 My God.
 Nothing's changed at all.
 It's changed completely, Tray.
 What is wrong with you? We brought you up here to jog your memory.
 But I guess that was a waste of time.
 Because someone came up with this stupid idea in the first place.
 Let's just go.
 Why do I recognize that stairwell? It's all coming back to me.
 Oh, my God! I slept on an old dog bed stuffed with wigs.
 I watched a prostitute stab a clown.
 Our basketball hoop was a ribcage.
 A ribcage! Why did you bring me here? I blocked all this stuff out for a reason.
 Oh, Lord! Some guy with dreads electrocuted my fish! Tray, use this pain to get your Oscar.
 I hate pain! I'm doing Garfield Three! And as soon as I make some copies of my passport, I'm never coming back here! Move! Lemon, I don't have time to talk about what you look like right now That's how urgent this is.
 I need you to not put on your judgmental face when I tell you the following.
 I slept with Nancy.
 Fight it off, Lemon.
 Oh, what were you thinking? I wasn't thinking at all.
 She put on red underwear.
 You would think it would clash with her hair.
 But it didn't.
 You have made this so much worse.
 Sex always makes things worse.
 This isn't fair to Nancy.
 You have to tell her about Avery.
 I know, but Nancy's not Avery.
 Avery is cool, collected, descended from Swedish valley people.
 Nancy is a fiery, Irish nut job, descended from bog people Well, I'm sorry, Jack, but I have got to go give a reading at the wedding of the only normal guy I've ever dated.
 And I have to be at St.
 Paul's in 20 minutes.
 Wait, Floyd's wedding is at a Catholic church? Are they having a Mass? Yeah, Kaitlin's Catholic.
 He converted for her.
 Meanwhile, when we were dating, and I wanted to check out that Unitarian church Good talk, Lemon.
 Mm-hmm.
 Thanks for holding my purse.
 See how we help each other? I accompany you to Floyd's wedding.
 I hold your purse.
 This was meant to be.
 We're like Russ and Rebecca on Chums.
 This is just a date, Wesley.
 You know that's not true.
 I wouldn't be here if there was anybody else.
 I'm your best option.
 And you're mine.
 You see, I, uh I lost my job two days ago, and am now facing a little residency issue.
 What? I don't want to go back to England.
 I can't suffer through the London Olympics.
 We're not prepared, Liz.
 Did you see the Beijing opening ceremonies? We don't have control over our people like that.
 I'm supposed to be up front for my reading.
 This is just a date.
 Right.
 And maybe up there, you'll fall in love with a handsome groomsman.
 But until then, Rebecca # I'll be here always # # While the rains fall on whales # Chums.
 Garfield effects test.
 Take one.
 And Act! Nermal, I hate you, Nermal! Almost as much as I hate Mondays! This is my lasagna! You hear me, Nermal? My lasagna! Okay, let's cut.
 Okay, maybe a little less intense.
 You know, you're Garfield.
 You're a cat who likes sleeping and lasagna.
 Well, I'm sorry, Shawn.
 And child actor whose name I can't remember.
 You haven't walked in my shoes.
 All my life, I've tried to forget the things I've seen.
 A crack-head breastfeeding a rat.
 A homeless man cooking a Hot Pocket on the third rail of the G train.
 The G train, Nermal! There is something inside of me that needs to come out.
 Feline Groovy can't tell my story, then I will win my Oscar elsewhere.
 Or I'll die trying.
 Okay, so are you not doing this movie? Because that suit was made special! For your weird body! Are you doing a reading too? I'm Mike, I'm friends with Floyd.
 Hi.
 Excuse me, do you have a job? And are you here with someone? Uh, I'm a lawyer.
 And I'm single.
 Okay, friend, here's the deal.
 My name is Liz.
 I almost got 1200 on my S.
A.
T.
s.
 And I need a date for this wedding.
 And I like your head shape.
 What do you say? I'd love to be your date, Liz.
 Okay.
 I like how forward you are.
 Now may I tell you something? I'm a plushie.
 Is that a fraternity? Kind of.
 It means I belong to a group of like-minded people who dress up in mascot costumes.
 Okay.
 And have orgies in hotel rooms and state parks.
 There it is.
 Our term for intercourse is "yiffing".
 Would you excuse me, please? Okay, fine.
 Let's get married.
 Oh, yeah.
 And now a reading from Corinthians.
 "Love is patient.
 Love is kind.
 It is not jealous.
 It is not pompous.
 It does not envy.
 It does not boast.
 It is not proud.
 It is not rude.
" Nothing like being in church, having spent the night doing a bunch of bad crap.
 Am I right? Yes.
 Uh Speaking of which, I'm seeing someone else, and I think I'm in love with both of you.
 You lying bastard.
 After last night? Nancy, just let me explain.
 No, I am out of here.
 You can't leave, Donovan.
 We're in the middle of Mass.
 You and I both know you have to stay until the final blessing.
 So let's talk.
 No, I'm not saying a word to you.
 The second this Mass is over, I'm on the first train back to Boston.
 And you'll never see me again.
 "And as for knowledge, it will pass away.
" Stall? And now an unscheduled reading that I think is appropriate for this lovely, romantic occasion.
 "But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his.
 So whenever he lay with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground.
" Sorry.
 "Then, Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin.
" Oh come on, Bible.
 Help a lady out.
 "For he has sold us, and he has indeed devoured our money.
" I seen a blind guy bite a police horse! A puppy committed suicide after he saw our bathroom! I once bit into a Merino and there was a child's shoe in it! I seen a hooker eat a tire! A pack of wild dogs took over and successfully ran a Wendy's! The sewer people stole my skateboard! The projects I lived in was named after Zachary Taylor, generally considered to be one of the worst presidents of all time! I once saw a baby give another baby a tattoo! They were very drunk!   

                




                    			Previously on 30 Rock So you're In three weddings on the same day, yeah.
 Fate is telling us we're each other's settling soul mates.
 I've been seeing someone else.
 And I think I'm in love with both of you.
 Jack wants me to stall? So I'm gonna to marry Yafet.
 And we're going to live in Nineva.
 And I'm going to be a prostitute.
 Okay, what else? What else? Yes, I continued to see other people.
 No, not people, one person.
 Who, apparently, you're also in love with.
 It's possible.
 Haven't you ever read Archie comics? Jack, I got divorced.
 I didn't know if you would ever leave Mark.
 So I let myself fall into something else.
 Fall into something else? That's just a fancy way of saying you're biting the hot dog at both ends.
 You look amazing in that dress.
 You look like a gay mortician in that suit.
 You wanted to see me, Mr.
 Hornberger? Yes, you know, Kenneth, I have a thankless job.
 For example, I'm here on a Saturday to show around some KableTown folks.
 It's not real.
 Point is, I usually only get to deliver bad news.
 But not today.
 Kenneth, you are the new Junior In-Charge Boy of the entire N.

C.

 Oh, my goodness! This is my dream come true! And to hear it from my best friend in the whole world, comma, Bald Category.
 Well, you start in two weeks.
 And they'll give you some moving money to help you get to L.
A.
 California? But that's where they shoot filthy movies, like The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants, which encourages women to wear pants.
 I can't move out there and be away from all of you.
 No thank you, sir, I'll pass.
 You can't pass.
 Jack put you up for this.
 If you don't want the job, you have to talk to him.
 Fine, I will talk to him.
 And Mr.
 Donaghy will understand, because he's my best friend in the whole world, comma, Beautiful Hair Category, parentheses, Strong.
 # And a man must leave his mother # # And a woman needs her bones # What can I say, Nancy? I want to be with you.
 I want to take naps with you.
 I want to watch you watch a hockey game.
 I want to find long, red hairs in my overcooked pot roast.
 I love you.
 I do love you.
 Because you know that what I really am is a poor mama's boy from "Sadchester", Massachusetts, who had to wear his sister's hand-me-down corduroys.
 They were orange and had hearts for pockets.
 And you like me, anyway.
 Yeah, I get it, Jack.
 But what are you going to do about it? I can't share you with another woman like you're that Mormon guy on H.
B.
O.
 Who was in that tornado movie.
 You know, the one with the girl with the forehead who was married to the Jewish guy.
 What? I'm a mom, give me a break.
 I need to know right now.
 Are you in or are you out? In.
 Nancy, I'm in.
 Okay.
 Then I'm in too.
 # Sum of all his parts # # There is love # # Floyd and Katelyn # # There is love.
 # Paul? What are you doing? I thought you were going to get your hair done for your friend's wedding.
 I was, but I forgot my bag of hair.
 Is this who you're into now? Cher? You're being another woman behind my back? It's not what it looks like.
 Oh, spare me your lame excuses.
 Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but when a girl dates a straight man who impersonates her on stage for mostly gay audiences, she has certain expectations.
 Fidelity, Paul.
 It's not just the name of a bank that sued me.
 But I love you both equally.
 I don't know what to tell you.
 But you have to choose.
 It's her or me.
 Jenna, babe, wait.
 I'm sorry.
 That came out wrong.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 So maybe you should skip the reception.
 Definitely.
 I mean, everybody's already seen me do the Electric Slide.
 That was a low point.
 Feel free to hate me.
 No, no, no, you get a free pass, Liz Lemon.
 And not just because without you, I never would have met Katelyn.
 Oh, boy, not fate again.
 I'm just gonna go.
 Wait, no, do you not want to hear the story? Fine, but this counts as my gift to you.
 So after we broke up, I was living alone in Cleveland, depressed, and thanks to you, addicted to Cheesy Blasters.
 It's the nicotine in them.
 So one night I'm out, stocking up on my Blasters, and Katelyn stops me to give me a lecture about how bad they are for you.
 Three months later, she moved in.
 Yeah, well, I guess fate is looking out for both of us, because a tooth rotted in my mouth and brought me to that guy.
 Oh, God, I hope he's got a bike out there.
 Are you ready, my fiancee? Yes, just stay over there.
 Congratulations.
 Mr.
 Donaghy? God, Kenneth.
 I need to talk to you about an urgent, page-related matter.
 He came out of nowhere.
 We can talk on Monday.
 Ms.
 Donovan and I have an hour between weddings to, uh Tickle each other like Teletubbies.
 That's how I used to explain it to my kids when they walked in on us.
 But I don't want my promotion, sir.
 I want to stay here in New York with all my friends.
 By "all your friends," are you mostly talking about me, Liz Lemon and the janitor? The janitor thinks we're friends? I'm not going to let you say no, Kenneth.
 This is a promotion for you.
 And yes, it's difficult.
 But today is about pulling triggers.
 It's about making bold choices.
 It's about Two Spidermans fighting, and sometimes they make weird noises.
 But they're not hurting each other.
 How often did they walk in on you? A lot.
 If you'll excuse me.
 Oh, bother! Treble bother! What is it? My fancy dress slippers.
 I left them in my office.
 So go get them and meet me at Cerie's wedding.
 No, when I was fired, I vowed on the Snipes name I would never set foot in there again.
 Also, Kevin in Security has a picture of me.
 So what, you want me to go get your tuxedo shoes? See, our minds are already one, as our bodies soon shall be.
 There's the address.
 Of course, you work in insurance.
 Specializing in the transportation industry.
 It fulfills my boyhood passion for train accidents.
 Fine, I'll go get your shoes.
 Farewell, my luscious plum.
 Oh, son of a bitch.
 Why is your face like that? Why the long face, Barbie's boyfriend? They want me to get a promotion, but I don't wanna move to Los Angeles.
 California? No way, Ken.
 If you leave, who will compliment my tuxedo? I'm sorry, sir.
 You look great.
 It's exactly what I picture you wearing in heaven.
 In two years.
 Thank you.
 Now look, you've got to tank this promotion.
 Do a sloppy job, and they'll leave you alone.
 That's how I got out of doing foreplay with Angie.
 And my taxes.
 But that's not in my nature.
 If you've learned anything from me, it's how to do a bad job.
 Go, honor me.
 Save yourself.
 But first, get me a sandwich.
 Get it yourself, Chubbs.
 I'm on a coffee break.
 That's my boy.
 Oh, I'm going to hit the ladies' room real quick.
 You can never tell when one of these non-denominational, goof-around weddings is going to start.
 Jack Donaghy.
 Paul L'Astname.
 I'm Jenna's boyfriend.
 Oh, I've heard a lot about you, Paul.
 Well, it's all true.
 I'm a native of Houston and I love to cook healthy.
 And the female impersonator stuff.
 Oh, sure, of course.
 That's actually been causing some problems at home lately.
 Do you think it's possible to love two women at once? I know it's possible.
 But at some point, you have to choose, Paul.
 You can't delude yourself with thoughts like, "Maybe they'd be into a group marriage," or "What if I could somehow combine them into one perfect woman, like a s'more you could take a shower with?" But how do you know if you've made the right decision? You don't.
 You'll always be wondering what your life would have been like if you'd opened that other door.
 Like at a haunted house sex party.
 Exactly.
 Life is about taking control, not being afraid, and never looking back.
 Like if a Frankenstein's behind you at the sex party.
 Thank you, Jack.
 Come on, Jessup, get it together.
 No tears! Everything all right in there? Look, if you're the bride, you gotta go through with it.
 The shrimp alone must have cost a thou.
 I'm fine.
 Thank you.
 Here, you need this more than I do.
 I never put my mouth on it.
 Thanks.
 You look so familiar to me.
 Oh, I'm a financial reporter for C.
N.

 "The Hot Box with Avery Jessup"? No, you ever do a commercial for Overshop.
 Com? Oh, god, I did.
 Oh, that was before I got rid of my Maryland accent.
 Does the "O" have it? Oh, we do.
 Do you "O"? Oh, no.
 Let go.
 "O".
 Ugh, that accent's idiotic.
 Anyway, nice to meet you, Avery Jessup.
 I'm Nancy.
 Hi, I'm not normally this, uh overwhelmed.
 I came here to talk to my boyfriend.
 Or whatever he is.
 I mean, this whole situation is Clamp down, Jessup! Be a winner! Oh, my God.
 I can't drink this.
 You want to talk about it? Yes, but first, can you hold my hair while I I'm helping the Overshop.
com lady puke.
 This is a classy wedding.
 Oh, tuxedo slippers.
 You freak.
 Excuse me, I'm supposed to meet you here? Huh? Are you Wesley? I'm Carol.
 I'm sorry, what's happening now? I'm supposed to meet a Wesley about my insurance claim? Wesley doesn't work here anymore.
 Are you serious? I mean, I made the appointment, like, a month ago.
 I rearranged my whole Saturday.
 Are you a doorman? Yeah, I'm a doorman.
 To the sky.
 I'm a pilot.
 Oh, okay.
 Well, look, it's a pretty standard workman's comp claim.
 I'm sure you could handle it.
 I was flying the 7:00 A.
M.
 From Tampa to Louisville, and we had a two-hour weather delay.
 So naturally, all the passengers got drunk.
 Generally speaking, if there's a delay of more than 20 minutes, I might as well be driving a party bus.
 It's just idiocy.
 I don't know what's going on in this country.
 I know, people wear flip-flops to church.
 And the N.
B.
A.
 Tattoo situation is out of control.
 Thank you.
 Anyway, we're about a half hour into the flight.
 I hear this commotion behind me in the cabin.
 So I exit the cockpit, I go down the aisle, and to my left, I see A terrorist? No, I wish.
 No, it's a drunk lady.
 She's pulled her pants off.
 And she's ranting.
 She's complaining about the in-flight entertainment.
 So things got a little heated, and, uh I had to implement Sky Law.
 What's Sky Law.
 It's when I put on the "Fasten Seat Belt" sign and no one's allowed to move until we've had 10 minutes of silence.
 Well, I made the whole thing up, but, you know, people are stupid, so they don't question it.
 That is awesome.
 So what is the workman's comp part of this? Eventually, I flipped the drunk lady off.
 She bit my finger.
 I know, it's totally unprofessional.
 But she was bagging pretty hard on my T.
G.
 S.
 What? T.
G.
S.
, it's this late-night show on N.
B.
C.
 We run it in-flight when we're northwest bound.
 Basically the greatest thing ever on television.
 I don't stand for anybody besmirching it on my aircraft.
 Do you believe in fate? Wait a minute, are you kidding me? You write for T.
G.
 S.
 With Tracy Jordan? I'm the head writer.
 I'm not an insurance claims adjuster.
 I'm just here because my cousin Well, I mean, it's my favorite show ever.
 I'm sure you get hear all the time.
 Literally, not once ever.
 There's this one Fart Doctor sketch where Fart Doctor is trying to figure out who farted in the spelling bee, and he's like "He who spelt it, dealt it.
" I wrote that.
 I write all the Fart Doctors.
 I can't believe this.
 Would you like to go to a rich girl's wedding with me? I don't know.
 Does that sound like more fun than me eating alone at the LaGuardia Chili's? I won't leave you, sir.
 No matter what it takes.
 Good afternoon and welcome.
 Not.
 We begin our stupid tour of this once-great network outside Studio 6-H.
 Uh-oh.
 Ring, ring.
 Hmm.
 What's up? Nothing.
 Just giving a dumb tour to a bunch of uggos.
 Let's meet up later and smoke some drug cigarettes.
 So you're a pilot, huh? Did you serve? Air Force.
 I flew the C-76 out of Ramstein.
 It's designed to fly in close proximity to the fighter jets and photograph them for recruiting brochures.
 I should pick your brain.
 I'm developing a daytime talk show with Sully Sullenberger.
 Yeah, I've met that guy.
 He's not that great.
 You know what a great pilot would have done? Not hit the birds.
 That's what I do every day.
 Not hit birds.
 Where's my ticket to the Grammys? Hey, what took you so long in the bathroom? Ah, the usual ladies' room nonsense.
 A girl with boyfriend trouble, someone forgot tampons, everybody was bad at science and math.
 You know the drill.
 The ceremony will be starting soon.
 Ah, I'll get our table number.
 You get us as many drinks as you can carry.
 I'll see you at the reception, Liz.
 Jack.
 Carol.
 Get ready for some of this.
 Later.
 He's here with you? Indeed, he is.
 I see that Nancy's still here.
 You're welcome.
 A smug, 40-year-old bridesmaid.
 What a treat for everyone.
 Yes, Lemon, I am with Nancy now.
 What made up your mind? Well, I decided that any decision was better than no decision at all.
 Huh, I don't know, Jack.
 I used to feel that way too.
 But now, I know you can't force your fate.
 You just have to let it wash over you.
 Like a spray tan that won't take because your skin is too oily.
 That's absurd, Lemon.
 The world is made by those who control their own destiny.
 It isn't made by those who don't do, it's made by those who do do.
 Which is what made me the man I am.
 I do do.
 Yeah.
 Grow up, Lemon.
 The point is, I've made my choice, and I'm not looking back, period.
 Period.
 Avery Jessup? Son of a What did you do on your tour today? Those were the KableTown executives.
 Our new bosses.
 Sir, I was just trying to do a bad job, so I wouldn't have to go to Los Angeles.
 Everyone there smiles creepily all the time, and that's sort of my thing.
 Kenneth, you're not going to Los Angeles.
 Because they're making me fire you.
 You're fired.
 Ready? Here, this is yours.
 Oh, Nancy, I'm sorry.
 This is an embarrassing oversight.
 Jack, this morning in church, you told me all the reasons that you love me, some more graphic than were appropriate for the setting.
 Now I want you to tell me what's so special about this other woman.
 Well, I like how she's less hot than you? I'm serious.
 What can I say? She's smart, she's pretty.
 She can tell you the Dow 40 in order of market cap.
 She knows how to field dress a deer.
 Why do you Go on.
 Okay, her laugh.
 It's like music.
 Really mean music.
 And she always wears high heels, because, according to her, flat shoes are for quitters.
 For God's sakes, what can I say? You'd like her, Nancy.
 She's tough, she's loyal, she was once on the cover of Cigar Aficionado magazine wearing just a tie and some smoke.
 She's great.
 So you weren't lying when you said you were in love with two women.
 No, I wasn't lying.
 Good, then I feel a lot better about leaving.
 What? Avery's here, Jack.
 And she's pregnant.
 Oh, my God.
 Yeah, I know what you're going to do, Jack.
 And it's a lot better than that dumb, Irish Catholic, "I knocked up a Portugese girl, and now we gotta get married, and our kid's gonna grow up to be a dirty state cop," kind of thing.
 This is crazy.
 Nah, it's fate.
 You're supposed to be a dad.
 By the way, when I blew your mind last night I was giving it about 50 percent.
 Unhand my fiancee! No, no, he's just a groomsman.
 And a Somali pirate.
 Careful.
 You try to end our engagement with a textual transmission? And then leave me in the lurch without tuxedo slippers? Your behavior as a fiancee has been as weak as American tea.
 There, I've said it.
 Our first argument, everyone.
 You're engaged? What if the bachelorette party theme was "sluts"? No, the engagement is off.
 You keep talking about how fate is trying to push us together.
 You know what? It is.
 But not to meet you.
 To meet the right man.
 His name is Carol.
 Like Carroll O'Connor.
 From Nick at Nite.
 Exactly, Cerie, thank you.
 Carol is the one that I was fated to meet.
 And yeah, I've only known him for a few hours, and maybe this sounds crazy.
 But I already feel like I could spend the rest of my life with him.
 He's the one that I've been waiting for.
 And someday, when Carol sees my disgusting foot secret, he's going to be okay with it.
 I can tell.
 You were wrong, Wesley.
 We don't have to settle.
 The moms were wrong.
 Stupid Buzz Aldrin was wrong.
 So thank you and goodbye.
 Praise to the universe! Love is real! Fine, it's your loss.
 There's only one Wesley Snipes in this world.
 You know there isn't.
 Ugh.
 I was going to ask you if you wanted me to hold your bag.
 How much of that did you hear? Well, you were engaged.
 You apparently hate Buzz Aldrin.
 Foot problem.
 And you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives together.
 I see.
 I'm sure you could get a cab on Houston.
 Yeah, I'm going to depart.
 On time.
 I'm a pilot.
 Jack.
 Carol.
 # In your eyes # # In your eyes # # There is a light in your eyes # # In your eyes # Could you turn that down, please? Mazel tov.
 I'm trying to tell you I want to get married.
 Oh, for God's sakes, Jack.
 What do you think? You're just going to sweep me off my feet? This pregnancy is two years ahead of schedule.
 I'm suing Dodecacil.
 I'm suing you.
 I'm suing this baby.
 You can't control everything, Avery.
 Sometimes, it's just fate.
 Ugh, is there gay juice in the champagne? See, I want you to teach our child how to say awesome stuff like that.
 I would be a kick-ass mom.
 But if this is just you trying to do the right thing No, I want this.
 Sure, I thought it would happen later in life and that you would be Anne Hathaway's granddaughter, but I've always wanted this.
 But maybe it's too hard.
 The career, motherhood Keeping it tight to stay camera-ready for breaking news.
 I mean, sure, Soledad O'Brien does it, but I wipe the floor with that bitch.
 Let's do this.
 Love is patient, Love is weird, and sometimes gross.
 Love is elusive.
 And you have found it.
 So treasure it.
 To Grizz and Feyonce.
 On behalf of Grizz and Feyonce, I'd like to thank Jack Donaghy for letting us have this reception here after the other location couldn't support the weight of Grizz's extended family.
 Now let's make like an Arnold Palmer and party.
 Naturally, I blew it.
 Now, I'm alone in a dashiki.
 I wonder what that Somali pirate's deal is? I could live on a boat.
 I don't even know where Paul went.
 I guess he made his choice.
 You know what? Forget men.
 We've got each other.
 Yeah, let's go lez.
 No, I meant, like, a book club or something, jeez.
 Right, sisterhood.
 That's something we can count on.
 I'll never is that Paul? You have a lot of taped-up balls to come here dressed like that.
 Oh, my God.
 If this is going to work, Jenna, it can't just be all about you.
 But No buts.
 I'm the man here, and you're going to respect me.
 Yes, shma'am.
 Lemon, you know that's a young boy's puberty dashiki.
 Wrong, Jack, it's a warlord's concubine dashiki.
 Avery, you're here.
 I'm not surprised.
 Why should I be? And I'm pregnant.
 Also not shocking me.
 Reacting appropriately.
 Lemon, I think your pilot friend is looking for you.
 So? I thought he was gone forever.
 I guess I should go talk to him.
 Carol, what are you doing here? How did you get past security? If you walk briskly in a pilot's uniform, you can go pretty much anywhere.
 I've been upstairs at the White House while the Obamas were sleeping.
 I thought you had a flight.
 Yeah, I do.
 But those dirtbags can wait on the runway a couple more hours.
 I hate people too.
 Look, I'm 39 years old.
 I'm single.
 And, lately, I've been thinking there's a reason for that.
 I keep expecting people to be perfect.
 But nobody's perfect.
 Yes, exactly.
 So if the worst thing about you is that you give crazy speeches to fiances and maybe have some kind of foot thing That was a joke, I have medicine for it.
 Why don't we give this a shot? As long as you're not Jewish.
 I'm totally kidding.
 Yes, let's do this.
 And honestly, Carol, I am a very normal person.
 Not a good time, guys.
 Liz Cher, me, Paul, and I want to thank you for being a part of our lives.
 And for encouraging us to be like this.
 I can't believe I'm meeting one and a half Jenna Maroneys right now.
 Hi.
 Hi, there Carol.
 Carol, that's a girl's name.
 It's a family name.
 Hey, everybody.
 I got fired today.
 You won't have Kenneth Ellen Parcell to kick around anymore.
 So I want to tell you people what I really think of you.
 This ain't the No, no! For four long years, I have listened to you all complain about your East Coast Media Elite problems.
 Your apartment renovations and your overpriced Star Wars memorabilia.
 That doorman is hammered.
 I have watched you throw away better food than my family eats at Christmas.
 And I have loved it.
 You people You are my best friends.
 And I hope you get everything you want in life.
 Kenneth? So kiss my face! That was actually really sweet.
 I'll see you all in heaven! Have a wonderful summer.
 # Joyful, joyful, you better be joyful # # Joy every day, oh, every day # # Open, open that door to heaven # # Heaven # # Oh, happy day # # Oh, Lord, bring me out of darkness # # The shadows have faded away # # We all will go up to heaven # # Oh, happy day # # Happy day # # Oh, happy and joyful heaven at 30 Rock #   

                




                    			No, Tom Jones! No! Lemon, it's Jack.
 Who Jackie? Oh, Lemon.
 Avery and I just got back from the most amazing vacation on Paul Allen's yacht.
 And for four glorious weeks, my naturally blonde lady love and I basked in the 3 S's surf, sun, and Sandwiches? We didn't need sandwiches, Lemon.
 It was so warm, you could pick fully-cooked lobsters out of the water.
 Sheer bliss.
 Avery is the most perfect woman ever created like a young Bo Derek stuffed with a Barry Goldwater.
 You sound weird.
 Do you have a beard? Not for long.
 It's back to reality.
 No more making love on the beach surrounded by a privacy circle of English-trained butlers But I've got to get out of island mode and back into work mode.
 How was your summer? Get this My gynecologist committed suicide.
 And I'm back.
 Carol! Hey, Lizzie.
 I'm about to take off.
 I'm in Lambert, Saint Louis, and I can see the arch from here.
 No, wait.
 Actually, that's a half burned-down McDonalds.
 Oh.
 Now, anyway, the weather's great, and I just have to go Saint Louis Newark, Newark Atlantic City, Atlantic City to Newark, and then I'll be there.
 Who flies Newark to Atlantic City? Black bachelorette parties.
 Gotta go.
 Hello? Yo.
 I'm calling to say that I'm giving you 110% this year.
 I'm relaxed, I'm focused, and I'm gonna be churning out the good stuff like you've never seen.
 That's great, Tracy.
 Oh, I misdialed.
 I thought I was calling my nutritionist.
 Good-bye.
 Okay.
 Season 5, here we go.
 What about office supplies? Can you come down 5% there? I'll try.
 We're already printing all of our internal memos on the back of my kid's art.
 In order for this merger to stay attractive to our friends at KableTown, we have to seem like a sexy, profitable company, and we're almost pulling it off.
 The Harry Potter theme park is a huge hit with both Anglophiles and pedophiles.
 The movie division has a James Cameron movie the whole world will see whether they like it or not.
 Only NBC continues to be the engorged whitehead on the otherwise flawless face of Universal Media.
 Lemon, why are you spending so much money on wigs? Tracy's head size keeps changing.
 Hang on.
 What is this pay increase for Jenna? Oh, boy.
 Look, as we enter the 5th season of TGS And remember, no one ever thought we'd make it this far I believed in us.
 And that was actually an oversight.
 Jenna has some crazy stuff built into her contract that kicks in now.
 Like what? Eye contact.
 Everyone must make eye contact with Miss Maroney at all times.
 She also gets a producer credit.
 What? Oh, it's just a vanity credit, Lemon.
 A low-cost way to make someone feel more important.
 Like executive producer Ashton Kutcher or Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
 Am I late for the producer's meeting? Eye contact.
 Thank you.
 Hey, K-K-K-K! First day back's gonna be a busy one.
 First, I need you to go to the drycleaners for me and find out how Martinizing works.
 I've always been curious.
 Then I need you to be back by noon to make the bathroom smell like sandalwood before I wreck it.
 You got that, K-packs of gum? I'm not Kenneth, sir.
 My name's Brian.
 Kenneth got fired at the end of last season.
 Of course.
 I knew that.
 Good meeting.
 So, how are things with Carol? Good.
 Did you know that if you're a pilot, that Chili's will seat you right away even if the pilot's dinner companion has just been yelling at the hostess? You are the Jackie O of our time.
 And pilots get all these travel points at Starwind hotels.
 The one in midtown has free internet.
 He doesn't stay with you when he's here? Why would he? Those Starwinds are nice.
 I mean, the bathtubs are so much cleaner than at home.
 I don't know how they do it.
 They clean them.
 You are not in a real relationship, Lemon.
 I hate that word, "relationship".
 It's almost as bad as "climax".
 You can't just do the vacation part.
 At some point you have to go home to the same house, unpack your dirty laundry, and have a life together.
 Then one of you says, "We should redecorate," and the other one says, "Please, Avery, I'm using the commode right now.
" Oh, she wants to redecorate? She just moved in.
 Avery has opinions.
 I love her for that.
 Unfortunately, she wants to repaint the upstairs hallway in a strie faux finish called Husk.
 I prefer the color that's already there A reddish brown shade called Elk Tongue.
 So tell her no.
 It's your house.
 This is how I know you've never had an adult relationship.
 If I say no, then I will be required to say yes to something else in the future, and the stakes in the future might be higher.
 Then say yes.
 If I give in, then I'm no longer the Alpha in my house.
 Before you know it, she'll have me wearing jeans and reading fiction.
 Yeah, well, yes and no are kind of your only two choices.
 For most men, sure.
 But there is a third option The Fabian strategy.
 I know this.
 If an apple and a feather fall at the same time The Fabian strategy derives its name from the Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus.
 He ran away, Lemon.
 Rather than engage in battle, he would retreat and retreat until the enemy grew fatigued and eventually made a mistake.
 Although I abhor it as a military strategy, it is the basis for all of my personal relationships.
 So Avery is your enemy.
 That sounds healthy.
 You're in no position to judge.
 Meeting someone in a hotel room twice a month is not a relationship, just ask any hooker.
 Stop staying "relationship".
 I'm sorry.
 I was going to say "climax".
 A line item budget! I love this! It takes people and turns them into amounts of money.
 Except for Tracy, I'm the most person on the show.
 What do we do now? Oh, okay.
 Well, Jack wants me to keep the budget flat, but I don't want to deny people their raises.
 You should fire Grace from wardrobe.
 She doesn't do anything.
 Fire Grace? Come on, you'd have to be a heartless monster to I'll do it.
 Grace, your position has been terminated.
 Effective immediately.
 But I've been here since the Jack Parr Show! Your health insurance will remain in effect until the end of this sentence.
 Come on.
 Chop-chop.
 What a shit job.
 Kenneth! I knew you'd come back! Let me smell your head.
 Oh, come on! This is a woman's blazer from a very expensive blazer shop called Rico's.
 I'm sorry, but my heart is playing tricks on my eyes, just like my kidneys did to my lungs that time.
 Are you okay? I keep hallucinating Kenneth.
 Am I going crazy again? Should I get my rainbow wig out of storage? No, Tracy, it's normal.
 Kenneth was very special to you, and now he's gone.
 The next time you hallucinate, just tell yourself, "This is not real.
 I am in control of this.
" Like the World Cup.
 I'll try.
 No, this place is too full of memories! I gotta clear my head! Okay, well, we've only been back to work like an hour.
 And bye.
 Liz, get in on this.
 Would you rather have to start every sentence you say for the rest of your life with Erkel's catchphrase, "Did I do that?" Or be Siamese twins with Sharon Stone for a year? Did I do that? Carol! So, Carol, you ever join the Mile High Club? Try five miles high, and no, I have not.
 Did you ever see a UFO up there? No, but once when I was in the Air Force, I saw Mr.
 T in a Pizza Hut.
 Was the Air Force like Top Gun? Yeah, but with a lot more volleyball.
 You ever kill anyone? Sucked a mechanic into my engine once.
 Are you on Facebook? And these are for you.
 A passenger left them in the first-class lavatory.
 Hey, I couldn't get a room in any of the Starwinds this weekend.
 You think it'd be all right if I stayed at your place? Uh, yeah, of course! I'll just have to run home first and take some plates out of the bathroom.
 But it would be nice staying together at your place, right? Yeah! Lt'll be a fun step for us.
 I just can't believe that every Starwinds suite in the city is taken.
 Me neither.
 Lady said they're all booked up for something called "Jackfest.
" How many rooms did you book? It's for your own good, Lemon.
 I just want you to have what Avery and I have.
 I am a grown woman! I have been doing things my way for a long time.
 I don't like my life stuff mixing with my dude stuff.
 A middle-aged woman saying "dude stuff," is that on my Sadness Scavenger Hunt? Why, yes, it is.
 Carol and I enjoy our separate but intersecting lifestyles.
 It's perfect.
 I'm like that woman on the Food Network whose husband only comes home on the weekends, and she spends the rest of her time eating and drinking with her gay friends.
 Her name is the Barefoot Contessa, Lemon, and you will never be like her, starting with the barefoot part.
 I'll have you know that I wore sandals this summer.
 Over socks.
 In a dream.
 Welcome to the Late Show with David Letterman.
 Please have your tickets out.
 And now, as with all studio audiences, we will sort you according to attractiveness.
 Front.
 Front.
 Back.
 Balcony.
 Front.
 Front.
 Mr.
 Jordan! No! You do not exist! I am in control of this! Wanna watch TV? First thing I need is tequila.
 Stop, wait, no.
 "The Barefoot Contessa.
" I love this show.
 Me too! This is one of the three things in the world I like: Ina Garten, sweater weather And when Muppets present at awards shows? Wow! Yes! Me too! We really see eye-to-eye on a lot of stuff, don't we? Absolutely.
 I've never met anyone before who had the exact same idea as me about what to do with Palestine.
 It would work, right? Of course it would work.
 And don't you agree that our situation is perfect right now? We have these great visits together, but then we still have our separate lives.
 We're like Geoffrey and Ina.
 No, no, I can't I can't live like this anymore! I'm not like Geoffrey Garten.
 I'm not as strong as that guy.
 Don't have too much fun without me, okay? I need to know where this relationship is going, and I can feel you resisting it.
 No! No! It okay! Don't be cry! I'm a I'm a pilot, Liz.
 You know, I spent my entire adult life just casual girlfriends in different cities.
 L-I-I-I can't go from woman to woman to woman anymore.
 How many women have you been with? No, no.
 I-I'd rather not say.
 It's shameful.
 And I'm a pilot.
 Six! Oh, that's not so great.
 I want grown-up love! Hello? Thanks! Carol had a complete meltdown about the state of our relationship.
 I can't believe I tried to clean my bathtub for this! You know, this is healthy, Lemon.
 Where is Carol now? I finally got him to sleep.
 I had to spoon him for like an hour, and I was the outer spoon! Welcome to adulthood.
 As for me, I have successfully retreated for another day.
 When Avery got home from work, I noticed that she had some paint samples in her purse, so I immediately asked her if her sister had done anything crazy lately, and guess what, she had.
 Avery talked about that for an hour, her anger eventually transforming into some rather interesting sex, and now she's sleeping peacefully while Fabius has retreated to his den where he is drinking scotch and playing Snood.
 Uh-huh.
 Does Avery's work e-mail go right to her phone? Why? Nothing.
 Just sending her a link to this cool site: Funkyvintagewallpaper.
 Com Oh, Lemon, don't! She keeps her Blackberry in bed with her! And send.
 Damn it, Lemon! It has to be Elk Tongue! This Jenna promotion is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.
 Do you understand how much free time I have now? Yesterday, I went to the gym.
 And this morning I made love to my wife.
 And she was still asleep, so I didn't have to be gentle.
 That's one of the most upsetting things I have ever imagined.
 Are you sure? Think about it again.
 Yes! Liz, the writers can't take a car service at night anymore.
 I've crunched the numbers, and it's cheaper for us to just replace anyone who gets murdered.
 So, did Avery like my wallpaper idea? She did.
 So why are you happy? Because the Fabian Strategy is working.
 Every new pattern Avery showed me, I would simply say, "Yes, I like that one, too.
" And she was so overwhelmed with the choices that she made a mistake.
 She suggested that we consult her old college friend who's an interior designer.
 Uh-huh.
 He's coming here to meet with me today.
 His name is James.
 Not Jim.
 Not Jimmy.
 James.
 I get it.
 She's sending her army into unknown territory.
 And I am flanking her with these.
 Have you seen my eyes, Lemon? Yep, they're very blue.
 Like a Mykonos sky.
 Mark Foley once called them "piercing.
" Avery has really made a misstep here.
 Do you know what a prize I am in the gay community? There's a term for it.
 I'm a Bear, and I'm a Daddy.
 I'm a Daddy Bear.
 Just one hour of flirty chatting with James, and you know what I'll get? Not a Glad Award, I know that.
 Elk Tongue.
 Well, I'm glad to hear that you've almost vanquished your girlfriend.
 Thank you.
 And you versus Carol? How's that going? I don't know.
 We had a pretty emotional breakfast.
 He says he's leaving early now.
 I don't know what to do.
 I know it's difficult, Lemon, but now you have an adult decision to make.
 Would you rather let go of your precious autonomy and let Carol into your life, or would you rather teach your cat to dial 9-1-1? First of all, I'm tired of playing "Would You Rather," and second of all, you know that I have Life Alert.
 Oh, I pushed it.
 I need a phone! Mr.
 Jordan! Mr.
 Jordan, please, stop! You're not real! If I threw you in front of a car it would drive right through you! No! No! Sir! I am real! Would an imaginary me know that you have a mole on your list of pets to get? Or that your favorite color is rainbow? Of course it would! It would know anything I knew! Because it sprung from my imagination.
 Sir! It's really me! Oh, my God! Oh, no! I missed it! Do it again! I love you, Kenwood! Why don't you come back home to TGS and pick the peas out of my fried rice? And the rice.
 I just want carrots.
 I can't do that, sir.
 Don't you miss rubbing my foot back into the shape of a foot? Of course I do.
 But I'm real happy here at CBS.
 They gave me a tote bag with "The Mentalist" on it! I guess this is good-bye.
 Obviously, I'm going to need the tote bag.
 James, tell me, which one of these do you like? Because with my untrained eyes, the strie is bland, and the, uh wallpaper just looks busy.
 I don't know.
 Do you see something, uh here that you like? It's so frustrating.
 I think I found a way to get the budget down to where Jack wants it.
 That's my girl! You are el fuego! I was looking it over, and I've realized something There's one too many producers, Pete.
 Okay, I get it.
 But please! I have five kids that I don't want to be at home with.
 No, Pete! It's me! As great as I am at this, I'm not really necessary.
 Hmmm the last time I said that, I was in a three-way with two of the Backstreet Boys.
 No, Jenna, you can't quit! I'll take a pay cut! We can fire Liz! This is hard for me, too, Pete, but it's because I'm a genius producer I know that you have to fire me.
 Take my producing fee and amortize it to cover the gaps in transpo and electric.
 Hey, Liz.
 Would you rather be with the person you love forever, but you always have to wear a shirt made out of their pubes, or be alone for the rest of your life, but you get to wear whatever you want? Shirt of pubes.
 I thought you left.
 I came back.
 I mean, I had to kick an obese teen off the flight to get a seat, but I really wanted to talk to you.
 Look, I'm not sorry you saw me cry.
 I'm an emotional guy.
 That's actually not even a part of my personality.
 That's just something that happens to people who change altitude more than four times a day.
 Is that also why you got so mad watching the Giants game? No.
 That was because why does Geico have three different spokespeople? They have the caveman, the lizard, and then the stack of money with the eyeballs.
 And the fake Rod Serling guy! Oh, my God! Right.
 Thank you.
 I mean, do you see how good we are together? Look, Liz, I want this, but if we're going to go for it, we gotta move forward a bit with each visit.
 Two minutes to air.
 Cast, please set yourself.
 Look, you have to get back to the airport, I have a show, and how do we move this forward in the time allotted? All right.
 Let's each say one thing about ourselves that the other person doesn't know on the count of three.
 All right? Ready? One, two, three.
 Touched by a priest.
 It's fine.
 I'm on a waiting list to adopt a kid.
 Wait.
 What? Okay.
 That was a step.
 Yeah.
 See you October 14! Cast for "Would You Rather?" Set yourselves please.
 I never thought you'd make it this far, Lemon.
 I know.
 Season 5, we were supposed to get cancelled.
 Not just the show.
 I mean you.
 You're in an "adult dude" situation.
 You're wearing a beautiful blazer from Rico's Husky Boy collection.
 Is that what "Raggazi Robusti" means? I'm just saying I'm happy for you.
 Thank you, Jack.
 And I'm glad that you're getting to keep your wall Elk Tongue.
 Actually, no.
 The fabulous James and I came up with an excellent idea.
 We're taking that wall down.
 That way, we can make the master bedroom closet bigger and gain a nice architectural symmetry.
 You think maybe that's what Avery wanted all along? Oh, my God! Hannibal defeated Fabian with a decoy army! James was a plant! The strie wall finish was a decoy! She Hanniballed my Fabian! Lemon, Avery and I are perfect together, like whiskey and hunting.
 Soul mate doesn't even begin to do it justice.
 She's my She's your pube shirt.
 Pube shirt.
 That's our show! Good night! Good night, Miss Maroney.
 Good night, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Good night, TGS band with your funny-smelling dressing room.
 Good night, Bear.
 Good night, Moon Song Park from accounting.
 Good night, Miss Lemon.
 Good night, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I lied to Mr.
 Jordan.
 I miss you all so much.
 Sir? Is it really you? Sure is.
 Wanna go kiss in the prop cage? What?! No! [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Hey, you! Back that and you can while I eat a combo mick! Disgusting, sir.
 Would you talk like that to your mother or your daughter or your surgeon? Just because my friend is blond and never closes her mouth fully Hey, I wasn't talking to her.
 I was talking to you, Glasses.
 I bet you have Pacific infected penis! That's never happened to me before.
 Well, I'm not surprised not because you're not cute.
 You are, like a pretty refugee on the news.
 It's because you've always put out this negative energy.
 But now that you're with someone, you're happy and confident.
 Guys can sense that.
 Confident, huh? So can I finally wear that cowboy hat I bought at KISS FM's Lake Jam '97? Um, the point is, being with someone makes people want to be with you.
 You know when it rains, it pours.
 Hey I want your feet in my mouth! When it rains, it pours! When it rains, it pours! Hello, "Javery.
" Time-saver.
 Lemon, we have news.
 Like God, I created man! We're having a boy! That's great! Congratulations! Think about it, Liz.
 Every woman my boy dates will get compared to me.
 And they will be found wanting.
 He's very lucky to have you as his mother.
 I'll tell you why he's lucky.
 He's got an old dad.
 I'm sorry? I had an old dad.
 It was awesome.
 I could get away with anything.
 This is just what I need to store my rock collection! Lemon, I am not an old dad.
 50 is the new 40 for men.
 50 is still 60 for women.
 Whatevs, Tony Randall.
 Whatevs, indeed.
 Because that makes you Jack Klugman.
 Damn! I'm a writer, I'm messy, I'm a lovable curmudgeon.
 That is solid! Advantage Donaghy.
 Hmm, rundowns are already out.
 I can't believe how smoothly everything's going without Kenneth here.
 I know! Do you remember my tattoo mishap? It was supposed to say "peace," but they wrote "white hooker" instead.
 I forgot I was getting it removed today, but someone slipped a note under my door to remind me.
 Well, no one could ever replace Kenneth, but these new kids are getting it done.
 Liz, Tracy will not be coming out of his dressing room today.
 Come on.
 What now? I'm werewolfing myself.
 Sure.
 You know when a dude knows he's gonna turn into a werewolf and locks himself into a jail? Well, I'm embarrassed to say I've missed the birth of both of my sons for very legitimate reasons.
 "Cooking a French-bread pizza" and "forgot.
" So I promised Angie I will not miss the birth of our daughter.
 She was due yesterday, so we're not taking any chances.
 Grizz is guarding the other door And reading.
 Also, we took Tracy's cell phone, his wallet And my mood ring! And I don't know how I feel about that.
 Well, I'm glad you're gonna be there for Angie.
 Good for you.
 And good for you, Liz Lemon.
 There's something about you lately.
 Make me want to put my feet in your mouth.
 It's your turn.
 What? Editing hasn't sent up the title sequence yet, and it's your turn to go down there.
 God, I hate how much power they have over us! Who do they think they are? Mommy and her sisters? Jeez, calm down.
 They know we need them, so they torture us! How's it going? I'm done, actually.
 Okay, you know what? I'll take care of editing from now on.
 Really? Yeah.
 I'll go down there, turn on the new Liz Lemon charm, a little Julia Roberts laugh What's in your teeth? Corn! I will be 70 years old when my son graduates prep school.
 Oh, come on, is this about my old-dad thing? I was joking! Will I even be there for his first subpoena? Will I ever experience the father-son bonding of realizing you were both at the same masked orgy at a castle? I will be senile or dead for the better part of my child's life.
 Am I pulling this off? I cannot escape death, Lemon, but I will cheat it.
 Whatever happens to me, I must find a way to speak to and guide my son, even from the grave.
 This is a test of the fire system.
 Please evacuate the building.
 You coming downstairs? And stand outside in a crowd like some Italian? I don't think so.
 You know, as Floor Fire Marshal, Kenneth always ran the fire drills.
 Who's doing it now? One of the new kids, I guess.
 This is a fire drill.
 All NB C employees, exit to the plaz a.
 I can't leave my dressing room until Angie goes into labor, but the President is saying we have to go outside.
 It's okay, Tray.
 We'll all go down together, then we'll bring you back up.
 Just stay with your grown-up.
 If I were a real werewolf, I'd wear baggy clothes so my nice clothes wouldn't get all torn up.
 Same rules for if I were the Hulk.
 I don't get why people like brunch.
 What's the benefit of combining break dancing and lunch? Tray? You're not Grizz! Hello? I am at the damn hospital! Where is Tracy? What? Good morning.
 Now, full disclosure most of my experience is putting babies in women.
 Oh, I'm gonna kill that man.
 You just described my morning.
 Now, Mrs.
 Jordan, I've already administered the epidural.
 So, would you like one as well? I am trying to help you.
 My son.
 You may not remember me.
 I am your father.
 This message is coming to you either from beyond the grave or because I am in the grip of insanity.
 The purpose of these DVDs is to educate and guide you through life in my absence.
 I will begin with our shared history.
 The Donaghys originally come from Ireland's little-known County Steve, where, historically, we were whiskey testers and goblins.
 I was raised in Sadchester, Massachusetts.
 I won the Amory Blaine Handsomeness Scholarship to Princeton, and then attended Harvard Business School, where I was voted "Most.
" I once hit a stand-up triple off Fidel Castro.
 I was the first person ever to say, "I need a vacation from this vacation.
" The song "You're So Vain" was, in fact, written by me.
 In other words, I have lived.
 In living, I have learned.
 And now I want to impart that knowledge to you.
 I will begin with the basics.
 You are hiking in the Japanese highlands.
 A pair of snow leopards is stalking you, and the blade of your katana is frosted into its scabbard What? What's up, Edit Seven gang! Ritchie, Donna, "Ray-yee" Split the difference, but keep the music where it is.
 What are you guys working on? Piece for the "Today" show about how next month is October.
 Islanders, huh? So, you think they're gonna end up trading "Fansonfen"? Who, Matt Moulson? They should.
 I'm better than that clown.
 So you play? Do I play? I go to Islanders Fantasy Camp every year.
 You must be a strong skater.
 I can't go backwards, but, yeah, I'm good.
 Were you in the army? Oh.
 No, better.
 Civil War re-enactor.
 I'm kind of an expert at getting shot by smoothbore firearms.
 You know, like Death to Lincoln! Oh, so, a Southern gentleman.
 Well, thank you.
 Thank you very much.
 Ritchie! Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Cool hat, by the way.
 Hey, you know what? Let's switch to the other deck.
 I forgot I got to get those 'TGS' titles done for Liz here.
 I just got to get to the hospital and wait there.
 Taxi! Sir, I don't have any money, but I need to get to Mount Sinai Hospital.
 No problem.
 Hop in.
 Wow.
 It's like I always say white cab drivers are weird.
 You're in the Cash Cab! It's a TV game show that takes place right here in my taxi.
 Explain the rules! You answer trivia questions for money and a free ride.
 But if you answer incorrectly, the game is over and you're out of the cab.
 So, for me to be there at the birth of my daughter, I have to answer trivia questions, despite having gone to middle school in an Exxon station? Yeah.
 You ready to play? Bring it.
 Your main titles, milady.
 And this is a CD of some Civil War songs I thought you'd like.
 It's very authentic.
 So don't play it around your black friends.
 Well, thanks, Ritchie.
 Okay.
 Oh! Wow, this is a nice hug.
 Two becoming one.
 What the hell, Liz? I thought Ritchie was lying.
 You know, if you wanted to cheat on Carol with an Italian dude who smells like cigarettes, I've made it very clear I would flip over my futon for you! Not cool! What is he talking about? Okay, it's not a big deal.
 Ritchie has just been telling the crew that you two are sleeping together.
 What? Your new vibe is a double-edged sword, much like the kind Mickey Rourke tried to kill me with.
 Great, so that's what I get for being happy, for being nice and rocking a cowboy hat that a KISS FM DJ once called a "sweet lid"? Wait, you can't say anything to him! Are you kidding me? If you do, he'll take it out on "TGS," on us! I'll be here waiting for edits till 4:00 in the morning when I should be at Home which is the name of a bar I found near the train station! I'm sorry, you want me to just take this for the team? Please.
 You know he can make our lives a living hell.
 We all make sacrifices, Liz.
 I had to be at work this morning at 11:00! Fine.
 Fine.
 Aw! You got sauce on me! You know, neighbors who wear my exact size don't die every day! A gift from France to the United States, the Statue of Liberty was completed in what year? Come on! I don't know that! You've got 1 5 seconds, or you're out of the cab.
 Okay.
 I remember going to the Statue of Liberty centennial, 'cause that year someone had spread a rumor that she was gonna slip out of her toga, and I wanted to see some green boobies.
 And the Mets had just won the World Series, 'cause that night I was randomly attacked by a Mets fan that I had threw a bottle at.
 And that was 1986.
 And a centennial is 100 years, because "centipeding" means having sex with 100 women.
 I got it 1886! Yes, that is correct! Weighing up to four tons, what type of mammal is the famous Shamu? She is an orca, Benjamin.
 FYI, they're very difficult to keep in a home aquarium.
 Right again! I'm coming, Angie! Son, I may not be there for your wedding.
 It breaks my heart to realize that, but I want to offer you one piece of fatherly advice.
 Do not hire Sting to play the reception.
 He'll insist on doing jazz versions of Police songs, and it's just demoralizing.
 After I'm gone, your mother may meet someone else.
 I want her to be happy, so his death must appear to be accidental.
 The secret to a strong, healthy head of hair is dove blood.
 Remember, the backflip is 90% confidence.
 Kenneth, what are you doing here? I'm sorry, sir.
 I was just sweeping your terrace, and then you came in, and I was trapped, just like the time I was cleaning my closet and my mom and her friend Ron came in to take one of their grunting naps on my bed Hang on, are you sneaking in here and working? I know how much you all need me Stop right there.
 Guess what.
 Other people can figure out how to sort the mail and answer the phones.
 We don't need you.
 So move on with your life starting now.
 That is called tough love.
 Kenneth is now on a journey that will either return him here where he belongs or end in his death.
 Juggling is easier than it looks.
 No, it is true.
 They're doing it.
 And we have this just in to us Ritchie and Liz spotted in tree.
 Eyewitnesses report K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
 For more, let's go to NBC's Andrea Mitchell.
 Thank you, Brian.
 Slut.
 Who do you think you are? Ritchie Tamuto, Islanders fan and role-playing slave owner.
 I know what you've been saying about me.
 That we're sleeping together? You know what, Ritchie? I'm actually seeing someone right now.
 And he's never around because he's a pilot.
 His name is Carol.
 That sounds really fake.
 I know how it sounds! And Carol is the reason I was nice to you.
 Because for once in my life, I felt like being nice.
 Well, I don't care how you punish my show, it's over.
 I take my hug back! No, Liz.
 That is not why I did it.
 Oh, reallo? I meant to say "really.
" I misspoke.
 Continue.
 Oh, come in, come in, come in, come in.
 Liz, are you familiar with the phrase "when it rains, it pours"? I don't meet a lot of women.
 I started doing fantasy-hockey camp and Civil War re-creationism to meet girls, but I don't know where they are.
 So, yes.
 When you were nice to me, I took advantage of it to try to make someone else notice.
 Who? My assistant editor, Donna.
 For seven years, I've been sitting close enough to touch her but a million miles away.
 I am really sorry that I did what I did.
 But it's just that I am in love with her.
 I love her so much.
 Oh, Donna! Donna Straunk! All right, I'll make you a deal.
 So many memories.
 Hello, Parcell and a squatter's residence.
 Where the hell is Tracy Jordan?! Mrs.
 Jordan? Oh, I don't I'm out of my mind on a lot of drugs right now Drugs during childbirth? Isn't the whole point feeling God punish you? If that man is not here for this, it is over! You hear me? The lazy Susan was invented by Thomas Jefferson.
 I know, 'cause I'm a descendant of Thomas Jefferson and Lazy Susan herself! The capital of the United Arab Emirates is Abu Dhabi.
 I know that because if I go back there, I'll be executed! There are 12 tones in the chromatic scale.
 I know that because I'm a musical genius This is how you throw a punch.
 Wait, what? "and the tree was happy.
" Shel Silverstein was a communist.
 and that is the art of camouflage.
 Now, this is how you make love to a woman.
 Huh? Pull, Angie! Pull! I knew you wouldn't let me down, baby.
 Of course not, woman! I'm your husband! Damn it, I've got to go feed the meter.
 Oh, hey, Ritchie, are we still on for the music concert this weekend? Liz, we need to talk about us.
 Liz, we've had a lot of fun End it? Why? but I need to end it.
 End it? Why? Without you around, who's gonna satisfy my sex needs and then some? Oh, Liz, you'll find someone.
 No, I won't.
 Not someone like you.
 How many guys out there have a fully loaded Toyota Tercel or a real pinball machine? How many guys have been to Canada twice? Are you doing this to me because I don't share your love of unicorns? Oh, Liz, don't blame yourself.
 It's my fault.
 See you in another life, kiddo.
 I guess some other woman will get to enjoy that water bed that you're saving up for.
 What's up, Ritchie? Congratulations, we're here, Tracy! You made it! Tracy Jordan hero, husband, diabetic/alcoholic! Yes! Hold on, let me unlock it for you.
 Am I pulling it right? Just let go of the handle.
 Okay.
 It's still not opening.
 Stop pulling it.
 I'm trying to pull it.
 You keep saying pull it.
 Tracy, if you're pulling on it while I'm hitting the button What do you want me to do? Yelling at me ain't gonna make it better.
 It's not gonna unlock! Stop pulling I'm freaking out! God, what's wrong with it? Oh, it's upside down.
 My bad.
 Well, Angie, you did it.
 We did it.
 I was here for you 'Cause I love you, baby.
 And I will always be by your side, no matter what Discovery Channel game show stands in my way.
 I wouldn't have missed whatever just happened here for anything.
 I don't know what I'd do without you.
 And I mean it.
 Why is that baby covered with goop? Because everything about this is disgusting! As you go through life, I will always be here for you through these tapes.
 Also, I have given a great deal of money to the Catholic Church and have been assured that I will have certain powers in Heaven sending messages through animals, for instance.
 In the unlikely event that you encounter something that is not covered here, find a woman named Elizabeth Lemon, get her advice, and then do the opposite.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, I'm sorry, but you were wrong, sir.
 I am needed here, more than I ever knew.
 Very well.
 I'll let HR know.
 No, sir.
 If I am going to return, it must be through the proper channels.
 I'm going to reapply to the NBC Page Program following standard procedures for acceptance.
 You do whatever you want to, Kenneth.
 I won't let you down, sir! I really don't care.
 Your ability to hide your true feelings is part of your great strength! You ready for this, Jackie D? As of today, yes.
 I made all my videotapes.
 Explain.
 I'm not gonna be around forever, Tracy, so I recorded advice for every scenario my son could face.
 Jackie D, you want to make God laugh? Make a plan.
 Or read Him a Dave Barry book.
 You're worried about being old, Jack? You could live forever, but you still can't predict what happens in life.
 Wait a minute.
 There's no baby in here! Good God! Oh, she's in the crib.
 Good.
 Avery, I'm with Tracy.
 We're having a damn girl.
 What? That Russian skank read the ultrasound wrong.
 I'm just so worried about her spatial reasoning and upper-body strength.
 Jack, talk me down.
 I'm having a girl! I hate to say, "I told you so," so welcome to Miami.
 I've got to make new tapes.
 My daughter.
 I am John Francis Donaghy.
 I am your father.
 If you have the blondeness and self-esteem of your mother, you will need no advice.
 Life will be easy for you.
 Otherwise, I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth Lemon.
 Good afternoon.
 Let's jump in.
 Every human has hair on his or her face, some of us just have more.
 I think it's nice to occasionally splurge on a straight-razor shave.
 If you're running low on laundry, a bathing suit makes perfectly acceptable underwear.
 Bandanas are a fun, sexy fashion accessory This is over.
 Let me give my reasons.
 Put potato chips on a sandwich! [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Look at this.
 The writers put it on my door.
 I don't know what that's referring to.
 It's referring to this one time that I got a chemical peel before work.
 And I was wearing a red-and-green sweater.
 And a fedora.
 But these douche-b's have been doing this for weeks.
 "Lez Lemon.
" First thought.
 "Winona Ryder.
" "In a Hundred Years.
" Weak.
 "Fart Barfunkel.
" Indian food.
 "Paul Simon.
" I don't get that, but it hurts.
 Look, I love a good joke.
 But I am their boss, and at a certain point it crosses a line.
 To quote Rodney Dangerfield, "Hey! I, uh" "Hey! I, uh" Lemon, if you're about to say that you don't get any respect, you're right.
 I mean, in a post-apocalyptic world, how would society even use you? Traveling bard! Radiation canary.
 I have to run, Lemon.
 I have an appointment in Washington.
 The hearings on the KableTown/NBC deal are underway, and the company has entrusted me to be their front man.
 Hey, will you ask Congress where they put the USA Network? I've been trying to find "Monk" for, like, three months.
 The only thing I will be discussing with the House Subcommittee on Baseball, Quiz Shows, Terrorism and Media is vertical integration.
 What's vertical integration? Lmagine that your favorite corn chip manufacturer also owned the number-one diarrhea medication.
 That would be great 'cause then they could put a little sample of the medicine in each bag.
 Keep thinking.
 Except then they might be tempted to make the corn chips give you Vertical integration.
 Wow.
 That should not be allowed to happen.
 But it's my job to make sure that it does happen.
 Do you know who gets elected to Congress these days? Former athletes, washed-up actors, and women.
 I'm locked and loaded and ready for whatever these Beltway lobotomites throw at me.
 What if we have to stay overnight and there aren't enough rooms so we have to share a room and I forgot to bring a shirt to sleep in and the stores are all closed? Liz, quick question about the Johnny Appleseed sketch.
 Does it hurt it if we can't call him "Johnny Appleseed"? Yes! Why? Well, Johnny Appleseed was a real guy, and his descendants are very litigious.
 So, here is a list of the names that Legal says we can use: "Jerry Bananaseed.
" And nothing else.
 Great.
 So what are my choices? Either I argue with Legal or I spend all day writing something else? Does anyone care how hard I work? Oh, we can't use "Jerry Bananaseed.
" Someone with that name killed a bunch of nurses in Portland.
 Kenneth, you're back! I need you to get me something called Vagitrax.
 It's for dry knees.
 I wish I were back, Ms.
 Maroney.
 I'm reapplying to the page program, but it's a lot harder than my first time around.
 It's gotten really competitive.
 You should have seen what I saw in Mr.
 Winerslav's office.
 Well, your interview will be Thursday.
 Is there any A/V equipment you'll be needing? Equipment? "Inside Schwartz," "21," "Hill Street Blues," "Wings" is fun, "Golden Girls," "Quantum Leap," "Outsourced" is the new "Friends" The process used to be dignified.
 Now it's just a pageant.
 "Just a pageant"? That's like saying a guy is cool because he has "just a speedboat.
" If you need help winning a pageant, you've come to the right place.
 Well, if it'll get me back into the page program When I was pageantizing, my mother told me, "There's only three things standing between you and winning.
 Your breasts and wanting it bad enough.
" I'm not sure that applies We've already started.
 And this deal will count as a 39%bump variable against an 11%increase of synchronized flexibility.
 Sir, my name is Rob Reiner, and before I became a Congressman I dabbled in television.
 Won a couple of Emmys.
 And I believe that my experience out there in "Hollyweird" gives me a special insight into these types of deals.
 Particularly when it comes to Say it, Meathead.
 vertical integration.
 Ah, the dreaded V.
I.
 Bad for America, kills innovation, drives up prices, is that it? I guess that's why Big Oil and Microsoft are such great American failures.
 What? Dare I say vertical integration drives down prices by streamlining the process.
 Consider the farmer.
 He owns his land, the equipment he uses to harvest his crops, the trucks he uses to drive that product to the farmer's market where he sells it directly to the consumer.
 Is that not vertical integration? ladies and gentlemen, that Congress put a bullet in the head of the American farmer.
 No! You win! The acclaimed director of "When Harry Met Sally" would never do that! As always, it's been a pleasure.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, one last question.
 Why is NBC so racist? Horrible! What else can you do? Oh, everybody born before Jesus is in hell They went straight to hell Enough! I'm going to have to reinvent you, break you down completely and build you up from scratch.
 Just like Mickey Rourke did to me sexually.
 But, Ms.
 Maroney, I don't want to be reinvented.
 I want to be me! All right.
 First things first.
 Can you lose that goony accent? I don't know, Ma'am.
 You made me think about it, and wen'ah git ta thinkabow it ihjuh geh wahr! Mr.
 Donaghy, I represent Rhode Island's First Congressional District.
 It's a diverse community, from the hard-working moms and dads of Smithfield to the spoiled jags at Brown to the thriving, flourishing Italian criminal community in Providence.
 It's my responsibility to make sure that public airwaves represent the face of my public.
 Now, one question, why is it that NBC looks about as diverse as a Wilco concert? I would point to, um, "Sunday Night Football", which features many black players and coaches.
 Oh, and we have Anthony Anderson, the star of "Law &amp; Order," which is entering its 21st What? Why did we cancel that? That doesn't make any sense! Mr.
 Donaghy, this may just be about money to you, but as a member of Congress and a black woman I don't really see color or gender, Mr.
 Chang.
 I feel I have an extra duty not just to my constituents, but to future generations.
 Now, unless I see some serious change at NBC, and soon, I can guarantee you this deal will not happen.
 Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb.
 Peas and carrots, rhubarb.
 Rhubarb, peas and carrots, rhubarb.
 Dotcom, you run Tracy's production company, right? Yes, Dotcom Productions.
 That's "Tracy Jordan" spelled backwards.
 Well, I need programming for the African-American community, and nobody knows that demographic better than you.
 Don't worry about it, Jackie D.
 I'm on it.
 Call Grizz.
 I need someone around who's not just a yes man.
 Whatever you say, Tray.
 Aw, come on, Walter! What is going on? Representative Regina Bookman is using the KableTown hearings as a soapbox from which to complain about a lack of diversity on TV.
 Well, she has a point.
 I was reading the new Malcolm Gladwell New Yorker piece on my Kindle.
 Did you really read that? No, I did not.
 I really resent the Congresswoman's accusations.
 I've long been an advocate for diversity.
 It's made this nation great.
 The Chinese built the railroads, the Irish built and then filled the jails A guy named Juan built my armoire.
 Diversity means new ideas and new markets.
 It is our best hope for true innovation.
 Did you tell all that to Congresswoman Bookman? No, I was too busy trying to remember the name of the black kid on "Community".
 Donald Glover It wouldn't have mattered anyway.
 The whole thing was just political theater.
 You should have seen her grandstanding.
 the future and America! Now, I may have lost my train of thought several minutes ago, but if I continue to talk like this, no one will notice, and when I stop, you will applaud my energy! Thank you! Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 I can't let Bookman jeopardize this deal.
 Tell me about diversity at 'TGS'.
 Well, Lutz claims to be Inuit.
 At least that was his explanation when I found his poem about snow.
 What about Toofer? Is he any good? I don't know if he's mentioned this to you 100 times, but he went to Harvard.
 So we know he's smart and superb at masturbation.
 Ha! Is there any way we can give him a promotion of some kind? Sure.
 Make him co-head writer.
 I always figured he'd take over for me when I die at my desk.
 Really? You're okay with that? Oh, yeah.
 Let someone else share the total lack of respect.
 Deal with the meetings, the complaining, this stupid Johnny Appleseed sketch.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, you are not doing a sketch on the Appleseed family.
 Monty Appleseed and I share a liquor locker at the opera! Agh! I forgot my doctor said, "No more frustrated noises," because it makes my vocal cords Now it's going to be like this all day! There you are.
 I've got hair extensions for you and a body shaper with a reinforced penile sleeve Ms.
 Maroney, please.
 My feet are killing me.
 I am trying to help you, Kenneth.
 Believe me, I wish you weren't such a Houston foreclosure of a human being, but I need to tear you down and turn you into someone that can actually win this thing! They hired Keyboard Guy? He's not even recycling properly! Ms.
 Maroney, wait! So, what do we want to see on TV? I personally love cop shows.
 I can't wait for "Law &amp; Order" to start back up.
 Why? It was a tent-pole! A tent-pole! Well, here's something I've been working on.
 It's called "Let's Stay Together," after the Al Green song.
 It focuses on an African-American family in Detroit in the '70s.
 Motown, the auto industry, Vietnam, Watergate.
 "Let's Stay Together" is not just about a family trying to stay together, but also a nation.
 What if there was a talking dog? I'd like to see that incorporated into your rewrite.
 Okay.
 Meeting over.
 Thank you, NB C, for all the laughs and tears Once home to Kelsey Grammer "The Golden Girls," "My Name is Earl" "The A-Team" and "Cheers" So shine on And thank you, NB C A top-ten network! Smile! Okay, let's dig in, cohorts.
 It means "The Badger" in Spanish.
 I'm not sure who did it.
 Toofer's got a "Head Writer" sign on his door! It's great, good for him.
 Oh, God, tejón face! Is this about the TV interview? What TV Interview? It's nothing.
 It's just a local cable show.
 Well, if my co-head writer is being interviewed, then so am I.
 ¡ Aquí viene el tejón! The only thing that worked in the read-through was the dog.
 How's production going, Tray? Good.
 And there's a lot of buzz.
 Can you hear it too, or is my tinnitus acting up? Hey! That food is for Dotcom Productions only.
 TGS's food is backstage! But they don't have women's sport bars! Men can have cramping, too, you know! Mr.
 Donaghy! I have Representative Bookman on the line.
 Representative Bookman.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, I'm in New York right now.
 Some colleagues of mine and I are taking meetings on Wall Street, and then we're doing the "Sex and the City" walking tour.
 Magnolia Bakery? Oh, sorry, hips! But it looks like I'll have time to stop by and continue our conversation.
 Good.
 I welcome it.
 As I was trying to say the other day, this company has a long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusiveness.
 Yo, Jackie D, I had dinner with Don Imus last night.
 He told the following joke Good-bye, Congresswoman! I can't believe they rejected me.
 Well, of course, they did.
 The bridge was supposed to be: Shuffle-ball-change, Maxie Ford, Cincinnati, Cincinnati, double-time, shim-sham-shimmy, toe punch! I don't know what you were doing! I'm sorry, Ms.
 Maroney.
 And where was your sparkle? You embarrassed me in front of all the other mothers! If you think you're going to Sizzler tonight, Jenna, you've got another think coming.
 You'll be practicing your steps in the garage until the school boat comes! If I hadn't seen you come out of me in that parking lot, I'd swear you weren't my daughter! Oh, my God.
 What just happened? I think you've just turned into your Let me get there! I've turned into my mother.
 And I've turned you into me.
 You're welcome, but it was wrong.
 Well, to make it up to me Let me get there! To make it up to you, I am going to get your job back! Or my name isn't Yustrepa Gronkowitz! I mean Jenna Maroney! Welcome to "Right On.
" I'm your host, Rutherford Rice.
 With me is my co-host, Shirley Thomas.
 Our topic for today is "African-Americans and Their Roles in the Media".
 Our first guest is James Spurlock, head writer for "TGS with Tracy Jordan.
" Good day, Tri-Staters.
 "Co.
" Co-head writer.
 And also with us is someone named Elizabeth Lemon.
 Thank you, Rutherford.
 It is a pl I can tell that you're off me.
 Mr.
 Spurlock, do you think the system is broken when it is news that an African-American man is the head writer for a network TV show? I think I can answer that.
 Another question that we could be asking is why isn't it a big deal that a woman is a head writer? I would argue that TV is more of a boys' club than a white club.
 I like your dress.
 Do you have to wear a bra with it? I'll let you get back to Toofer.
 Who's Toofer? I don't know.
 James, when people think of 'TGS' they think of Tracy Jordan, Jenna Maroney, the mysterious crew deaths, the Angela Lansbury lawsuit, What they don't think of is you, working long hours, late into the night, giving up any semblance of a life.
 Well, James Spurlock, you can finally take your bow.
 You are "Right On's" "Arthur Ashe of the Week" Okay, you know what? I get it.
 I shouldn't be here.
 I should have realized that when I saw the masks and the picture of black Jesus That's me in college.
 All-righty.
 But I said I was leaving! You don't have to have your boss come and It's a security guard.
 That's not great.
 Sir, Representative Bookman is on her way up! Jonathan, what did we talk about? But, sir, I was born in Palo Alto.
 I will go get her, sir! A thousand apologies! Jack, it's an actor me-mergency! I want to get Kenneth back into the page program, but whatever this is won't let me.
 What? Who cares? Jeffrey, just hire Kenneth back.
 But, Mr.
 Donaghy, the only I don't have time for this.
 Just do it.
 Thank you, Jack.
 Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Representative Bookman, welcome to NBC.
 This is the perfect place to begin our tour.
 Studio 6H, home to one of NBC's biggest stars, Tracy Jordan.
 Mr.
 Jordan.
 Regina Bookman.
 We met at that Congressional Black Caucus fundraiser you crashed your motorcycle into.
 And thank you, Representative.
 What you're doing is very important.
 I can assure you that NBC is committed to making diversity our priority.
 Then just walk away.
 And don't try to kiss her, Tracy.
 And don't say that last part.
 Hey! You eat from your own table, remember? Our food is separate! Separate! I'll kill you, white devil! Let's just head this way.
 So, how was your flight? Congresswoman, this is Jeffrey Winerslav.
 He heads our Diversity-in-Hiring initiative.
 What's the latest from H.
R.
, Jeffrey? Well, I'd like to tell you that we filled the minority slot in the NBC page program with a Native-American fellow named "Wants To Get Sandwiches.
" But you made me hire that guy instead.
 Oh, brother! Mr.
 Shoelace, you're being silly! You call that a diversity hire? Maybe.
 That young man is a hillbilly with a girl's middle name and because his county never rejoined the Union, a foreigner.
 Now you're untied? Have you two been talking? There's James! Attention, everyone.
 Oh, give me a break! I present you, James Spurlock, with the 2010 Tavis Smiley Excellence in Broadcasting Award.
 Thank you for making us all "Smiley".
 Mr.
 Spurlock, how long have you been head writer here? One day.
 Mm-hmm.
 And who is the real head writer of this show? I am.
 Ah! Tell me, you obviously lonely and tired woman, do you have to put up with this nonsense every day? Yes.
 You know, they say 90% of the work is done by 10% of the people.
 Thank you for being that 10%.
 You're welcome.
 After what I just saw, you may be the only person here I respect.
 You get an "I Met a Congresswoman" sticker.
 Thank you! Finally! That's all I wanted! This country was founded on certain principles! Oh, brother.
 Freedom.
 Troops.
 America.
 Flag.
 I might not know where I'm going with this, but I know we will get there together! Who loves pizza? Congresswoman, a word.
 Okay, fine.
 I was putting on a show.
 I was tap dancing.
 But you made me tap dance.
 Did someone say "tap dance"? What was I supposed to do? This is a multi-billion-dollar deal.
 There are thousands of jobs at stake.
 Hundreds of second homes! And your ridiculous grandstanding could ruin the whole thing, like luffing your spinnaker during a yachting regatta I know I'm not helping myself! Sorry, "grandstanding"? Do you not think I believe in this? It's just political theater.
 You're up for re-election.
 Yes, maybe I get carried away sometimes with my love for this great country and the troops and the flagtroops You're doing it! And I apologize.
 But I only talk this way so I can get people to listen.
 I care about these issues.
 And so do I.
 If you'd just give me a chance, instead of ambushing me in front of the Congress and my own employees! You think I don't take diversity seriously? Only a fool doesn't.
 Diversity is the engine that drives this country.
 We are an immigrant nation.
 The first generation works their fingers to the bone making things.
 The next generation goes to college and innovates new ideas.
 The third generation snowboards and takes improv classes.
 We always need people who are pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.
 I did it.
 And it's my job to help others do it, too.
 How do I know you really mean that? How do I know you're not just grandstanding? Oh, I'll show you how.
 Unless you give me a real reason not to, I'm voting "no" on this deal.
 Then I've got three months to change your mind.
 I'll show you that this company I'm cutting that fat cracker's head off! I'm part Eskimo! Hate crime! Three months, Congresswoman! We were here first! They closed the plant.
 I gave those people 30 years.
 I didn't even get a watch.
 All I got was this pink slip.
 You think you've got it hard, I've got two dates tonight.
 Stanley, even for a dog, you are a dog! Yes! Great fix, Grizz.
 Uh-oh.
 Ain't life a bitch? [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Cast, you should change for the cold open.
 Hey, you wanted to see me? Does it seem weird in here to you? Everything looks like a Mexican soap opera.
 I don't know.
 Does it? My God, I can see every line and pore on your face.
 Yeah, well, my face cream was recalled.
 Apparently, it was destroying the lab rats', uh What is that word? Brains.
 Brains.
 I just wanted you to know that, while Avery is pregnant, I am giving up drinking.
 If she can't drink, I won't drink.
 Wow.
 I don't know if that's a good idea for you.
 Remember what happened that time I tried to give up refined sugars? Hey, looking good, Liz! Thank you.
 Thank you.
 You know what? Our bodies don't want all of that processed junk.
 I don't know if you've had a chance to read Michael Pollan Who wants doughnuts? I will kill you! How come you're better-looking in your memory? 'Cause my memory has "Seinfeld" money.
 Well, don't worry.
 For me, the drinking has always been about the ritual.
 So I just need to replace the ritual, and therefore, Avery has gotten me this very nice tea set, some knitting needles and some yarn, and a book on sleight-of-hand magic.
 That's as far as I've gotten.
 Okay, well, if that's it I'm gonna go downstairs.
 Have a good show.
 I'm dreading watching it sober.
 Hey, Jack knows it's my birthday, right? Oh.
 I have my master list of staff birthdays right here.
 Oh, no, I seem to have forgotten to put you on it! Is this because of that joke I made the other day? Jonathan, can I have a pen? Yeah, and hurry up, Aladdin before Jasmine is forced to marry Jafar.
 Similarities.
 Lemon out.
 I don't know what you're talking about.
 Whatever.
 Jack will remember my birthday because we're friends.
 Also, it's a pretty big birthday.
 Oh, are you turning a thousand? Really? You want to play this game with a comedy writer? Oh, God! Live show It's the "30 Rock" live show It's "30 Rock" live It's live, and there's one more perk There's a chance that it might not work Why, though, do a "30 Rock" live show? Why "30 Rock" live? In five, four, three, two, one Because this is my gift to you, our audience Oh, hi, Jadwiga.
 Hellos! Haven't seen you in a long time.
 Yes.
 Bullet in brain move.
 Much hospital.
 Wow.
 I'm glad you're back.
 Oh, I want to tell you, there's probably gonna be a party tonight because it's my birthday.
 Oh, "Happy Days" is my favorite show! Yeah, "Happy Days" is a great show.
 But what I mean is there might be a little bit of a mess, so Yeah.
 Are we understanding each other? Yeah, yeah.
 I clean you now? No, no, you don't have to clean me.
 I'm just saying you might have to clean up after a surprise party later 'cause it's my birthday, and it's a big one! What are we doing, Jadwiga? I like Fonzie! Hey! His office is bathroom, just like Jadwiga! Okay.
 Good talk, Jadwiga.
 Oh, Miss Maroney, I have your messages.
 A Mr.
 Brett Fav-ray stopped by and dropped off this picture of a hot dog.
 Finally! The Chilean miners are all out, and they're really angry about what you've been saying about them.
 So, I guess they're geniuses for getting stuck in a mine.
 Also, your pharmacy called.
 Apparently, you can't get a prescription for Ecstasy.
 Thanks, Obamacare.
 If you need someone to scream at, I'm right here! Hey, Kenneth.
 Oh.
 Hello, Miss Lemon.
 What's up, Giggly? Oh, I don't know.
 Nothing.
 Mr.
 Hornberger needs to see you in Mr.
 Jordan's dressing room right away.
 Oh, really? I wonder why.
 I don't know.
 You better find out! Surprise, Liz! Tracy's come up with a new way to ruin the show.
 What? No, no.
 I told you, your lizard cannot be the musical guest.
 Of course not.
 His album doesn't drop until December! No, no, Liz.
 Last night, for the first time ever, Tracy watched the non-porn version of "The Carol Burnett Show.
" Sure.
 It was even funnier than the porn version! The best part is when the actors started cracking up.
 They laughed so hard, they didn't even finish the skit! And your point is? I would like to do that, please.
 Do what? Crack up instead of saying these stupid lines I wrote.
 Hey, stupid lines I wrote.
 And no, we're not doing that.
 You never take my creative suggestions! The only other one I can remember is the time you wanted me to hire those two strippers to dance behind you! And you should have! Those dudes were awesome! And so is my crack-up idea.
 Okay, Tracy, what you're talking about is called breaking.
 And, sure, audiences love it when something goes wrong, okay, but we don't do that here.
 It's cheap.
 So no breaking, promise? Promise.
 I swear on my mother's grape.
 Wait, did you say "grave" or "grape"? Yes.
 Good-bye.
 Gentlemen, tonight I'm gonna laugh harder than I did at Dotcom's play! It was "Angels in America," Tray.
 Miss Lemon, Mr.
 Donaghy called.
 Why are you giggling like that? It's very misleading.
 I'm sorry.
 It's just that Mr.
 Lutz is wearing a hilarious t-shirt, and every time I see him Just look! Whoever's standing next to him is stupid! That guy is stupid! Now she is! Now they are! Now I were! It's good.
 Anyway, Mr.
 Donaghy called while you were with Mr.
 Jordan.
 He needs to see you right away.
 Liz, I almost forgot.
 "Happy Birthday" the song legal says we can't use it in the birthday sketch.
 But we can use "It's Your B-Day, Bitch" by Snooki's mom.
 Did you just knit that? I need a drink, Lemon.
 Oh, already? Okay, we can get through this.
 It turns out it's not the ritual.
 According to a bunch of online questionnaires, I have a drinking problem.
 Oh, God.
 I have a splitting headache! Okay.
 Replace the ritual.
 Replace the ritual.
 Could you come over here, please? Yeah, here we go.
 All right, shh.
 Did you finish the magic book? I cannot divulge my secrets! I don't want to let Avery down, but this is so hard.
 Distract me, Lemon.
 Entertain me.
 Okay Open on the Covent Garden Flower Market! The year 1892! Flowers, flowers for sale! Get out of here! Did he remember your birthday? Oh, come on! What's up, New York? Tracy Jordan in the house! You're the real stars! Not really! Fox News, a division of Fox Nonsense, Incorporated.
 Welcome back to Fox News.
 I'm blond.
 President Obama, in your own words, why are you a terrorist who hates America? That's an excellent question.
 Uh-oh! I'm doing something called breaking! Snort! Hee-hee! Giggle-giggle! The audience loves this! Oh, that idiot.
 Fine.
 Just go to commercial.
 Go to commercial! Erectile dysfunction.
 It's not just a dog problem anymore.
 It also affects millions of men.
 Hello, I'm "Doctor" Leo Spaceman.
 For too long, erectile dysfunction has been viewed as a physical problem.
 And it's been treated with pills and ointments and contraptions whose straps break all too easily! But couldn't the real cause of E.
D.
 Be that we haven't produced a good doing-it song since "Close the Door" by Teddy Pendergrass? That's why I recorded an album.
 Baby, let's take it slow You know we've got all night Light some candles, draw a bath And start off with full-on intercourse Guaranteed to end erectile dysfunction, these are the sweet sounds of Dr.
 Leo Spaceman's "Love Storm," an ultra-strength audio rebonulator.
 Baby, let's let the dog watch us Do you think he understands the love that we have? Oops, I'm finished Call yourself a cab Hey, idiot! Liz, I know we're not usually the most grateful bunch, but everybody here, and I mean everybody, is signing this birthday card for Jadwiga the cleaning lady.
 Really? Jadwiga's birthday.
 I look out for her.
 We're friends with benefits.
 Tracy! You should be ashamed of yourself.
 I can't be.
 I'm missing that part of my brain.
 Why are you doing this? Why does anybody do anything? Because they're rich and they have attention deficit disor Look at Lutz's t-shirt.
 You are ruining the show.
 No more laughing.
 No more laughing.
 Kraut's honor.
 Wait, did you say "scout" or "kraut"? Good-bye.
 Carol, I knew you wouldn't forget about me today.
 No nonessential chatter, Liz.
 I'm having the worst flight of my career.
 We got wind shears, lightning, severe turbulence.
 The in-flight meal was a frittata.
 Oh, my God, at night? Lizzie, if something were to happen, I just want you to know that I I need you to go to Raleigh to my apartment and just clear out all the porn before my mom gets there.
 That's it? Yeah.
 I also need you to TiVo "Bones" for me in case I survive.
 No.
 You know what, Carol? Today is a very special day, and you should have know that! And you should also know that you can't use cell phones on planes.
 No, that's just something we tell passengers Oh, hello! Hold on! All right, yeah.
 I think I just screwed up something with my girlfriend.
 You know, I've always loved you.
 Not now, Kevin.
 Copy that.
 Liz, how could you let Tracy do this to me? No, don't worry.
 It's under control or not.
 I am a professional, Liz.
 I have never broken during a performance, ever.
 I was on stage in "Pippin" with Irene Ryan when she died, and I kept going.
 I know.
 And that is why you're so amazing.
 Oh, I have never broken, Liz.
 But if he tries to pull that stunt again, I will have a wardrobe malfunction.
 Oh, I will slip a nip, Liz.
 So help me, I will slip a nip.
 Are you sniffing paint? Of course I am, Lemon.
 Men need alcohol.
 It gives us the ability to hit on women and later, when we're married, to tune them out.
 I don't know how much more of this I can take.
 This is the worst day of my life.
 Of your life? Of your life? Oh, God.
 How are we going to make this about you? It's my birthday, Jack! It is my 40th birthday, and no one remembered! Damn these she beasts! What? You and Avery, you lay these traps for me to fail! I'm sorry I forgot your birthday, Lemon.
 It's not my best day.
 I'm not myself right now.
 But please accept this thousand dollars as my gift to you.
 I will take this on principle, but it doesn't fix anything.
 What can I tell you? This is what happens to people like you and I who put work ahead of everything else.
 You know where I spent my 40th birthday? In my office all night.
 Wow.
 You were very fit back then.
 Yes, but my penis was smaller.
 Jack, I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.
 I know who I am.
 I know I'm not the funnest person in the group.
 I'm not the one you call when you want to go clubbing on the town and party, dance all night.
 Why are you speaking like a Persian immigrant? I thought at least these dummies would do something for me besides light a bunch of fires I have to put out.
 I thought that when I turned 40 a 40 right now.
 Oprah, this is what the inside of a child's face looks like.
 Oh, no! My Oprah wig is falling off! This is an exciting mishap! This is live! What the blerg? Jenna.
 Yeah.
 Have you been drinking? No, Jack.
 I mean, I had a bottle of wine with dinner.
 Can I smell your mouth? I thought you'd never ask.
 Thank you.
 I really, really needed that.
 I've been giving up drinking while Avery's pregnant, and it's really hard.
 Oh, of course.
 But being with someone, Jack, means making sacrifices.
 I've learned that by being with Paul.
 It's made me so much more mature.
 Oh, no, Tracy.
 It is nipple time! Now my moustache is askew! Oops, that thing fell off! And that thing, too! Uh-oh! Now my shirt is accidentally falling off! America! I warned you, Liz! And now I am slipping a nip! The big one! Go to commercial! To commercial, go! Hi, I'm Dr.
 Drew Baird.
 Every year, dozens of people lose a hand to a helicopter or fireworks mishap or, in my case, both.
 But now there's hope.
 Thanks to an idea that started as a pitch for a horror movie and grew into a charitable organization, hands from executed criminals are now making life better for people all over the world people like me.
 But we can't do it without your support.
 So give, and give someone a hand.
 Sorry, I'm trying to do a thumbs-up here.
 It doesn't always listen.
 Oh, God, no, that's a Black Power thing.
 I really shouldn't Come here.
 No! No! Why are you doing that? No! Bad hand! Now it's got my testicles! Listen up.
 We forgot Liz Lemon's birthday, her 40th birthday.
 How? You gave me your list! Never mind how it happened.
 That's water under the bridge.
 Wait, I'm sorry, we don't have that expression in Canada.
 Does that mean that what happened can be used to power a lumber mill? It means we're going to do something nice for our friend Liz Lemon.
 Because she takes care of us, we are going to take care of her.
 Even if we are currently sober for the first time in 10 years.
 Not me.
 I just got my 10-year drunk chip.
 Thank you! Pete, what can you pull together? Is there time to do something for Liz on air? Not really.
 I mean, I could cut the product placement for Capital One.
 Oh, no.
 You can't do that! The Capital One Venture Card is amazing! They give double miles every day with every purchase! Or the cast could say something during good nights.
 No, it has to be big enough that Liz thinks we planned it all along.
 I've got an idea! What if we Spit it out! Cast, set yourselves good night.
 Please, please set yourselves for good nights.
 Did you crash? No.
 No, but it was pretty scary.
 I mean, well, not like the stuff I saw in the Air Force, of course, like this one time a bunch of us pilots got together.
 We went to a haunted house in Germany.
 That was messed up! Today is my birthday, Carol.
 It's your birthday.
 Damn it, I Sorry.
 Happy birthday, Lizzie.
 Don't worry about it.
 I've known these dummies a lot longer, and none of them Oh, my God.
 You did remember! Wait, wait.
 What's happening there? Is that a surprise party? Surprise! I was totally in on it! It was really expensive! Happy birthday, Lemon.
 You you knew all along.
 Come on, you didn't think we'd forget your birthday, did you? Is that a polka band? Happy birthday! Wait a minute.
 Why is Henry Winkler on my cake? I like Fonzie.
 Hey! This is supposed to be for Jadwiga.
 No, everybody loves the Fonz! You stole an old cleaning lady's birthday just to try to make me happy? In my defense, yes.
 That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me! Five seconds back.
 Four, three On behalf of everyone here at "TGS," we just want to Good night! Help! Her thumbs are in my eyes! Well, I know your birthday isn't what you'd hoped, Lemon, but at least it was memorable.
 No, you know what? It was perfect.
 It was the best of both worlds.
 Oh, yeah, sorry.
 It was the best of both worlds.
 I got to feel martyred and indignant all day, and then I still got to eat cake off the floor.
 But I still have one birthday wish.
 I want you to have a drink with me.
 Well, I know Avery doesn't want me to, but it's dangerous to say no to an old spinster.
 You might turn me into a crow.
 To Liz Lemon.
 You're halfway to death.
 That's more like it.
 Thank you to Matt Damon, Rachel Dratch, Bill Hader, Jon Hamm, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Garrett Neff, Chris Parnell, everyone at NBC! "30 Rock" crew, I love you! "SNL" crew, I love you! Good night! [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Listen, Greg, I've got the next big reality show.
 We put a bunch of people on a plane, fly them over the Atlantic, then Tom Bergeron comes out and reveals that the pilot is a six year-old boy.
 We call it "Child Hell Flight.
" Get out of here! He is pitching a no-hitter! What? Starting at 4:00 p.
m.
 Yesterday, when Mr.
 Donaghy coined the word "innoventually," he has been flawless.
 So why do I have to leave? Because you have so many unsolvable problems.
 Like your mouth.
 It looks like someone kicked a hole in a bag of flour! Good news, Jonathan.
 "Child Hell Flight" will innoventually be on the spring schedule.
 Congratulations, sir! Miss Lemon was just leaving.
 No, Lemon, please come in.
 When you're pitching a perfect game, you don't walk Albert Pujols.
 And you are the Albert Pujols of having problems.
 Perfect game, huh? I haven't done a single thing wrong in almost 24 hours.
 And I'm including sex last night.
 Here's Avery's thank-you note.
 She likes that? No.
 But she respects it when it's done correctly.
 Lemon, you may be witnessing history here.
 Making it to a full 24 hours without a single misstep is called "Reaganing".
 The only other people who've ever done it? Lee lacocca, Jack Welch, and, no judgment, Saddam Hussein.
 So what have you got for me? I need to get out to Newark Airport.
 Carol's on a layover, and I really have to see him.
 You're horny and you want to get some.
 I get it.
 Ew, Jack, gross! Come on.
 I just want to see him.
 And I can't get a cab because Greece is playing Pakistan in soccer.
 Problem solved.
 I'll take you.
 Really? I'll drop you off at the airport, and then I'll swing by MSNBC.
 I have to talk to Rachel Maddow.
 Only one of us can have this haircut.
 K-Swiss, I need to cancel my gig for hosting the MTV International Video Music Awards.
 Why wasn't I invited to that? My single is number four in Japan! Choke me, choke me Blonde-like choke me I hate to bail, but I've been asked to do a commercial for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and I just can't turn down community service.
 Because if I do, that judge is gonna make me join the Coast Guard.
 Well, I also recently received an unexpected honor from the Carvel Ice Cream Corporation.
 They gave me this after I performed on their "Kidz 4-eva!" float during last year's Thanksgiving Day parade.
 Ice cream Hey, don't you want some ice cream? I don't watch the Macy's parade.
 If I want to see a 50- foot Spider-Man, I'll just go into my rec room, thank you.
 Kenneth, take this card and get a cake for the crew.
 Oh, that's very thoughtful, Ms.
 Maroney.
 Well, one of the camera guys just had a baby, and I'm sick of hearing about it.
 This will put me back on top! What's wrong, Lemon? When I see you chew your nails like that, it's either you're very anxious or you handled some ham earlier.
 When I get to the airport, I'm going to break up with Carol.
 What? Lemon, I am shocked.
 You two seemed so happy.
 The other day I saw you in the lobby laughing together.
 A guy on crutches bit it in the revolving door.
 And he was so scared! So what's the problem? You ate spaghetti in front of him? Of course not.
 He got a fungus from your shower? No.
 You had a fight about something? No, we're not fighting.
 We don't fight.
 It's just Nothing.
 I don't want to talk about it.
 Lemon, I've known you for four years.
 And in that time, I've never known you to be shy about talking about anything.
 Well, I found my first gray toeknuckle hair! If I could press a button and five people in the world would die, but I'd get free cable for life, I'd do it.
 And I'd been on the toilet so long that my legs had fallen asleep, so when I tried to stand, I just fell into my throw-up.
 There is one thing you don't like to talk about.
 Why aren't we moving? Sex, Lemon.
 Coitus.
 The beast with two backs.
 You and I have never had an adult conversation about boning.
 Fine.
 Carol and I are having an intimacy problem.
 Okay.
 So tell me what happened.
 I was visiting Carol in Las Vegas, and there was a performance issue.
 That does happen to men.
 I faced it myself with Greta Van Susteren before her head transplant.
 You know, why don't I call Carol? No, don't do that! I'm Reaganing, Lemon.
 Let me solve this.
 It's not him! It's me! I'm the one with the performance problem! What? What are you talking about? I freaked out, and my junk closed for business.
 It's like Fort Knox down there.
 I'm just going to raise the barrier if that's okey-dokey with everybody.
 It's kind of like that.
 Tracy, let me take you through the concept.
 It's all one shot.
 We start on a boy shooting a basketball, pan to some girls Double Dutching, we pass the kid who does a flip on a trampoline, follow a skateboarder who jumps the curb and whizzes past you for your line.
 What line? "Boys and Girls Clubs of America.
 Be great!" We faxed a script to someone named Grizz? Scripts get in the way of my process, Shawn.
 Let's just shoot a hundred of these and see what we get.
 Here's your cake, Ms.
 Maroney! Let's see! "Jenny?" That's not my name! I don't want Wheelchair Jenny from Accounting getting credit for my cake! Take it back to Carvel.
 But then they'll just throw it out.
 So? I know food's plentiful around here, Ms.
 Maroney, but back home on our pig farm, times are tough.
 We've had to sell off Sally, Julie, and Poppy.
 Are those some of your pigs? Yes.
 Take the cake back, Kenneth.
 You know, your little problem makes sense, Lemon.
 You have more sexual hang-ups than an adult chat line run by Gilbert Gottfried.
 What? That was written by a computer program we're working on to replace you.
 No, I don't have hang-ups.
 You don't think you're a bit of a prude? A little squeamish and conservative? Sex always makes things worse.
 Jack, why don't you just say you want some Is that sex, Lemon? It is the way I do it.
 We are lovers.
 Oh, that word bums me out unless it's between the words "meat" and "pizza.
" She likes that? Okay, fine.
 Maybe I'm a little old-fashioned.
 I'm sorry I'm a real woman and not some oversexed New York nympho like those sluts on "Everybody Loves Raymond".
 Wow.
 This may be the greatest challenge a potential Reaganer has ever faced.
 I'm going to fix you and save your relationship with Carol.
 I don't need to be "fixed".
 Has it happened before? Yes.
 With my college boyfriend, Joel Sucheki.
 A couple times with Dennis.
 And now Carol.
 There has to be a root cause.
 Maybe from your past.
 There isn't, Jack.
 There has to be something.
 Go deep! You think I haven't thought about this? There's nothing! Dig! Dig down! Dive into the sexual abyss! Stop it, Jack! Stop it! Stop asking about the roller skates! And action! What's my cue? You know what, it doesn't matter.
 I don't know my lines! Cut! Tracy, we're causing a huge traffic jam.
 We're causing a huge traffic jam while getting paid to make dreams! We're the luckiest people on earth! Now, someone get me a Jolt Cola! It does not exist anymore! Here's the money back from Carvel, Ms.
 Maroney.
 $23.
94.
 Hang on, she gave you cash? Oh, yes.
 I'm sorry.
 I told the girl I didn't have your card so She must have thought you meant credit card.
 How many cashiers are at that store? Two! This is fun! Oh, my God.
 We can run the short grift on this.
 It's been years since my mom and I used to pull slip-and-falls at supermarkets.
 I thought I was done with that life, but this is too good.
 We can pull an Arizona double-back on them, Kenneth! I don't understand what you're saying, but I like that it has the word "we" in it! I'd like to order a cake that reads "Happy Birthday, Blenna.
" "Blenna"? Yes.
 I'm sorry, Miss, but there's been a mistake with this cake.
 And I'm afraid I don't have the card.
 Okay.
 I'm sorry.
 I'll just give you cash back.
 I need a "Happy Blirthday, Jennica" cake.
 Yes, "Bappy Hirthday, Gremlin".
 Lemon.
 What do you want to tell me about the roller skates? Why are we not moving? What is causing this traffic jam? I'm sorry, I have an erection.
 I think it's the sound of the skateboard.
 We're going again! Everybody safely back to one! Let me help you.
 I am unstoppable today.
 If it'll make it any easier, imagine you're telling your story to Reagan himself.
 Well, Liz, will you tell the Gipper your sexual story? Mommy? I was nine years old.
 I was rollerskating in the house, which was absolutely forbidden.
 I was skating down the hallway, on top of the world with my new skates and my new haircut, which everybody thought was a Dorothy Hamill but was actually a Pete Rose.
 Anyway, I needed to go to the bathroom.
 But the door was locked.
 My recently divorced aunt had moved in with us, and I was sharing a bathroom with her.
 To be prepared, I tried to take my underpants off over my roller skates.
 I slipped, and as I fell, I pulled down this poster of the singer Tom Jones that my aunt had put up.
 My mom heard the noise and ran and found me squirming under the Tom Jones poster with my underpants around my ankles.
 It didn't look good, Jack.
 She thought I did it on purpose.
 And she didn't say a word.
 She just went in my room and took all my posters.
 Grizzly Adams.
 Larry Wilcox.
 Han Solo.
 Tug McGraw.
 Mike Schmidt.
 Kermit.
 Gunther Gebel-Williams! She took all the people away, Jack! Sex makes the people go away! I'm going to go see what's up with this traffic.
 Oh, here's your money back, Ma'am.
 Boy, they sure are making a lot of mistakes over there today.
 Do you really not understand what we're doing? Of course I do.
 We're standing here, talking.
 Adding brick after brick to our friendship castle so it someday reaches the sky! With Carvel, Kenneth.
 We're conning them.
 I'm ordering messed up cakes and getting them free with my card.
 Then you're returning them for cash.
 We're selling back free cakes! But, Ms.
 Maroney, that's wrong.
 And illegal.
 If Cookie Puss knew, he'd tear us apart with his fangs! Well, here's your cut.
 We're not hurting anybody.
 Carvel's got plenty of money.
 But Shh.
 I need a partner to pull this off, and think of all the good you can do with that money back home.
 They do need help.
 And with enough money, they could buy those magic beans from that old hermit.
 We'd be rich! Take the money, Kenneth.
 No one will ever know.
 Shirt on or off, Shawn? On! Good note.
 Back to one! Hey, Jackie D! Let's take a quick 500 so everybody can meet Jack! You know him? Please help me get his line! Fix this! No.
 I don't need any more problems to solve.
 Especially not him! I am the Sisyphus of Reaganing.
 Yeah, that's the kind of stuff I should be saying! It's in my head now.
 Let's roll! I'm sorry, jellybeans.
 I know how much the Gipper liked you, and I've failed him.
 It's funny, I remember George Shultz telling me how, later in Reagan's presidency, when his mind was resting, how they would use jellybeans to convince people that he was That's it! I know how to fix Tracy! Make him eat these.
 I'll take care of the rest.
 Boys and Girls Clubs of America.
 Be Great! Oh, my God, we got it! I'm on my way, Liz Lemon! Make way, I'm Reaganing.
 Don't you worry.
 I'm sending you some money so you can get your operation.
 Now can you put a human on the phone? Hello? Well, Kenneth, it's over.
 I got made at Carvel.
 They figured out our scam and gave me this.
 What? No! Sorry, it's the short grift.
 You've got to walk away.
 We can't stop now! My family needs money.
 But they're on to us! I have another idea for a long con.
 Kenneth, I know your intentions are good, but I don't like what this is doing to you.
 You seem meaner and stronger, and what if you got a motorcycle and we did it on it? Are you in or not? What's the angle? Who else was on that Thanksgiving float with you? One last long grift, huh? Okay, I'm in.
 But one rule: Anybody gets hurt during the score, we leave them behind to die.
 Now, who are you and what are we doing? That cake is worth $40! There's so much we can do with that.
 Liz wrote this sketch before she left.
 Ice cream cake-eating contest? Okay, we'll gonna need about 20 cakes for this.
 I'll tell Props.
 No, Pete.
 I'll tell Props.
 Okay.
 Good afternoon.
 I would like 21 cakes that read "Frajer Reunion 2010".
 Isn't it "Frasier"? No, it's "Frajer".
 And I should know.
 I'm Frajer.
 I mean, "Frajer"? Come on.
 I should throw some tossed salad and scrambled eggs at you! Frajer! No! Frajer! We sold the cakes twice! You're a genius, Kenneth.
 $800 split three ways.
 Those ice cream saps will rue the day they ever tangled with the Best Friends Gang! Lemon! Why did you leave? I'm trying to help you! You can't help me! No one can! I'm fixing you and I'm saving your relationship.
 I can do it.
 Look, sex is a beautiful, natural, and joyful part of our shared human experience Hey! You two want to party? Now is not a good time, Miss.
 It's $20 for a party, $60 to bite me during it.
 I'll do stuff with a dog, but I get to pick the dog.
 People want that? This is not helping! You wanna watch me be with her? Me with you? Me and both of you without my leg? Thank you.
 Just take this and move along.
 You two are pretty uptight for hanging out under a bridge.
 Sex is horrible! What is it? It's 4:00, sir! You did it! A day of perfect problem solving! Gifts have been coming in all afternoon.
 It's 4:00? And you fixed me, so Yay! Send everything back.
 What? Why? I didn't do it.
 I failed.
 It's her, isn't it? Sorry.
 I hate her, sir! Stupid Cookie Puss! Are you all right, Miss? I just got fired 'cause Kelsey Grammer scammed me! Forget trying to go straight, I'm going back to working under that bridge! I know.
 That's good.
 Kenneth, we've got a new con.
 We're gonna go go down to Florida, open a medical supply store, then get Social Security numbers Through seduction! I'm sorry, Sir-Ma'am.
 I'm out.
 What? Why? Because Ms.
 Maroney was wrong.
 People did get hurt by our actions.
 And, yes, my family sure could use a couple hundred more dollars, but it's not right.
 A couple hundred dollars, huh? I think I can help you out.
 But I'm gonna need 50 to get started.
 Kelsey, no.
 I'm proud of you, Kenneth.
 You've got a good heart.
 I hope you get into a car accident someday so I can have it.
 Now there's only one thing left to do.
 Beat you out of the Best Friends Gang.
 Well, it's been a pretty rough day, but at least we're in Newark now.
 What are you going to do about Carol? I'm gonna break up with him, let him off the hook.
 That would be a mistake, Lemon.
 Yes, you are the sexual equivalent of a million Hindenburgs, but you deserve someone like Carol in your life, and he deserves you.
 Because, and I'm only going to say this once a decade, you're great.
 You're Liz Lemon, dammit.
 In certain lights you're an eight using East Coast over-35 standards excluding Miami.
 Thanks, Jack.
 You go in there, you grab Carol, you take him into one of those unisex family bathrooms, pull down that diaper-changing thing, and go to town on him! I'll try.
 But if I couldn't get it done in Vegas after a Penn and Teller show, I don't know how it's going to happen here.
 Wait a minute.
 You had your problem with Carol in Las Vegas.
 So? The Tom Jones poster.
 Tom Jones plays Vegas all the time.
 He has billboards everywhere.
 No kidding.
 There was one right outside our hotel room window.
 Oh, my God.
 Think back to your college boyfriend.
 Was there any? Yes! When this happened with Joel, "What's new, pussycat?" Was playing on the bus we were on I mean, the room we were in! And when it happened with Dennis, he had just gotten a perm! Tom Jones is the trigger! He makes you remember your mother taking the people away! Does this mean I'm fixed? Oh, God no! You've got years of therapy ahead of you.
 Probably electroshock.
 But this is a breakthrough, Lemon, and a big one.
 Jack Donaghy, in my book, you're better than Reagan! I appreciate that, Lemon, but if you ever speak ill of Reagan again, I will smack those teeth straight.
 U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! He's at JFK! I wrote it down wrong! How was the sex? Fast and only on Saturdays.
 It's perfect.
 I have been sexually rejected by not one, but two guys who later went to clown college.
 And one time in summer camp I kissed a girl on a dare, but then she drowned.
 He was the first gay guy I ever kissed.
 Standing up, what? How does that even work? You haven't had sex? Shh.
 We have, of course, pleasured one another.
 No, stop.
 I believe Oh, stop saying "relationship.
" I'm sorry, I was going to say "climax.
" [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			I know I'm jumping the gun a bit, but I had this made for the baby at Hermès.
 So she can ride the maid.
 It is adorable.
 But are we still in love with the name Charlotte? I think so.
 Why do you ask? "Charlotte"? Are you serious? Well, Lemon went to middle school with a Charlotte who used to rub herself against a tree during recess I want to know why you would ever tell Lemon something so personal! I know that my relationship with Lemon may seem strange, but I'm her mentor.
 And the Donaghy Mentoring Experience is immersive.
 There need to be boundaries.
 That woman is your employee.
 No, she's more than that.
 I don't choose my mentees lightly.
 They have to have the drive and ambition to be worth my time.
 The intelligence to understand the challenges they're going face.
 The humility to accept my help.
 And finally, a life that is a bottomless swamp of chaos.
 Drive, Intelligence, Humility, Chaos.
 Or the acronym "DIHC".
 I'm looking for DIHC, Avery, and I'm going to take it wherever I can find it.
 It's been four years, Jack.
 Maybe it's time for Liz to graduate.
 Maybe it's time for you to carry this baby! And maybe you and Liz can raise it Oh, no, crazy hormone swing! Why does everything smell like onions? Lemon.
 Boundaries.
 Got it.
 In here you can see one of NBC's editing bays.
 Tracy Jordan, the star of "TG S" and numerous films, has died No! No, it can't be! I'm not done with him, Jacob! He stays on this side! Kenneth, Tracy's not dead.
 NBC News makes obituaries for celebrities to have them ready.
 They're just updating Tracy's to include his recent submarine DUI.
 Oh, thank goodness.
 Say, do you think I could get a copy of that to show Mr.
 Jordan? That way he can see his own funeral just like Tom Sawyer! Tom's a fellow from my town we accidentally buried alive.
 Funny story, after we dug him back up, he tried to kill all of us! Hello? Hey, Liz, it's your father, Dick Lemon.
 Dad, you don't have to say your name every time.
 Telephone etiquette is important, Liz.
 It lets people know your race even when they can't see you.
 Anyway, you got a busy week? Not really.
 I was gonna take a class called "Cooking for One", but the teacher killed himself.
 Well, what about a visit? Really? That would be great! With you and Mom here, the doormen will have to eat their words about me never having friends over! Well, it'll just be me this time, Elizabeth.
 Your mother isn't coming.
 What? You and Mom always travel together.
 Well, she's not coming this time.
 I just want to have a little fun by myself.
 Can't a guy have a little fun? What is wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Your mother's home.
 This conversation never happened.
 What the what? I am a Jedi! Tracy Jordan, star of the "Fat Bitch" movies, was also voted Worst Representation of a Black Man 9 years in a row.
 Perhaps best known for his F C C fines.
 Diabetes.
 Thank God I didn't anybody.
 And thank God I didn't some And giving the Queen parvo This is terrible! When I'm dead, that's what I'll leave behind? That's how my grandkids will remember me as they fly around in their jetpacks? Well, it's not fair out of context.
 Her Highness was sending signals It doesn't matter.
 That's how the world sees me.
 As some idiot millionaire! Who, Mark Cuban? That guy ran me over with a jet ski! What is he so upset about? It's my fault.
 I let Mr.
 Jordan see his obituary He's dying? Fine, I'll sing at his funeral.
 No, Ma'am, NBC News makes celebrity obituaries ahead of time.
 Typical liberal media.
 They do? Well, then, I need to see mine.
 If they used any of the footage from my shoplifting arrest, that would be great because my arms looked fantastic! Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? My Dad just called and Lemon, I'm sorry.
 If this is about a personal matter, we can't discuss it.
 What? Why? It's Avery.
 She's going to be my wife someday, and, understandably, the nature of our relationship is a little confusing to her.
 Ooh, she feels threatened.
 It must be my sessuality.
 Bacause I am so very sessual.
 You like that? And maybe Avery is a little emotional these days.
 She's put on considerable boob weight.
 She's not used to that and sometimes she just falls over.
 It's stressful.
 But she might have a point about us.
 Maybe it isn't appropriate for you to still come to me with every little problem in your life.
 Oh.
 Okay.
 Great.
 Fine.
 I'll solve my own problems.
 Blammo! Solved it! What do you mean I don't have an obituary? I'm Jenna Maroney.
 I played Arts and Literature in the film adaptation of "Trivial Pursuit".
 I know who you are, Ms.
 Maroney.
 But you're not on the list.
 They only make obits for people they think are, you know, important Like who? "Kim Jong-lll"? I never heard of her.
 I should be on here! You wanted to see me, sir? Jonathan, I may be in the market for a new young person to mentor Oh, my God! Sir, I have dreamed of this moment.
 But my fear is that you don't have enough ambition.
 The drive to deserve my mentorship.
 No, sir.
 There's nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you.
 My attorney is waiting in his office.
 He will present you with a contract to become my mentee if you bring him my pinky.
 No, sir! Then you wouldn't be perfect anymore! I won't do it! Exactly.
 I knew that you wouldn't No, watch! I'll cut off my pinky! And tell him it's yours! Jonathan.
 Ambition is the willingness to kill the things you love and eat them in order to stay alive.
 Haven't you ever read my throw pillow? Dad! Hi, sweetheart.
 Where are your glasses? And what's with that shirt? I don't need my glasses.
 And this is an Edward Hardy shirt.
 A very hip Latino-sounding blur at Mervyn's said I looked good in it.
 Dad, what are you doing? You're traveling alone, you show up here looking like you've been on spring break for 300 years, and earlier, Mom called and told me to give you a hug before your colonoscopy.
 Uh-oh! Dad, look at me.
 What is going on? Honey, there's no easy way to say it.
 Your mother and I are taking a little break.
 A break? After 45 years? Honey, it's complicated.
 We're having problems.
 Really? Does Mom know you're having problems? 'Cause she thinks you're at the doctor.
 Your mother and I don't laugh like we used to.
 I don't know what happened.
 Where has my best friend gone? Ugh! What are you talking about? You're just pretending like there's some big problem so you can come up here and what? Try to pick up women? You think they won't notice you're 80 because you took your glasses off? I will not be spoken to this way, young lady.
 You know what? You're not staying here during your little "time-out".
 Your Gentleman's Intermission.
 Go to a hotel.
 Or better yet, go home to Mom! Fine, I don't need you.
 I'm meeting up with my old army buddy, Gary.
 Tonight we're doing a push-up, and tomorrow we're going to a bar called Swingles! Gary's wife just died a couple of days ago, and he hasn't returned the hospital bed yet so I can sleep there! Now, where's the door? I'm not telling! Cold.
 That's why you need your glasses.
 Colder.
 It's zip.
 Hello? Hey, girl! What do you want, Liz? Look, I know I shouldn't be calling, but my Dad's in town "taking a break" from being married.
 It's a Gentleman's Intermission.
 And you want to talk about this with your boss? Well, when you put it like that, with the mean voice and all Good night, Liz.
 What's wrong, Tray? Why are you sitting in your sadness spotlight? I've seen my NBC News obituary, Jackie D.
 I looked like a fool in it.
 Well, certainly, you can't be surprised that there's a lot of negative stuff about you out there.
 Don't you ever Google yourself? Sure.
 I Google myself all the time.
 Like if Angie's not in the mood, or I'm alone in a hotel.
 Tracy, you do know that "Googling yourself" means looking yourself up on the Internet? I did not know that.
 That explains why Liz Lemon was so cool the other day.
 Liz Lemon, you mind if I Google myself in your office? Sure, Tracy.
 Can I use your computer? How else are you going to do it? Tracy, you're someone with a lot of problems who needs constant guidance.
 And don't forget, I never listen.
 If you're open to it, I'm very good at giving advice.
 For example, your obit problem.
 You've spent years creating a certain public image.
 But you can change that.
 You just have to do what Prince Hal did.
 Who's Prince Hal? From "Henry IV".
 You played him in Central Park last summer.
 I don't know any of my lines! Everyone thought Prince Hal was a drunken wastrel.
 But when he became King, he transformed himself into a wise and just ruler.
 He changed the headline.
 That's what you have to do, Tracy.
 You know something, Jackie D, that thing I said earlier about Prince Hal got me thinking.
 I have to change my headline! Yes.
 That's what I just said.
 Now, if I can help you No, no, no, Jackie D.
 I don't need your help.
 I'm Tracy Jordan.
 When I go to sleep, nothing happens in the world! He failed the test of humility.
 I cannot be his mentor.
 Well, I'd love for you to be my mentor, sir, but unfortunately I already have one.
 Stop calling me! Okay, what would Jack tell me to do? First, he'd probably explain that evolution makes men promiscuous, even when they're 80 like my pathetic dad.
 Is your dad "pathetic" or is he maybe on some level admirable? Maybe his sons would respect him more as a man.
 Maybe they'd stop calling him a "bald wang" in front of the babysitter.
 Can you imagine Dick Lemon at a singles bar? It makes me want to barf.
 Ugh, those old men hitting on you at clubs are so lame.
 "Lame" or is it "heroic"? Why can't they see how idiotic they look? With guys like that I always just say, "Who's younger? Me or your daughter?" That usually creeps them out enough that they leave.
 That wouldn't work on me.
 Jack, why does Tracy have a News obit and I don't? Huh.
 I never thought of you for the Donaghy Mentoring Experience.
 But you are an unceasing onslaught of dysfunction.
 Dr.
 Drew called me "unfixable".
 Let's think this through.
 You don't have an obit because you haven't done as much as Tracy has.
 His movies gross millions, his comedy albums go platinum, and he owns the world's only giraffe basketball team, the New York Necks.
 So your problem My problem? NBC News has the problem! I don't think that's right And you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna make my own obituary and show them how wrong they are! Then, I'm afraid you're on your own, Jenna.
 You have failed the test of intelligence.
 Oh, really? Well, so are you! Hello, Lemon.
 Hey, Jack.
 How's business things? I made several overseas phone calls today.
 I'm doing great.
 Like the song, I'm "taking on my business.
" No, it's Right.
 Forget it.
 Shoulders back, Lemon.
 You're not welcoming people to Castle Frankenstein.
 I can't read any of this, Gary, can you? Give us this third thing.
 Uh, hello, Miss.
 My name is Ricky.
 I'm Dorothy Michaels.
 And you don't look stupid in that shirt at all.
 What do you gentlemen do? We work for the FBI.
 Female Body Inspectors.
 Tell me, was your father a donkey herder because that ass No, my father worked for Philadelphia Power and Light! It's me, your daughter! Elizabeth Lemon! Elizabeth? What are you doing? Ugh! This woman's trying to hit on her own father? No, no, good people of Swingles! Hear me out! My married 80-year-old father is taking a "Gentleman's Intermission" That's a great name for what I'm doing! Just what are you trying to accomplish with this stunt, young lady? I am trying to show you how disgusting you are! No, you're the disgusting one! Yeah! That was a terrible plan! Come on, Gary.
 Let's go hit that bar with the cool rainbow flags! A two-time CableACE Award nominee and three-time Tony Shalhoub sex partner, Jenna Maroney is perhaps best remembered for being beautiful.
 Jenna Maroney, dead at 32.
 Jenna, you ripped through our lives Like the passing of the wind Read back what we have so far.
 "Ideas to change Mr.
 Jordan's headline.
" Then you said, "Read back what we have so far.
" Why is this so hard? All I want to do is turn into a worldwide hero overnight.
 Coming up in our next half-hour, we're going to meet a heroic cat who saved its owner's life by dialing 9-1-1.
 What an amazing story! That cat's a hero.
 If I save it, I'm a double hero! Ken, I need your help.
 I actually have an important church Denied.
 Hey, what's going on? I got a message you wanted to see me.
 Yes.
 I know you're interviewing John Boehner later.
 You should know he has very tiny hands so let him hold a miniature golf scoring pencil to make them look normal.
 Obviously.
 Why are you? Oh, my God! Are you trying to mentor me? All right, calm down I am squared away, Donaghy.
 I get four hours of sleep a night, eat 1,200 calories a day, and my closet has been on the cover of "Organized Living".
 Twice.
 Damn it.
 I knew you'd fail the test of chaos.
 Is it really that difficult to find someone new to mentor? It's impossible.
 I would never say this to her face, but Lemon is above average.
 She's got just the right amount of DIHC for me.
 I hear it, and I don't care! I've cast a wide net, but even the junior executives here There's something wrong with this generation.
 Hey, are you Jack? Sorry I'm late.
 BT Dubbs, I gotta leave for my ironic kickball league in about ten.
 Also I'm not interested in this position unless I'm gonna be constantly praised.
 And I won't cut my hair.
 It's go time, Ken.
 You ready? I've got my hammer.
 I've got my mask.
 You just stop me before I get to that cat.
 I'll be right behind you! And finally, the weekend bo x office crown belonged to the indie darling "Hard to Watch" Critics have been praising the gritty drama and the performance of its star, Tracy Jordan.
 Now, not to editorialize, but if Jordan doesn't win the Oscar, that would be the stupidest thing since the following segue.
 Speaking of cats An Oscar? If I win an Oscar, everyone will have to respect me! My obituary will read "Oscar winner" instead of "children's soccer heckler".
 It would change my headline! I feel like I'm forgetting something.
 I left Tracy Jr.
 In Atlantic City! Die, hero cat! I hate you! I said I'm going to kill that cat! Killing cats is wrong unless it's to make a hat! My skull! Jenna Maroney just saved the hero cat! And that makes me a double hero! Try to deny me an obit now, you jags! And tell people in lieu of flowers, they can pour jewels into my open coffin! I'm very injured.
 You wanted to see me? No, Lemon I did.
 Albino ninja! Look, I never should never have interfered with whatever this is.
 Work husband-slash-uncle.
 Co-worker-slash-little brother.
 Right, well, she's not ready to move on.
 It's true.
 I'm wearing a Duane Reade bag as underwear today.
 All right.
 And, for whatever reason, he needs you, too.
 It's a symbiotic relationship.
 I'm a mighty great white shark, Lemon, and you, are a remora, clinging to me with your suction cup head.
 I give you a free ride and, in exchange, you eat my parasites.
 I'm gonna leave you two alone.
 I already briefed him on your problem.
 The Gentleman's Intermission, yes.
 Lemon, does your father have a cell phone? Yes.
 Jack is back! If anyone can talk sense into my dad, it's you.
 Oh, no.
 I'm not going to "talk sense" into anybody.
 Your father is being irrational, and irrational behavior doesn't respond to rationality.
 It responds to fear.
 Hello? Yeah, is this Dick Lemon? This is he.
 Who's calling? I'm Tricia's boyfriend, you scumbag! She told me what happened with yous last night, and now I'm gonna come and find you and gonna kick your ass so hard, you're gonna be throwing up my toenails! No, no, no, no, no! There's been a mistake! I did not do anything with anyone last night, certainly not a Tricia! Oh, now you're telling me my Tricia's not good enough for you? She's an angel! I'll tell you what? I'm getting my brothers, and we're coming over there, and we're gonna kick your Dick Lemon speaking.
 How dare you hang up on me? I'm a corrupt cop! My brother's a corrupt fireman! He's gonna set you on fire, and I am not gonna investigate it! That won't be necessary.
 I'm leaving for Philadelphia today! Dick, listen, Tricia told me you're married.
 I know that men are meant to be promiscuous because of evolution, but you made a commitment to a woman you love.
 I do! I do love her! Yeah, that's right.
 You're a lucky man.
 A, because you have a family.
 And B, that I have not curb-stomped you in front of your grandchildren! Actually, I don't have grandchildren.
 Why not? Tricia told me you have a 40-year-old daughter.
 What's wrong with her? Okay.
 I gotta go.
 I'm taking Trisha to Laser Zeppelin.
 You take care now.
 Go Necks! Can I show you a weird thing on my leg? Yeah.
 That's got to be removed.
 "Claire"? "Claire"? "Joanne"? Okay! Well, I look forward to visiting her and her wife on their farm.
 "Jacqueline"? Like, named after you? Like a little Jack, but with boobs? Hi, I'm Daphne Donaghy.
 I saw a turtle! "Kylie", great.
 She can strip her way through community college.
 Come on! I don't know about "Christina".
 'Cause then everybody calls her "Tina", and every Tina I've known is a real judgmental bitch.
 [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			How's it going in there? Great.
 Trying on jeans is my favorite thing.
 Maybe later I can get a Pap smear from an old male doctor.
 Come on, Liz, this is store is cool.
 It's huge with all the young people.
 I mean, all the us! This place is trying way too hard.
 Why are there straitjackets on everywhere? Because before this was a clothing store, it was a mental hospital.
 It's winky and fun, Liz! Okay, I tried them on.
 Can we go now? Liz Lemon, you look hot! Really? I swear to Kabbalah Monster, those jeans are perfect.
 Look at your butt! Oh, my God.
 Is that me? Liz, it's the dream.
 Boy on the bottom, girl on the top! O-M-God.
 Those jeans are 'zing! This online slang dictionary says it's short for "amazing"! Or it's a club drug made from a tooth whitener.
 Either way you win! I'll wear these jeans out, and I'll take 10 more pairs! 'Tastic.
 Shall I put the pants you had on in with the jeans? No, burn them.
 Burn them! I'm sorry I was late this morning, sir.
 I was attacked in my apartment.
 Quiet! Why are they talking about that woman?  making political hay out of the wheatfield that is the NB C-Kable Town merger Who wrote this? Jared, honestly? Bookman told reporters, quote, "The merger of NB C and Kable Town is bad for the consumer.
 I don't trust their executive leadership.
 And Kable Town still has an auxiliary button on their remote.
 What is that for? It just makes the screen go blue.
" Why is she still talking about the merger? She said I had three months to make NBC more diverse! It's not your fault nobody watched "America's Next Top Black Guy".
 Bookman amping up the rhetoric in a tight race.
 Polls have her in a dead heat with out-of-nowhere challenger Steven Austin.
 Wait a second.
 There's a chance she could lose? Bookman is obviously holding a gun to my head.
 And no matter what I do, she obviously wants me to fail.
 But if she loses This isn't a conversation! But if she loses, I won't have to worry about her scuttling the merger.
 Jonathan, get her opponent in here.
 Whoever he is, he just made a very powerful friend.
 I thought you said you didn't need any more friends.
 'Zing leg-tubes, Liz! Vunderhinder! They're from Brooklyn Without Limits.
 It's a very cool store with locations in Gaytown, White Harlem, and the Van Beardswick section of Brooklyn! And they don't just look great.
 See the tag? Handmade in USA.
 Because BWL is all about fair trade and local artisans and staying green.
 These jeans totally make up for all the times I took a long, hot shower because I was bored.
 I'm so excited for you, Liz.
 Now we both have amazing butts! Make that all three of us! Jenna, a word.
 Specifically the word "talking".
 Oh, and look at this.
 J-train.
 As you may know, I was in a film called "Hard to Watch".
 And the "pundits" think I have a "chance" at an "Oscar", and I "just learned" about "air-quotes".
 Yes, I talked about your movie with my therapist last week for 20 hours.
 I know this is difficult for you I'm fine.
 Talking with Dr.
 Linda helped me realize I have just as much going on in my life.
 My exercise video is dropping soon.
 It's called "Jenna Gets Hard".
 Well, if you're okay talking about it, I need your help.
 These reporters want to come do a story on me.
 They're from something called the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
 Huffpah? Yeah.
 That's the Golden Globes, the second most important awards in Hollywood after the People's Choice Awards! Where the fans are in charge! So what do you think I should do? You could have a special screening for them, host a luncheon, and when the time is right Be bad at snapping.
 Got it.
 No, Tracy.
 You could try to bribe them.
 I mean, a Golden Globe is a stepping stone to an Oscar.
 How bad do you want it? I'm not an expert at morality, but isn't that wrong? You're asking me? So this is the man who's going to bring down Regina Bookman.
 Rhode Island's own Steven Austin.
 Actually, I go by Steve Austin.
 That way, people see my name on ballots, they think I'm the wrestler, and they vote for me.
 I've been reading up on you, Steve.
 Honestly, I want to like you.
 But I see that you're not affiliated with the Republican party.
 The party system's broken, Jack.
 I don't believe in parties.
 I don't join them, and I never get invited to them.
 Hint, hint.
 You're an individual.
 A maverick.
 People like you are succeeding because Americans are fed up with the status quo.
 Exactly! They're tired of the direction this country's heading in.
 They want to return to our past glory.
 They want an American Renaissance! I like what I'm hearing, Steve.
 Then you'll love the sound of this! Goo-goo, ga-ga, Jack.
 What's that? The theme of my campaign.
 "Renaissance" means "rebirth".
 I want to usher in the rebirth of this country.
 That's why the theme of all my campaign commercials is, "I'm a baby!" This country has lost its way.
 We need to start over and return to what made our nation great.
 My name is Steve Austin, and I'm a lifelong resident of Rhode Island and the manager of a local paintball facility.
 I will clean up Washington like it's the bathroom of a paintball facility.
 Vote Steve Austin! And if you're blind, I am the wrestler! Right.
 I like a lot of what you're saying, Steve.
 But before I throw my support behind you, I do have a litmus test.
 Okay.
 Can I take that in two weeks? No, it's just questions.
 What do you think the role of government should be? Limited.
 I believe in small government.
 Excellent answer.
 Or no government at all.
 If it works in Antarctica, why can't it work here? But if we have to have a government, make it as small as possible.
 Dwarves, tiny buildings, pizza bagels for lunch.
 Maybe we should stop at "small government".
 Let's cut to the chase.
 I need you to assure me you would never allow the government to interfere with the sale of one company to another.
 Of course not.
 The government shouldn't interfere in anything.
 What happens inside a man's own rain poncho at a minor league baseball game is his own business.
 Well, Steve, we should stop talking before I change my mind.
 But I do want to host a fundraiser for you.
 So give me a couple of days to put it together.
 I need to know that you believe in my message, Jack.
 Take the rattle.
 Say "Goo-goo, ga-ga", Jack.
 Goo-goo, ga-ga.
 What's going on here? I'm helping Tracy plan for a Golden Globes event tomorrow.
 Kenneth is our human sushi platter, and I'm doing a dry run so everything will be perfect.
 For my friend Tracy.
 Lying perfectly still reminds me of hiding under our porch during a Hill People rampage.
 On the day, Kenneth's mouth will be filled with wasabi so he don't do so much I should get a chafing dish and fill it with my underwear in case some Saudi guys show up.
 Let me get this straight.
 You, the person who is still jealous of the attention Baby Jessica got, are helping Tracy win an award for acting.
 Oh, I'm helping him, all right.
 I even gave him the idea to try to bribe them.
 And he's going to do that? That's awful.
 I trust award shows.
 They tell me how much to care about different dead people.
 It's not going to work.
 If they could be bribed, I would have won a Golden Globe for my Lifetime original movie "Sister, Can You Spare a Breast?" So you've tried this before? And they were so offended, they banned me for life.
 And the same thing will happen to Tracy.
 So you're sabotaging him.
 Just like I did to my niece when she tried to sing at our family's Christmas party.
 You know what? You and Tracy deserve each other.
 I don't know which of you to be more disappointed in.
 Me, silly! I'm more aware of what I'm doing! I'm sorry, Miss.
 Do you know where Liz Lemon Good God! Lemon, those jeans make you look like a Mexican sports reporter! Thank you, Jack.
 Hi, do I know you from outside the bagel store? You probably know me from the future where I am the President of the United States.
 Steve Austin, Rhode Island's independent candidate for Congress.
 Oh, yeah.
 Somebody forwarded me one of your campaign ads.
 The rebirth of America starts now.
 My name is Steve Austin, and if you're senile, yes, I am the Six-Million-Dollar Man! Paid for by the broken vending machine at the paintball place.
 I'm actually working with Steve's campaign, and I would like you to produce a biographical video for a fundraiser I'm hosting.
 Oh, my God! I got a Zappos box coming today, and there's nobody there to pick it up because my wife left me for my twin brother.
 Can I use your phone? Yeah, okay.
 You don't have a cell phone? Yeah, I got a cell phone.
 I walk around all day with a CIA tracking device in my pocket.
 Okay, that guy is bananas.
 Obviously he should not be in Congress.
 What are you doing? He's running against Regina Bookman.
 I need him.
 Uh-huh.
 So you're putting one more nut job yeah, I said it, "one more", I'm political in Washington so you can advance your career? What is going on today? Has everyone lost their moral compass? You're being awfully high and mighty for someone who once claimed her husband drowned so she could get out of a gym contract.
 The whole KableTown deal is resting on this, and Austin is pro-business.
 Big business is what's screwing up this country.
 Please, Lemon.
 You work for General Electric.
 Technically, I am a freelancer, which is pretty much a modern-day cowboy.
 And I live like a cowboy by buying quality, locally-made jeans.
 Also by eating beans out of a can, due to impatience.
 You're on your own here, partner.
 But, hey, it's not all bad, 'cause you get to watch me walk away.
 No.
 No, that's not right.
 Why can't the delivery guy just leave it out back? Yeah, I know it's not a house, but I sleep there! I'd like to thank you all for coming.
 We've heard complaints about the sushi platter moving, and we're working on it.
 I'm sorry.
 Tracy would be happy to take any softball questions you have.
 Like the following.
 What films inspire you? Well, definitely the foreign films.
 Like the political ones where you think there'll be no boobies, and then, bam! Boobies! Tracy, what is an actor? I think the better question is, "What isn't an actor?" A lamp, a couch, that mirror, or a hidden pistol, an actor And now, amidst a day of wonders, one wonder more.
 A special voters only screening of "Hard to Watch" based on the book "Stone Cold Bummer" by Manipulate.
 They call New York the Big Apple.
 Never seemed that way to me.
 I used to have dreams.
 I was an All-City running back, and I was gonna run out of here to college.
 The suburbs.
 Now the only thing I use a football for is as a toilet.
 Funny thing to happen to a guy named Lucky.
 I am a constitutional originalist, and I believe our Founding Fathers had it right.
 We need to get back to their America.
 No paved roads, rum used as an anesthetic, legalized slavery.
 All right.
 Some good pieces.
 Jack, do you want to see my hand gestures? I have You Listen to Me.
 Forceful Conclusion.
 There's work to be done.
 Hand me that shovel so I can dig a grave for her.
 Okay, let's cut! Sir, look at this Bookman photo op! "Representative Bookman greets young voters at the Warwick mall.
" She's courting the youth vote? That means she's desperate.
 My generation never votes! It interferes with talking about ourselves all the time! She's running scared.
 God, this could work.
 Now all I have to do is whip Austin into shape.
 Hey, Jack.
 Just to have options, should we do a couple takes with Binky? Let's take five! Wow.
 You're really going ahead with this? Lemon, I'm not about to take criticism from someone wearing that t-shirt.
 Hey, don't talk down Brooklyn Without Limits.
 Stores like this are saving the world.
 Really? You're going to lecture me about big business again? Do you know who owns Brooklyn Without Limits? Brooklyn Zack.
 He throws pool parties in dumpsters.
 Halliburton.
 In the mid-'90s, they found themselves with a surplus of canvas waterboarding hoods.
 So they had sweatshops make them into messenger bags to sell to outer-borough idiots.
 You don't know what you're talking about.
 "Handmade in USA.
" Your magic jeans are from BWL? Oh, Lemon.
 It's not "Handmade in USA.
" It's pronounced "Hond-made in Oosa.
" The Hand people are a Vietnamese slave tribe and Usa is their island prison.
 They made your jeans.
 Do you know how they get the stitching so small? Orphans.
 No.
 Brooklyn Zack is real! He just got back from Peru where he met a family that's been making hats for 2,000 years! We all make our compromises.
 At least I'm doing it for our company.
 For jobs.
 You're doing it for your ass.
 I don't believe you! The liberal media would have told me about this! There's no such thing.
 The New York Times is owned by NYT, Incorporated, which is owned by Altheon Ballistic Dynamics, which is owned by the Murdoch family, who are owned by Halliburton.
 It goes all the way to the top.
 How can you work here? Do you know who owns this place? Halliburton, bitch.
 So what? But look at you! You're meticulously groomed, and you turned a tie into a belt! Oh, so, gay men can't be conservative? You're so 'norant.
 That's short for "ignorant".
 And who are you to judge? You're still wearing those jeans.
 Che Guevara.
 If only you knew what this place stood for His great-grandfather was Domingo Halliburton! Wow.
 Haven't seen so many suits since my trial.
 I have an idea.
 I know these people, so let me do the talking.
 Oh, Steve, of course you know Ed Perlman.
 Perlman.
 Is that last name Jewish? New strategy.
 I'll raise the money, you stay in here and cultivate an aura of mystery.
 Oh, good idea.
 Maybe I'll add to it by making some mysterious sounds.
 I love it.
 I'll go to jail in DeShawn's place, 'cause he's my brother.
 Don't say nothin'.
 Sometimes you gotta do the right thing, even when the wrong thing is a whole lot easier.
 Now let's just have one last happy dinner together as a family.
 Your mother exploded.
 I got them right where I want them.
 Time to do a little Golden Globe shopping.
 No.
 Tracy, that movie gave me drunk-in-the-bathtub face.
 We need to talk.
 Thank you for coming.
 Well, you were right about Brooklyn Without Limits.
 Crunchy on the outside, right-wing nutjob on the inside.
 Like when Ann Coulter's underwear.
 But I see you're still wearing the jeans.
 I know! They look so good! And I'm Skyping later with Carol.
 And we like to dance together, and I want to do this "back it up" move that I haven't been able to pull off since high school! It's like back it up! Back it up! And drop it like it's hot! Drop it like it's hot! I will haunt your dreams! So fine, I'm selling out, but so are you! No.
 I believe in Steve Austin and his plan to put a casino on the moon.
 Then I believe in Halliburton.
 Good.
 So neither of us should feel guilty.
 We don't.
 Sabotage? But I'm the one who does that to me! I know, Tracy.
 It was wrong.
 But I couldn't go through with it.
 Because I saw your movie, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but you're great.
 Wait.
 "Great" like "good", or "grate" like the thing I dropped my asthma inhaler down the other day? The first one, Tray.
 You are going to win.
 And when you do, I'll be furious.
 Like "waking up next to Rob Schneider" furious.
 But I don't care.
 It's like you said in the movie, "Sometimes you gotta do the right thing, even when the wrong thing would be a whole lot easier.
" No, don't say that! In real life you have to make compromises! No, Liz Lemon.
 It's like the thing I said in another movie I made "Compromises are for lesser souls.
 Die, werewolf-zombie.
" So you two have decided to do the right thing? Fine! I'll go home and change! Take a last look, guys! I would hit that.
 Too small.
 I believe we are all being held in slavery by big government! Lesbian Mario Brothers! I couldn't do it, Jack.
 I just couldn't support BWL.
 But I'd already thrown out all my other jeans.
 That is the most unflattering item of clothing I have ever seen you wear.
 And I'm including 2008's Turtleneck with Smiley-Face Vest.
 But I feel good, and just because in my shorteralls I found a bag of TasteTations, a discontinued chocolate hard candy, but because sometimes you gotta do the right thing, even when the wrong thing would be a whole lot easier.
 Die, werewolf-zombie.
 God, Lemon.
 I will never allow casinos on the moon! Thank you! Steve? Friend or foe? You were the reason that everyone came here tonight.
 They need to hear you speak in person, from the heart.
 Damn you, shorteralls.
 Americans are a simple but powerful but people, which is why I have written a new national anthem Ooga-booga big Ooga-booga strong I am going to sing my ooga-booga song Ooga-booga big Ooga-booga strong Wow.
 That's worse than the speech my grandpa made when my cousin married a Japanese girl.
 As if that weren't enough, Austin was mocked in Jay Leno's monologue tonight.
 The kingmaker has spoken.
 It's over.
 Bookman will be re-elected.
 But you did the right thing.
 And, at the end of the day, isn't that more important than some merger? Letting morality get in the way of making money? I might as well go and be a teacher.
 I know what will cheer you up.
 Would you like some cake? Yeah.
 Cake Boy! This has been the best day of my life! I believe Ketchup bottles should be 500% larger.
 We are all responsible for heroes becoming terrible.
 But what kind of jail are these alien prisoners are being held in? We should bring back slavery! And they are backed by big corporations! Animals can govern themselves.
 Taken out of context it was exactly what I meant.
 As God is my witness, we will build casinos on the moon! Thank you! [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Where are Tracy and Jenna? We're supposed to be rehearsing! Hey, LL.
 Sorry we haven't had time to get into our costumes yet.
 How are we already behind today? Liz, women wearing men's watches is so over.
 The new thing is to get an Adam's apple.
 My mom just had this fixed for me.
 It was my grandfather's.
 He worked for years at Union Station in D.
C.
 As a pickpocket.
 Hey, hey, hey! Card game, guys! 20 bucks per! Pot's 1,040! Who's in? What is this, Jabba's pleasure skiff? It's the crew lottery, Liz! You buy a card.
 If it's picked you, win a thousand bucks! Get a tub of new suits from the Suit Emporium.
 KableTown guys notice.
 Your hair grows back.
 Everything grows back! All right.
 Anybody else? Fine, I'll take one if it'll get everyone back to work sooner.
 What are you doing? That game is not for Softhands and Faceworkers.
 It's for Strongs and Lifters.
 They hate when one of us wins.
 Your boos are not scaring me! I know most of you are not ghosts! Come on.
 My card only has a 1 in 52 chance of getting picked anyway.
 How did you know that? You're like Rain Man! Quick, how many toothpicks are on the ground? Zero.
 You need to go to Vegas! Oh, why is Toofer in the Punishment Corner? I said, "Time to end the charade and adjust my schedule to buy a new vase.
" You stay there! You stay there until you die! Look up the pronunciation for "schedule" on the Internet.
 Schedule.
 Ha! Stay in the corner! Wait, the computer.
 It's Jack's voice! America.
 Whiskey! Liberal.
 No, that can't be Jack.
 Why would his voice be on some random website? It's impossible.
 Lemon.
 Lesbian.
 Frankenstein.
 Wants.
 Her.
 Shoes.
 Back.
 Oh, my God, it is him.
 Come in, Lemon.
 Just revisiting some old GE quarterly reports.
 My first cover from my first year at the company in 1985.
 Good times.
 Just out of frame is a wheelbarrow full of cocaine.
 So why the trip down memory lame? High-fiving a million angels! The Microwave Division quarterly report comes out today.
 It'll probably be my last with GE, now that I'm transitioning to KableTown.
 I've been a GE man for 25 years.
 And a GE woman for one week of corporate espionage at Revlon.
 So is there any way you could possibly be the voice of pronouncify.
 Com? What? No! Those.
 Bastards.
 Those bastards! Who bastards? Part of my Princeton scholarship included work for the Linguistics Department.
 They wanted me to record every word in the dictionary to preserve the "Perfect American Accent" in case of nuclear war.
 Well, the Cold War ended and Princeton began selling the recordings.
 So people can just buy your voice? The things it's been dragged into.
 "Thomas the Tank Engine".
 Wu-Tang songs.
 ? Uh.
 Yeah.
 ? ? Just.
 Like.
 That.
 ? ? Make.
 'Em.
 Clap.
 ? ? Make.
 'Em.
 Make.
 'Em.
 Clap.
 ? Huh.
 I always forget you used to be poor.
 Thank you.
 But yes, I've had to work my entire life.
 It began when my father left and started working on the Boston docks as a 12-year-old stevedore.
 Bales up, you micks! Bales up.
 You've been working since you were 12? I had to.
 Those jobs put me through college.
 But they also kept me from having the "college experience.
" I was up early every morning, working my way though the dictionary for the Linguistics Department or sweeping the floors at the Princeton monkey lab.
 It wasn't the feces that got to you, Lemon.
 It was the crudely scrawled notes of, "Help me.
" Yeah, well college wasn't that fun, Jack.
 I mean, sure, the first two weeks are nice Lemon, I really don't have time for a long The Fall of 1988.
 A young Liz Lemon enters the University of Maryland.
 Richard Marx haircut.
 Pilonidal cyst under control.
 It was a magical time, Jack.
 Don't worry about getting to your point.
 I'm going to live forever.
 The registrar accidentally gave me a handicapped room.
 It was huge.
 And for two weeks, it was Party Central.
 I was popular.
 People gave me nicknames.
 A blonde girl high-fived me.
 But then, like all good things, it ended before it even began.
 Lemon, that's actually my thoughtful window staring spot.
 Visitors stare over here.
 Okay.
 All right guys, the moment we've all been waiting for.
 We're picking a winner.
 Here we go.
 This is the lucky one.
 Paula's nickname for my penis.
 And the winning card is the Queen of Spades! All right.
 Who's got it? Oh, brother.
 Queen of Spades? Oh! Come on! Boo! Really? She sucks! Boo! Come on! Guys! Guys, I'm not gonna keep it! I'm gonna take this money and open a tab for all of you after work at Hurley's! Wait, for real? You know it Arriflex! Chris is this guy.
 Well, that is really cool of you.
 All right! Lemon can you make sense of this? Well, on some level, yeah.
 That's a 4, that's a 9.
 Something's wrong here, Lemon.
 According to these numbers, the Microwave Division had their best quarter in five years.
 So? So, they did it without me.
 No they didn't.
 I mean, you're still the head of that division.
 You hired everyone there.
 If they succeeded, it's because of you.
 Lemon, that is the smartest thing you've ever said.
 Really? What about three years ago when I said there should be more TV shows about cake? I'll drive out to R&amp;D in Stamford, congratulate my team, make sure everyone remembers who got them there.
 They'll probably give me a crystal plaque, and I in turn will reward one of them with a name remembrance.
 Lemon, why does your crew look drunk? I won 1,000 dollars and gave them a bar tab and they got drunk at lunch and now they like me.
 Oh, Lemon, please.
 Money can't buy happiness.
 It is happiness.
 I.
 Love.
 Unicorns.
 I told them not to! Let's get out of here, Jack.
 I'll tell you what? Make me say anything you want.
 Get it out of your system.
 Obama.
 Is.
 Very.
 Presidential.
 Alright, enough! I was trying to be a good sport, but you should be ashamed of yourselves.
 A bunch of 30-year-olds sitting around acting like college freshmen Hey! I'm almost 46.
 when some of us had to spend their freshman year making those recordings.
 And leading a disastrous monkey escape.
 Grow up.
 You children.
 That.
 Went.
 Well.
 I never did this before! Say hey, Willie Mays! You know, usually everyone around here makes me feel like Hitler.
 But today, I feel like Hitler in Germany! Aw Being popular must be such a new experience for you.
 Well, it's not entirely new.
 Wow.
 I would experiment with that girl.
 Too small.
 That's me for two weeks in college.
 I was popular for one glorious fortnight and then it went away.
 I don't know what I did wrong.
 You probably said "fortnight.
" No, you didn't do anything, Liz.
 You were just you.
 The cool people figured that out and treated you accordingly.
 Well, ever since I gave the crew that lottery money, it's felt like those two weeks again.
 And you know what? I'm not blowing it this time.
 Hang on.
 You know this charade can't last.
 Just like in college, everyone has their role here.
 I'm the hot blonde.
 And I'm the nerd who takes off his glasses and everyone realizes he's handsome.
 And you're the R.
A.
 Only if "R.
A.
" stands for "really awesome.
" You are who you are! Hello? Hello, Pete.
 This is Jack.
 Jack? Hi! Oh, okay, look.
 What happened was Suzanne from Ad Sales got pushed into me in the elevator.
 I didn't try to touch her.
 And the sort of "uh" sound I made was about something else.
 Pete.
 Will you be my friend? Friend? Sure, of course.
 You know, whenever I tell my wife a work story she pointed this out the other day I always smile a little when I'm talking about you.
 I wish I was more of a free spirit like you.
 Now, freestyle rap for me.
 ? Rolling with my homie ? ? Me and Jackie D.
 ? ? Bitches get ready for a sex party ? Hey Liz, think fast! Okay, this is why we don't play football in the studio, guys! 'Cause it's too much fun! No, no! Nobody high-five her.
 What? But it's me, the Lizard.
 You can start calling me that.
 Look, we appreciate what you did for the crew last night, but you left some people out and that's not cool.
 What are you talking about? The Blizzard wouldn't do that! That's another option! Yeah, the alcoholics, Liz.
 How were they supposed to enjoy your bar tab? I didn't forget them, Chris.
 Their thing just hasn't gotten here yet.
 Really? Yeah.
 It's a surprise.
 And who knows what it gonna be? Only the Blizz-bian knows! All right! How long do you think this can go on? I've got it under control.
 This is why I hated my first two weeks at the Royal Tampa Academy of Dramatic Tricks.
 No one knew who was the sluttiest.
 But I showed them.
 Oh, I showed them all! And when we graduated a week later Whatever, Jenna.
 People's perceptions can change.
 Can they? Look at me.
 I'm Ogbert the nerd.
 Always have been, always will be.
 Look, there is no cool Liz.
 There is only R.
A.
 Liz.
 You're wrong.
 My glasses are dirty.
 Ogbert? Ah, the microwave lab.
 Boys, I received our quarterly report yesterday, and Hang on.
 Ajay, Raj, Ramesh? What's going on here? Where are Dinesh, Kumar, and Sunavo? Sir, this lab requires clearance Clearance? I'm your boss.
 I'm Jack Donaghy.
 I'm sorry.
 Your names all sound the same to us, John Donovan.
 I've worked here since 1985! I spearheaded the Trivection oven! Trivection? What is this, 2009? The future is the TK-421.
 A new model? How many vections does it have? Five.
 It's the perfect microwave.
 It even has a new voice feature.
 Popcorn.
 Setting.
 Medium.
 My God.
 Which one? Gentlemen, I am still the head of this division.
 And no microwave ships without my say-so.
 And I guarantee you that without my 25 years of experience, you did not build a "perfect" microwave.
 Now, I'm going to find out what's wrong with this machine, and when I do, you're going to wish you'd never been born.
 Which time? What are you tinkering with, sir? You know, my uncle was a tinkerer.
 Until the FBI shot him.
 Every GE product has to be no more than six Sigmas from perfection.
 Duh.
 So I'm taking this apart piece of junk until I prove that it should never be released.
 For the good of the company.
 Ready.
 Ready.
 Is this about the company, sir, or is it about you? I'm sorry, Kenneth, what? Sometimes a place can be so special to you that it feels like it couldn't possibly continue after you're gone.
 But after I left Kentucky Mountain Bible College, it still kept going.
 Until it was shut down.
 Because of the wolves.
 Maybe this is really about you not being able to let go.
 Tell me, Kenneth, what did you major in at that college? Television Studies with a minor in Bible Sexuality.
 So, not Psychiatry? Thank you, but if you really want to help me, stick your hand in there and see if you get a shock.
 Ah! My hand! Damn it.
 It's supposed to do that.
 Everyone enjoying the ice cream? Oh, yeah! Yeah! I don't even care that we've taken a 73 minute break to eat it! Oh, hey! Someone brought a dog to work! And it definitely doesn't have any of its own waste on its feet! Hey, why is Tony sulking? I couldn't go to the bar and now I can't have any ice cream.
 I totally forgot, broseph.
 You're a lactose intolerant alcoholic.
 I try to forget, too, but Liz made me remember in front of everybody.
 Poor Tony.
 Not cool, Liz.
 How "not cool" is this? I remembered how special Tony is and that's why I got him this watch! You think of everything! Lizard! Lizard! Lizard! Lizard! Lizard! Lizard! Lizard! Lizard! Lizard! Lizard! Lizard! Lizard! Lizard! Pete.
 Can.
 I.
 Tell.
 You.
 A.
 Secret? Of course.
 I told you about my blankie.
 I'm lonely.
 Would.
 You.
 Like.
 To.
 Come.
 To.
 My.
 Office.
 Tomorrow.
 Evening.
 And.
 Hang.
 Out? Bring.
 Your.
 Guitar.
 And.
 Some.
 Beer.
 In.
 Cans.
 And.
 We.
 Will.
 Jam.
 Okay, yeah, great.
 And, about that Kable Town stuff maybe we could talk about some new opportunities for me? Yes.
 I.
 Will.
 Make.
 Your.
 Dreams.
 Come.
 True.
 Make.
 Sure.
 You.
 Wear.
 One.
 Of.
 Those.
 Mexican.
 Ponchos.
 Okay! Yes! Nice! Yeah! All right, Kenneth, simulate a rainstorm.
 Sir, I was wrong about the hypothermia.
 I don't even feel cold anymore.
 I don't feel anything.
 Quiet! Look! The display is malfunctioning! Defrost.
 Power.
 Time.
 Left: Piz z a.
 Oh, really? That's how much time is left? "Pizza"? Mr.
 Donaghy, I don't know what point you think you're proving.
 Who would microwave something in a freezing rainstorm? Why don't you ask Choctee, an Inuit who wants a hot bowl of naglak, a man and food I just made up to illustrate a point? Sir, you have to let go.
 At least that's what my Nana is telling me from that tunnel of light behind you.
 Kenneth, I've told you this before.
 Your Nana is an idiot.
 Liz, we're pranking Pete and it's going too far! Please stop us! Why would I? I love pranks! I'm not the R.
A.
! No! But someone has to be that person! Hey.
 Everyone stop.
 Listen to Lutz.
 Hello, gentlemen.
 Remember me? Yes, I had the Greek salad.
 You know I'm not a delivery man! I'm wearing a suit and carrying a microwave! A so-called "perfect" microwave.
 Start.
 Time.
 19: 85.
 1985? That's not a time.
 I guess it could be a year The year I started working here, actually.
 That's interesting.
 19: 85.
 Yes.
 1985.
 Thank you.
 And since 1985, I have never allowed a subpar product Stop.
 The point is, my legacy here is Over.
 Done.
 Over.
 End.
 Stop.
 That's my voice.
 You all sound the same to us, Jock Dungaree.
 That was me.
 A young man who dreamed of running this company, who made a lot of sacrifices in pursuit of that dream.
 Good-bye.
 Potato.
 Good-bye.
 But he's right.
 It's over.
 Congratulations on making the finest microwave I've ever seen.
 Who ordered the Greek salad? Are we racist, or do those guys look a lot alike? You ready for this, J-Dog? Jam out? Drink some brews? Talk about everything and nothing? After today, that is exactly what I'm ready for.
 Beer me.
 Sitting around, drinking beer while a guy in a poncho plays guitar This is what I always pictured college being like.
 I wouldn't really know.
 I only had about two weeks of real college before Paula got pregnant.
 Twice.
 She had overlapping pregnancies five months apart.
 Hey, Pete do you know Aqualung? ? Sitting on a park bench ? ? I don't know the words except park bench ? Jimmy Slice! K-Bones! Mikey-Mike! Do not even use my awesome nickname.
 What? Why? Crisco.
 Did you give Tony your grandfather's watch? No! You can't prove that.
 "Not stolen property of Adolf Lemon.
 " Why would you do that? To get us to like you? Are you that desperate? No! I'm not desperate.
 I'm Just tell me what you want me to say and I'll say it! Liz, it's over.
 They know what you really are.
 Fine.
 You found me out.
 I'm not a cool kid.
 You suck! You know who I am? I'm the R.
A.
 And do you know what the R.
A.
's purview is? Rules.
 And guess what? According to the NBC Employee Handbook, your little card game lottery constitutes gambling.
 So you're not doing it anymore! What? Also, the next time I see someone throwing a football in here, there will be fines! And if I see that filthy dog again, I will put it down.
 I will put it down with a smile! Back to work, everyone! I love you, too.
 High-fiving a million angels! Hey, Pete, how do I know that the colors you see are the same as the colors that I see? Maybe what I see as red you perceive as green.
 We should be writing this stuff down.
 Oh.
 I didn't think anybody would be in here.
 I mean, I brought you guys a pizza.
 Lemon, think fast! What's going on here? Join us.
 Pete and I are having a little college night.
 Oh, yeah? Wanna see me shotgun this? Oh, God, she means the pizza! Oh! She's unhinging her jaw! C'mon, we were just pranking Pete! How long do we have to do this? You wanted college to go on forever? You got it! [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Hey, what was that sound? It was opportunity knocking.
 No one knocked.
 You just barged in.
 Knock, knock! You were right, Donald.
 It makes more sense for you to enter first.
 It's okay, Daddy.
 We'll just start over.
 You know, why don't we just dive in to whatever this is? Okay.
 You remember Donald, my son who's two years older than me.
 Ah, yes.
 Please.
 As I recall, you own the Tracy Jordan Institute for Black Karate.
 You wouldn't believe this, but that business failed.
 I blame Obama.
 But the good news is Donald has a brand-new venture.
 Sell him, son! It's a theme restaurant in Times Square! Well, the theme-restaurant business model does work.
 NASCAR's Fat Load CafÃ© is a gold mine.
 Well, we got a bunch of capital from Brown and Folderson, and we wanted to get you a seat on this rocket before it takes off.
 So it's decided.
 Jack's on board as an investor.
 Not so fast.
 So it's deci Let's just bottom-line this thing.
 I never invest without doing my research.
 I'll do a site visit tonight and kick the tires.
 All right, but if some other investor comes along, it's your loss.
 A Mexican billionaire is calling me right now.
 Excuse me.
 SeÃ±or Mexico, hola.
 SÃ­, sÃ­.
 Yo soy Donald, sÃ­.
 Â¿ Ãndale, Ã¡ndale? Â¿ Arriba, arriba? What is SeÃ±or Mexico saying? Stop keeping me out of the loop! Hey, Jenna, I need to go over What is it, Liz? We're busy.
 Jenna and I are mirroring until we achieve touchless orgasm.
 And finished.
 Well, I have to go to work.
 My new manager is making us wear name tags.
 I might as well be working at a roller-skating drag-queen restaurant under Taliban rule! But after your shift, we still have our special night, right? You have no idea how special.
 We're celebrating our six-month anniversary, and I think Paul's gonna pop the question! Really? That's a little fast, isn't it? And I will say yes when Paul proposes that we make a sex tape and leak it on the Internet.
 Oh.
 I thought you meant marriage.
 God, no! Marriage is like death.
 You settle into a routine, you lose all the spark.
 I don't know.
 I always thought the whole point of being with someone for a long time is to get to the comfortable-routine part.
 No, relationships are like sharks, Liz.
 If you're not left with several bite marks after intercourse, then something's wrong.
 Well, nothing's wrong with me and Carol.
 I mean, we haven't spoken in five days, but that doesn't mean anything.
 Because we are not sharks.
 We are legless turtles rotting on the beach.
 Jack, what makes a guy get bored in a dating situation? That's an excellent question.
 The answer is questions like that.
 Look, this long distance is hard.
 And now Carol and I haven't talked in like five days.
 And my other stuff is still unresolved.
 I get it, Lemon.
 You need to see a therapist, someone you can dump your problems on, and then get on with your, uh "life.
" I'm trying.
 I just can't find someone I like.
 I mean, have you ever been to a shrink? No.
 I believe that, when you have a problem, you talk it over with your priest or your tailor or the mute elevator porter at your men's club.
 Then you take that problem and crush it with your mind vise.
 But for lesser beings, like curly-haired men and people who need glasses, therapy can help.
 And, Lemon, I want you to get better.
 Because, and I mean this, I'm tired of talking this much to a woman I'm not having sex with.
 Hey, Jack! Welcome to Staples! Why did you choose that name? Because "staples" means "the basics.
" And that's what you're getting here.
 Food, drinks, fun.
 Staples.
 Yeah, we got that.
 Staples is also a giant office-supply chain.
 Well, we'll see who's still in business 200 years from now.
 Donald, I'm going to pick a problem at random.
 Is the theme of your restaurant Not Enough Tables? No, we just need a lot of room for the monster fight.
 Excuse me? Jack, are you familiar with the mega-restaurant Medieval Times? Well, I took that model and replaced the knights with unlicensed versions of Japanese monsters.
 Ladies and gentlemen, there's been a underwater nuclear explosion! A beast has been awakened! It approacheth with fearsome steps! Boom! Boom! Boom! Are we paying the price for our hubris of science? Witness the primeval might that is Godzila, with one "L" for trademark reasons! Oh! No one is safe! Who all's going to protect us? It's Mechagodzila! Boom! Boom! Boom! Thank you for choosing Staples! Donald, George punched my crotch! You liked it! Oh, my God.
 Captain Burnett called earlier, Miss Lemon.
 Finally! Not that it matters.
 We're turtles.
 He says he doesn't have cell-phone service 'cause he's on layover in Daytona Beach.
 But don't worry, he's fine and having a great time with his flight crew, Stewart, Brenda, Amber, Crystal.
 Also, in the background, I heard lady giggles and the sound of a beautiful sunset.
 See? This is why I need to find someone to talk to.
 Talk to about what? Men.
 Trust.
 I mean, I just feel like sometimes men aren't totally honest with me.
 Go on.
 Well, for starters, everyone I ever dated in high school turned out to be either gay or a girl dressed as a guy to get a journalism scholarship.
 My own dad tried to secretly cheat on my mom, and I thought their marriage was perfect.
 And, of course, there's Santa Claus.
 Okay.
 Talk about that.
 When I was seven, I asked for a CB radio for Christmas so I could track gas prices around the state for a cool chart I was making.
 We'll get back to that later.
 When I didn't get it, my dad blamed Santa Claus.
 Well, Santa made an enemy that day.
 And the next year, when he returned to the Schuylkill Galleria, so did vengeance.
 Ho! Ho! Ho! What can Santa bring you this year? What does it matter? You didn't bring me what I asked for last year, you fat fraud! You're a bigger disappointment than our current president, Jimmy Carter! I am a fraud, little boy! My wife still thinks I work at the bank! I guess Santa Claus was the first man to ever betray me.
 That must have been difficult.
 It was.
 But it feels good to talk about it.
 Thanks.
 Miss Lemon, there's a reason God gave us two ears and only one mouth.
 Listening is twice as important as talking.
 But He gave us ten fingers.
 He must really want us to poke things! Poke, poke, poke! It's the vacant lot where we had our first face kiss! Who stole my canteen? Jenna, what we have is so beautiful.
 People need to see how happy we make each other.
 And I think we're ready to take that step.
 So over Christmas, I want you to come to Ohio and meet my parents.
 What? Happy anniversary.
 Hey, get a room whatever that is! Well, Tracy, I went to the restaurant last night.
 That place is a disaster.
 Damn it, you think I don't know that? I've poured more cash into Donald's restaurant than my money pit in Connecticut! You have a house in Connecticut? No, I do not! Jack, I need other investors besides me.
 What? You're the only one bankrolling this? What about Brown and Folderson? That's what I call my wallet! I've bankrolled every one of Donald's dumb ideas.
 But what choice do I have? I'm his father.
 But you're doing him no favors, as a business partner or a father.
 You need to cut him off.
 Come on.
 The boy's only 43 years old.
 Tracy, listen to me.
 Not everyone is cut out to be a businessman.
 For example, curly-haired men and people who need glasses.
 But I can't crush his dreams.
 You're not.
 You're just letting him fly with his own wings.
 And I bankrolled that, too! Thank God we tested it with a monkey first! Miss Lemon, I'm signing people up for the 'TGS' softball team.
 So far, I have 8 "nos" and 25 "shove it up your goon-holes.
" Shove it up your goon-hole.
 You know, ever since we had our little talk yesterday, I've been doing some thinking.
 Good.
 If I remember correctly, we were discussing men and trust.
 Yeah, and it got me thinking about my Aunt Linda.
 What was she like? Great, until she got divorced.
 My Uncle Harry was cheating on her.
 Another male betrayal.
 Go with that.
 My parents used to make me go to Linda's house just so she'd have company.
 I hated those visits.
 Your uncle never liked my cooking.
 But you do, right, Elizabeth? You love your Aunt Linda! Here's a fun game! Put on Harry's cologne and give me a back rub in the bath! To this day, whenever I hear someone's getting divorced, I can still taste that egg, and I Oh, my God.
 My trust issues and my food issues are connected! Uncle Harold is the reason eggs make me gag! Kenneth, you're the perfect therapist.
 I can dump all of my problems on you, walk away, and move on with my life! It's a win-win! Why did she have to say "Harold"? Liz last night was a disaster, and not the good kind where I get to sing at a benefit.
 What happened? Paul's idea of moving things forward is me meeting his parents! He said they live in a "soo-borb"? Suburb.
 Come on, Jenna.
 It's not what you wanted, but it's progress.
 In the wrong direction! I think I know what's really going on between you and Paul.
 You're in love, and it's terrifying to you.
 You're trying to sabotage it.
 Sabotage? I'm the one trying to make this relationship work, which is why I'm gonna have to be the one to propose the sex tape.
 Call me old-fashioned, but I think that's the man's job.
 Jack! I found a therapist, and I've made some big breakthroughs.
 I know you don't know what this means, but I'm eating eggs again! I know it means this conversation is disgusting.
 Okay, Donald is on his way up.
 I know cutting him off is hard, but it's your duty as a parent Tracy, do not laugh at the word "duty.
" Be strong.
 Be rational.
 No emotion.
 Unemotional.
 Got it.
 Daddy, what's going on? I just love you so much! I love you, too, Daddy! Okay, stop it.
 Donald, what Tracy is trying to tell you is that you're an adult and he will no longer support you financially.
 Is that true, Daddy? For the love of God, stop calling him "Daddy.
" It is true, little man.
 But I need you to be a big boy on this.
 You're just not meant to be a businessman.
 Fine.
 I'll be okay.
 I've got other ideas, like a microbrewery that also serves frozen yogurt.
 I'm gonna call it Microsoft.
 I have this recurring dream Actually, is it recurring if you wake yourself up with a and then return to it? Anyway, in the dream, I'm a baby, and my parents left me on top of the car by accident, and we're being chased I think has to do with my issues with sex.
 Lemon, what are you doing? Is Kenneth your therapist? Well, kind of.
 He can't handle that! Look at his head shape.
 He has no brain pan! It's fine, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I'm okay.
 And so am I! I'm Cheryl.
 This is exactly why I told you to see a professional.
 You dump your problems on some half-baked Barney Fife, and you can start a chain reaction of mental anguish.
 Look what you've done to him! But he's such a good listener, and he takes my insurance! I'm going to help you.
 Lie down.
 Put your mental burden in my mind vise, and I will crush it.
 Kenneth, who is Harold? He was a role model of mine growing up.
 Please let Harold be human.
 Harold was a pig.
 You see, my father passed when I was just a young boy.
 After that, I was alone a lot and awful sad.
 But that pig saved me.
 In some ways, Harold was the only thing I had that was like a father.
 You had a void to fill.
 Continue.
 Then one day, my mama told me we had to sell him.
 I knew what that meant.
 Harold was off to the slaughterhouse.
 I know it's difficult I'm not done, sir.
 It gets worse.
 With Harold gone, there was nothing keeping me at home.
 It was time for me to move to New York and follow my dreams.
 But I needed $300 for the river ferry-train-oxcart-train-bus ticket.
 And that's when I saw the sign.
 I knew I could win that contest.
 Why, I once ate an entire witch.
 A pig was nothing! And then they brought me mine.
 I would have recognized those eyes anywhere.
 Kenneth, no.
 It was Harold, and I ate all of him even the face, in case of a tie.
 Good God.
 I ate him, sir! I ate my father-pig! Okay.
 Or you gave his death meaning.
 His sacrifice made you what you are today, which is the lowest-level employee at the last-place network in America.
 I guess that is true.
 Thank you, sir, I'll think on that.
 And you're sure you're okay hearing about all my problems? Of course.
 I'm Jack Donaghy.
 Oh, no! Crush it! Oh, God, here comes my childhood! I'm in here, Paul.
 The restaurant was crazy today.
 During Nude Hour, I got custard all over my penis.
 What's going on in here? You want to take this to the next level? Let's videotape our lovemaking, pretend the tape got stolen, and let the whole world see.
 Wow.
 I don't know, Jenna.
 I'm pretty beat.
 I see.
 Fine.
 I guess we're just done having any adventure or excitement in our lives.
 Well, jeez, I'm sorry that I'm happy with the way things are.
 I mean, come on, why can't we just paint each other's toenails, watch vintage pornography, and then go to bed in our swing like a normal couple? Because it's boring.
 We might as well be married! Okay, this isn't about us being adventurous.
 This is about you being afraid to settle down with me.
 That's not true! Fine, let's do this tape, but then what? What will you want next? Well, there's a sex resort in Japan where white people are treated like slaves.
 No, Jenna.
 You're making it impossible to live up to your expectations.
 What are you saying? I'm saying adopting a dog so it can watch us make love and then returning it, claiming that it bit our imaginary child, is everything that I need.
 But if that's really not enough for you, tell me now.
 I'm sorry.
 Very well.
 I'm not gonna beg you.
 I have my dignity.
 I'll trust you to fairly divide up our panties.
 I'll come get them tomorrow while you're at work.
 Miss Lemon, I have another message from Captain Burnett.
 Please don't get sad and remember things and infect me again! Kenneth, it's okay.
 I'm not worried about Carol anymore.
 I'm just sorry I messed you up like that.
 Don't worry.
 I had my brain cleaned by Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I told him everything! How Harold No, no, don't tell me your story! I can't handle it.
 Look how small my head is.
 Oh, my! It's so tiny! Daddy, I wanted to give you your share of our profits before I shut down my dream.
 Someone left it in coat check.
 Tracy, listen to me! I was wrong.
 Don't turn your back on Donald.
 Too late.
 Look how we're positioned.
 Kenneth told me a story earlier, a story about fathers and sons, and despite my best effort, it unearthed a memory from my own childhood.
 As a boy, I wanted to be an astronaut or a deep-sea diver, a man of science.
 But I was raised by Jimmy Donaghy, a man who projected his own failed dreams onto his family.
 When I was in third grade, my class put on a science play.
 The night before, Jimmy came home drunk and found me rehearsing my lines.
 I was struggling with the science terms, and Jimmy laughed and said, "Well, looky here.
 Doctor Jack, the boy who wants to be a scientist.
 Chowderhead can't even say the words.
 You'll never be nothin'!" The next day, I was up on that stage I looked out at the audience, I saw Jimmy, and I froze.
 I am a protoin! Protein! All living orgasms I mean orgasms! Chowderhead can't even say the words! When I got home, I threw away my microscope, my shell collection, my map of the stars.
 Nerd! A parent is the one person who is supposed to make their kid think they can do anything, says they're beautiful even when they're ugly, thinks they're smart even when they go to Arizona State.
 Let the rest of the world tear your kid down.
 Your job is to support him no matter what.
 Tracy believes in you, Donald.
 Go and make him proud.
 That's a nice long speech and all, but your daddy was right.
 You couldn't be a scientist.
 You couldn't even be protein in a school play.
 And I can't run a business.
 I'm a failure.
 I am a protein! All living organisms need me to function! A basic building block of the human body, I am made from amino acids found in ribosomes.
 Proteins give energy to everything from flowers and butterflies to heroes who turn in Communists.
 I am a protein! Daddy, can I have $50,000 to start a business where people can call in and get air-quality reports from all across the United States? I'm gonna call it Donald, no.
 American Airlines! And it's going to work, son! This is what happens when you work at being happy! Godzilla sits next to you while you're eating an egg-salad sandwich.
 What a world! What's the point? I moved here to make it on Broadway.
 Now look at me.
 I'm pathetic! I've got no real skills, a degree in Theater Tech, so you move back to Pennsylvania, live with your parents.
 All of your old friends have kids and careers, and what do you have? Maybe your name on a TV show that no one will even remember.
 I should have moved to Cleveland with that guy when I had the chance.
 Damn you, Gojira! [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			- Merry Christmas Eve Eve, Jack.
 Likewise, Lemon.
 Is there any chance you'll still be around tomorrow? Sure.
 Do you want to go to the Penn Station K-Mart with me and then watch "Tootsie"? I'm sorry, that's what you're doing instead of spending Christmas Eve with your family? It's my new thing, travel on Christmas Day.
 That way I avoid the annual Lemon family blow-up.
 And this year, it's gonna be a doozy.
 My Aunt Linda is bringing her new boyfriend, who is neither her age nor her race, and her ex-husband will also be there with his date, alcoholism.
 I swoop in the next day for presents and pie.
 Well, if you're around, come by for dinner.
 Colleen will be up from Florida and she'd love to see you.
 Because my youthful energy makes her feel young? No, because she views you as a peer she can complain with about how no one wears pantyhose any longer.
 How are we supposed to conceal our spider veins? Bare legged Christmas! Okay, guys, this KableTown promo is the last thing we have to do before the holiday break.
 Liz Lemon, I cannot participate in this promo.
 Why? Because it's not honest.
 As an actor, it is my job to tell the truth, hold a mirror to humanity, and to sell Proactiv.
 I will not spout your lies, Liz Lemon! And I will not say, "Merry Christmas from KableTown.
" Ever since Tracy got nominated for a Golden Globe, he thinks he's Sean Penn.
 Well, they have both had screaming fights with Wyclef Jean.
 We'll just do this without him.
 Merry Christmas, Jenna.
 You can say both lines.
 "Merry Christmas from KableTown and all of us at 'TGS.
"' I think we got it.
 Hey, are you okay? "Tom Ford and Elton John invite you to New Queer's Eve.
" What is this? NQE is the New Year's party.
 Everyone dresses up as a cultural figure from the past year.
 Also, replicas of The David urinate vodka! Oh, God! Paul and I were going to come up with an amazing couple's costume.
 But now that he's gone, what's the point? This party means so much to me.
 I don't know what I'm going to do without it! The party or Paul? The party, Liz! Good news.
 We don't have to do these promos after all.
 NBC says they want them from every show but us.
 Good year, everyone! What Christmas card did we end up sending out? Oh, "Happy Holidays is what terrorists say.
 Merry Christmas, Avery and Jack.
" Oh, it's just Liz.
 Why do people always say that? Avery's keeping her pregnancy a secret at work, so she's been carrying around large objects whenever she's in the building.
 I was wondering what was up with your show last night.
 The market rallying today despite a pullback in gold stocks.
 Anyway, I was gonna bring dessert tomorrow.
 So, are any foods making you nauseous lately? Please don't say a half-sleeve of Oreos.
 Oh, I'm not gonna be there.
 I'm leaving tonight to spend Christmas with my family.
 Really? It's why I like dating older men.
 Their parents are usually dead or senile so there's never an argument about the holidays.
 Why aren't you and Colleen going with her? Oh, you know.
 Colleen is frail, and Avery is in her third trimester.
 You haven't told Colleen about the baby yet! What? I have been watching "The Mentalist" a lot lately because my TV is on CBS and I lost my remote.
 I think I've become a body language expert.
 For instance, I can now tell that Jack wants to kill the person to his right.
 Why haven't told her? I just haven't found the right time.
 That is no excuse! I can't believe you haven't told This is her granddaughter that we are talking I cannot have the two of you on the same side of an argument! We Donaghys believe that when there's something at all delicate to talk about, it is best to suppress it until it erupts into a fist fight at a church barbecue.
 I understand all that, Jack.
 The symbol on the Jessup family crest is a knight refusing to talk about his feelings.
 But this baby is not bad news.
 You don't know Colleen.
 We're not married, Avery Why should that matter? She did the same thing.
 I mean, what did Colleen say when you told her you knew about your real dad? You never told her about Milton, either! I am "The Mentaliz"! That was over a year ago! You have so many secrets! How do you not get hives? How could you not tell her? For the love of God! Sir, this came for you.
 Thanks, K-L-M-N-O-P.
 I've been waiting for this.
 Oh, I didn't know you made another "Chunks" movie, Mr.
 Jordan.
 That first one was a classic! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to celebrate the life of Athea Chunk.
 Damn! That's funky! Obesity is killing the African American community with laughter! Yeah, well this sequel is never coming out.
 I bought the rights so this movie won't be released.
 Why wouldn't you want people to see your movie? It looks so funny.
 That's the problem, Ken.
 It's 67 minutes of me acting like a hilarious fool.
 If this movie comes out before the Golden Globes, it'll ruin my new image.
 Mr.
 Jordan, I thought you loved acting like a fool.
 No, I don't.
 I'm lying! My favorite thing in the world is making people laugh, but I can't now! I have to go on "Charlie Rose", Kenneth! "Charlie Rose"! That's horrible! I have no choice.
 I gotta stay serious.
 From now on, the only movies Tracy Jordan makes are about the Holocaust, Georgia O'Keeffe, or both! I didn't care much for the gazpacho soup.
 I mean, where's the fun of sending it back because it isn't hot? Mother.
 Yes? Avery and I are having a baby.
 I see.
 May I remind you this is good news? This is a disgrace! What are my chums at the Death Shore Retirement Community going to say? When I tell them that my unmarried son has knocked up a Protestant? I knew you'd do this.
 Take a happy moment and ruin it.
 Just like you did when I won that scholarship at my high school graduation.
 It should have gone to the other boy! This is the reason I waited seven months to tell you You kept this from your own mother? Oh, oh, Colleen.
 Don't talk to me about secrets.
 I know some things you've done that you would not want me to bring up right now.
 Most people thought I was a hero for killing Lydia's parrot.
 I'm going upstairs now and think about more comments for tomorrow.
 This isn't over! Jack! Guess what? They just got Caller ID in Vermont! Milton, I hope you don't have plans for tomorrow.
 I'm having a little Christmas dinner and I want you to be my guest of honor.
 Well it is sudden, but yes, I'd love to come to your holiday dinner.
 Christmas! It's Christmas dinner! Hey, Rick, can you cover Section 3 for me? I'm in the weeds.
 Oh, Liz.
 I'm sorry, I thought you were a transvestite.
 Paul, I need to talk to you.
 About Jenna.
 How is she? Honestly, I don't think I've seen her this upset since Hurricane Katrina.
 The coverage pre-empted a tampon commercial she was in.
 And she keeps trying to pretend it's just about some New Year's party, but I think she misses you.
 I miss her, too.
 But it's over between us now.
 I don't even think about Jenna anymore.
 I don't think about kissing her, or laughing with her, or photographing her with just salamanders covering her nipples.
 When it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be.
 You can't be on the floor without your roller skates, Rick! I'm not Rick! Merry Christmas, Jack.
 Sorry, I finished the Oreos in the cab.
 I'm glad you could make it, Lemon.
 Welcome to my Christmas Attack Zone.
 Your what? What does that mean? Professor Milton Greene is on his way here from Penn Station.
 Milton, your father, is coming here? Please tell me that Colleen Has no idea.
 The father that she hid from me for 50 years, the that man she doesn't even know I know exists, is joining us for supper.
 Red or white? White! Jack, what are you doing? You promised me a drama-free dinner! I could be sitting at the corner table at the K-Mart Café right now! Oh, that must be dad.
 Wait, does Milton know that Colleen is here? No, I want it all to be fresh.
 Will he erupt with anger over her years of secrecy? Who knows.
 Milton's a hippie pacifist, but I once saw Colleen provoke a Buddhist monk into whipping a battery at her.
 My boy! Oh, Jack, this is going to be the best Winter's Eve Light Festival ever! Liz! And a happy Whatever-You-Believe-ln, too! No.
 I am not letting this happen.
 Milton, Jack has an ulterior motive for bringing you here.
 Yes.
 It's true.
 You're going to be a grandfather.
 Oh, what a blessing! Life is beautiful! "Joy, beautiful spark of the gods, daughter of Elysium.
" And Liz, you're already showing! No, it's not me! And that is not what he has to tell you.
 Colleen is here and Jack is using you to ambush her! Why would you do that? I'll tell you why.
 Because when my mother found out about your granddaughter It's a girl! She'll be intuitive! Colleen did not see it as a "blessing.
" She saw it as an embarrassment because my girlfriend Avery and I are not married.
 An embarrassment? She has no right to judge you.
 She needs to read my new book, "There's No Wrong Way to Make a Family".
 That's for you.
 I agree with you, Milton.
 But Colleen disapproves.
 Well, that's awfully hypocritical for a woman who kept her son a secret from his own father! I'm gonna give her a piece of my mind tonight.
 Oh, great, Avery's here.
 And she looks mad.
 Jack, I got your message.
 How dare Colleen disapprove of me? Of us? Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean for my message to make you angry and have you come all the way back here.
 Now there are three people here that are mad at Colleen! Wait, this is Avery? How could that woman not adore such a beautiful daughter-in-law? By the way, we have a tradition in my family where we let the child name itself.
 Oh, yeah.
 That's hippie nonsense.
 Absolutely not.
 Well, suit yourself, but my son Spider-Man turned out just fine.
 Okay, this is disgusting.
 It is Christmas.
 You are not going to ambush an old woman for the mistakes that she has made.
 I mean, who hasn't made mistakes? I once French-kissed a dog at a party to try to impress what turned out to be a very tall 12-year-old.
 Lemon, we all know what mistakes are! I'm going to go tell Colleen what's happening while you all calm down.
 Where is her room? Don't worry.
 I sent her to the East Wing.
 It's very confusing.
 It was designed by M.
C.
 Escher.
 These stairs are weird! Mother! Dinner is ready! What are you doing here, sir? I wasn't setting this up because I'm spending Christmas at work.
 I certainly wasn't going to pretend those trash cans were my parents.
 I here picking up a serious outfit from wardrobe for my event later.
 All the big actors do charity work on Christmas Eve.
 Russell Crowe is having an auction to benefit the victims of his own mood swings.
 So what are you doing, sir? Screening my very sad movie, "Hard to Watch", at a women's shelter.
 It's gonna be real depressing.
 I hate seeing you like this, sir.
 And you ruined Ludachristmas.
 In the Darfur region, the dead may be the lucky ones.
 Next slide.
 What else can I do, Kenneth? People only take you seriously if you're serious.
 But comedy is just as important as drama.
 People need to laugh, especially in these tough times.
 And after all, isn't laughter the best medicine? Except for insulin, spironolactone, and bupropion, which I have for you whenever you're ready, sir.
 Mother, you look lovely.
 I see you've brought the bag that my bastard grandchild will come in.
 Merry Christmas, Mrs.
 Donaghy.
 My gift to you is the feeling of superiority you'll have for the next two seconds.
 Is she drunk, Jack? Because you know when you're pregnant, one bottle of wine a day and that's it.
 Mother, you must remember Milton Greene.
 My father.
 And your shameful sex secret.
 Why would you bring him here? Oh, I see.
 You're trying to make me look like the bad guy, is that it? You are the bad guy! You kept me from my son for 50 years! You didn't miss much.
 He's a good boy.
 He got me a kidney! From Elvis Costello! All that time lost because of you and your pride.
 And think of what I've lost.
 Going on father and son Habitat for Humanity builds and road trips in my VW van! Yeah! Or other things! And then you dare to judge us and our life decisions? Who do you think you are? God, this house is enormous! Oh, hi, Colleen.
 I tried to stop this.
 Well, Mother, what do you have to say for yourself? It's speechless! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas one and all! Jenna, this dinner is a disaster.
 My life is ruined! I just came up with the perfect couple's costume for New Queer's Eve and I can't use it because of stupid Paul! You know what? The reason I'm not with my family right now is because I didn't want any drama! And that's all I'm getting.
 First from these jagwagons, and now you! Paul is the reason you're upset.
 It's not about this party It's about the party! I want to eat shrimp off an old gay dressed as Baby New Year! Hi, Colleen.
 Are you all right? Just thinking about my next move.
 No, no, what next move? This thing hasn't even started.
 Welcome to my Christmas Attack Zone.
 Ladies of the battered women's shelter, please be quiet.
 A man is talking.
 You are about to watch a film that holds a mirror up to your own terrible lives.
 You're gonna see poverty, drug abuse, and a bunch of babies having a hammer fight in a dumpster.
 Comedy is just as important-portant-portant Laughter is the best medicine-medicine-medicine Damn it! I can't get Kenneth out of my head.
 Actually, he's behind you, Tray.
 He rode over here with us.
 You talked to him the whole ride.
 Well, he's right! People do need to laugh.
 And I'm the medicine.
 What are you doing? Something I should have done a long time ago.
 "A long time ago"? You just got here.
 Shut up, Dotcom.
 Ladies and children, I give you "The Chunks 2: A Very Chunky Christmas"! Lights! Damn Christmas lights blew a fuse Well, this has turned out to be the opposite of what I wanted and I'm gonna leave before anything else happens.
 So Oh, my God.
 My arm! It's numb! What are you doing now, Mother? I think the stress Don't go to her! Do you have shortness of breath? Are you sweating? Do you have neck or jaw pain? I've had a couple rich men die on top of me.
 It's like something like my son sitting on my chest.
 We should call an ambulance.
 We are not calling anyone! What's the matter with you? Your mother is not well! Can't you see that she's faking, Milton! There! Did anybody see that? We have to call an ambulance.
 Listen to me, damn it, I'm a doctor! Of history! In what emergency would you be necessary? If someone wanted to know whether the '60s were awesome or not? They were! You hang in there.
 You need to meet our daughter.
 Little Colleen.
 Seems like people are back on my side, Jackie.
 Paul.
 My ex-lover.
 Listen, I'm not here because I want to get back together.
 Good.
 Me neither.
 Can I get you a cup of coffee or an absinthe enema? No, thank you, I can't stay.
 I just wanted to let you know that I had an amazing idea for a couple's costume Well, so did I.
 What's yours? Maybe we should just say them at the same time and see what happens? You dress as Natalie Portman I dress as Natalie Portman from the movie "Black Swan" from the movie "Black Swan" and I dress as and you dress as former Pittsburgh Steelers former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver wide receiver and Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania gubernatorial nominee gubernatorial nominee Lynn Swann! Lynn Swann! We're two black swans! We're two black swans! Well, it is a Druid Solstice miracle that it wasn't a heart attack.
 Yes, I do believe a heart is required.
 That is enough, Jack! What happened tonight was so scary.
 And the reason that it happened is that we were not being honest with each other.
 So from now on, no more secrets.
 Okay, I'll go first.
 I have a crush on the Mentalist Just family only, Lemon! Damn it! There is one more secret Jack and I have been keeping from all of you.
 We were planning to elope in the Caribbean over New Year's, but now we want you all to come.
 Oh, how wonderful! You know what I learned tonight? As hard as you try, no one can escape the horror of Christmas.
 So it might as well be with your own family.
 I'm going to go get a bus to White Haven now and I should be home just in time for Aunt Linda to try to prove that she's sober by holding someone's baby while cooking.
 Listen, Jackie.
 Everything I've ever done in life has been to protect you.
 I know.
 And if I got upset earlier, it's because I want your life to be perfect.
 Unlike mine.
 Don't let him off the hook, Colleen.
 What he did tonight was wrong and he owes you an apology.
 He's right.
 I almost died.
 And using your father like that is so disrespectful.
 He's a doctor, for God's sakes! Your mother and I are very disappointed in you, Jack! What are you smiling at, you fruitcake? Just my mom and dad yelling at me together.
 Milton, the Clinton boom years were just an after-effect of Reaganomics.
 And, Mother, you cannot invite anyone to the wedding.
 Fascist pig! What happened to the heart attack? Let me tell you about this talk about Reaganomics I gave you a home for so long.
 No, you insult your own intelligence.
 I'll invite anybody I want to this wedding! To this wedding or any other wedding! You sound like a typical capitalist pig! Merry Christmas.
 Long lay the world In sin and darkness pining 'Til He appeared And the soul felt his worth A thrill of hope The weary world rejoices For yonder brakes A new and glorious morn Fall on your knees Oh, hear the angel voices Oh, night devine Oh, night when Christ was born Oh, night devine Oh, night when Christ was born Oh, holy night The stars are brightly shining It is the night of the dear Savior's birth And hope everybody, everybody have a merry Christmas.
 And somebody needs to clean this table up.
 It's disgusting.
 Fred, wake up! Merry Christmas from the Chucks! [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Happy New Year.
 Congratulations on getting married, sir.
 I know I didn't deserve to be invited, so I thought I would give you your gift now.
 Not if it's a song.
 It's not.
 It's this belt.
 Well, the nuptials were perfect.
 We rented a villa on St.
 Esclavage.
 For my second wedding, I just wanted a five-minute ceremony surrounded by one giant party.
 So the service was performed by an exiled French Admiral/defrocked minister.
 Well, I'm glad it went smoothly.
 You and I The only hiccup was that my best man, deep-sea explorer and raconteur Bob Ballard, took ill after eating some bad toucan.
 So Lemon filled in as my best man This is from St.
 Esclavage.
 It's my marriage certificate.
 Oh, good God! Liz Lemon, I want it to be noted that I am here on time.
 This is a new year and a fresh start for me.
 Now I got to go.
 Where are you going? I'm hosting the International Pornography Awards, and I have to go get an insurance physical so I can fly into the arena in a penis-shaped parachute.
 Hey, what is going on with Jenna's dressing room? Jack rented it out to an IT company.
 The KableTown board is meeting this week to approve buying NBC, and he's doing everything possible to make us seem profitable.
 He turned the greenroom into an NBC Experience Store.
 And we have to schedule our rehearsals around the bat mitzvahs Jack has booked in the studio.
 When Madison was born, I said, "Rivka, my schveltz is filled with schpoinkis!" Okay, well, I'm gonna talk to Jack about this.
 I'm sure he's still in a good mood from the wedding.
 Oh, yeah, how was that? Total chaos.
 No rehearsal, no program, the bride wore a black cocktail dress.
 The airline lost my luggage, and the only place to buy anything on the island was at the tennis pro shop! Luckily, I had the essentials in my carry-on toiletries, closed-toe shoes, and the State Department- recommended mosquito head net.
 I sense more complaining in you.
 Terrible flower girl.
 At 4 years old, you should know how to pace your petal distribution.
 Hannah! Petal, step.
 Petal, step.
 Come on! And don't even get me started on the monkeys You! It needs to see Mr.
 Donaghy! It needs to see him right away! Get us all our stuff back! Hey.
 Elizabeth, shut the door.
 Lemon, during my wedding ceremony, do you remember being asked a question by the minister? Yeah.
 It was something like And in spite of not understanding, you responded, "Oui.
" Well, one of my New Year's resolutions is to say yes Yes to love, yes to life, yes to staying in more! Do you remember signing this document afterwards? Yeah.
 The minister told me to on the Épouse line.
 "Witness.
" Not "witness.
" No, Lemon.
 Wife.
 Mother Oui! They married us by mistake? It is a clerical error that will be rectified immediately.
 See? This is exactly the kind of thing that happens when there is no order, no planning! Hitler and Martha Stewart would have hated that wedding! Of course it's everyone else's fault that the minister thought the lady in the white dress and the veil was the bride! It was a men's tennis shirt and a government-sanctioned head net.
 You kept holding onto my arm! It's hard to balance on sand! Who wears shoes on a beach? Only Rocky and Apollo Creed during the training montage! Who cares? You're fixing it.
 I'm sorry you got caught up in another one of Liz Lemon's adventures.
 My adventures! I am the protagonist! Avery is in China right now covering an economic conference.
 She is not a spy.
 I want this taken care of before she gets back.
 Divorce papers are being drawn up.
 Try to sign on the right line.
 Whatever you say, dear.
 Do not.
 Do not.
 Don't forget, honey, we have bridge with the Cunninghams tonight.
 Tracy, you are going to die What? No! when I tell you who I'm dating.
 Squeaky Fromme.
 She is difficult.
 Anywho, I have the results of your physical.
 Tracy, you are going to die.
 What? No! You have no reflexes, your blood tastes like root beer, and some of your bones appear to have vanished.
 Now, I've only ever seen this kind of thing on dead people during Operation Desert Storm.
 I actually wrote a report on it, but my commander refused to pass it on up to Saddam.
 Kooky times.
 But I can't die, Dr.
 Spaceman! Who will be there raise my kids if I'm not around to pay someone to raise my kids? Look, making even minor changes to your unhealthy lifestyle would help, like diet and exercise.
 Well, we tried.
 I'm sorry, Tracy.
 But on the bright side, at least your family is financially set for life.
 Now, this could literally kill you Iollipop? Thank you for taking in Miss Maroney, Mr.
 Baker.
 We would have asked you sooner, but we forgot you worked here.
 Thank you for doing this, Danny.
 It's gonna be fun! Yeah, it is.
 It's like we're married! Now, don't you two start bickering like old married folks! Are you okay? It's just I got a haircut, and you didn't even notice.
 Sorry, you get your hair cut every week.
 Excuse me? I don't like your tone.
 And I don't like what you've turned into! I'm not the one who forgot our one-minute anniversary! Finally, as the merger progresses, you'll notice some changes to your benefits, including New Health Care Options I'm sorry, that should read, "Few Health Care Options.
" I've got to redo this.
 You have to talk to Jack! I can't lose my dental.
 There's a hygienist there whose boob sometimes touches my ear! Yeah, go upstairs and tell your boyfriend to help us! Jack is not my boyfriend.
 He is, dot-dot-dot, my husband! Oh, God.
 On your wedding night, did he take you in the French fashion? No, there was a mix-up in St.
 Esclavage, and Jack and I are technically married.
 Oh, my God! That's gross! Did you hear what I asked you before? Liz, you should know that NBC has strict anti-nepotism guidelines.
 If your husband is your boss, then you're both going to have to come to my office and discuss this.
 What? No, it's not real.
 We're getting a divorce.
 That's what Ann Curry and Subhas the janitor tried to tell me.
 That was five years ago.
 No, it's a mistake.
 We are signing something tomorrow.
 Wait, Liz, we can use this.
 Jack needs a divorce.
 You have leverage! What are you talking about? You don't sign any divorce papers until we get the studio back, our full budget, our health insurance Pete, I'm not They shut down your secret bathroom to save on cleaning costs.
 I have to talk to my husband.
 No, no, Bob, we made it very clear.
 You have to buy NBC with everything else.
 Then just don't watch it! What is it, Lemon? I'm trying to negotiate a $30-billion deal.
 That's "billion", with a B.
 Is that right? That seems like way too much.
 Yeah, well, my staff and I are also trying to do our jobs, but we can't without studio space or health insurance or those vegetable chips that I hate and I keep telling Kenneth not to get.
 Let me show you something, Lemon.
 This is our NBC priority pie chart.
 This big red part, you can see, is "The Biggest Loser.
" The yellow slice, our number-two priority Make It 1997 Again Through Science or Magic.
 And the little green part is Everything Else.
 Request denied.
 No.
 Request denial denied.
 You have to make 'TGS' a priority.
 Your show netted $600 last year.
 Your parents had to buy an ad.
 I don't care.
 If I don't get what I deserve, I'm not signing those divorce papers.
 Are you blackmailing me? You should think very carefully about what you're doing right now.
 I am lots.
 Very well.
 We'll do this divorce the hard way.
 But I'm warning you, this isn't my first rodeo, Lemon.
 Well, I've been to a rodeo, too.
 It was a cat rodeo in a gay guy's apartment.
 Hey! What happened to my poster of the Montreal Alouettes? It's signed by Marc Trestman! It's tacky, Danny, just like your mother's stupid chain e-mails.
 Oh, here we go! Oh, my nails are wet! Mr.
 Hornberger Do you and your wife ever fight? Not all the time.
 After her hysterectomy, she was in a coma briefly.
 How do y'all make up? Look, Paula and I love each other, but two people living together it's unnatural.
 And while our children are basically snot silos with BB guns, they do come in handy, as a buffer.
 Is that like being a fluffer? Because I have done that and did not enjoy it.
 Blow-drying animals at a pet salon is hard work.
 No, a buffer is a protective barrier.
 Like pigs have around their delicious testicle meat.
 We can't fight around the kids.
 You see them looking up at you with their little faces, their hair already receding, and you bite your tongue.
 A buffer.
 What is it? Thanks, Jack, for coming to this emergency meeting.
 I'm sorry I'm four hours late, but my alarm clock didn't go off because it died in a cockfight last night.
 Tracy, what can I do for you? Well, it has come to my attention that I'm going to die.
 Oh, please.
 You have nothing to worry about.
 We have Martin Lawrence on a holding deal.
 Look, I don't want anything to happen to my husband.
 But if it did, we have a lot of expenses.
 Estate planning is complicated, what with the government taking half.
 What? That's double taxation! I like you, Angie.
 How can I help? Well, to maintain our standard of living, I need to be able to earn as much as Tracy does.
 And if you need to make millions of dollars but have no real skills or education, the best place to do it is in entertainment.
 I mean, look at me! I can't even find Mexico on a map! Things are a little tight at the company right now.
 But if you want to learn about the entertainment business, I can find you something.
 Oh, yeah.
 I'm willing to start at the bottom.
 There's only thing I won't do, and that's take orders from anyone, ever.
 Hey, Angie.
 What are you doing? I'm sorry, I'm not about to cancel my hair appointment with D'Fwan because I'm your new intern.
 You need to light some incense in here.
 Okay, hang on.
 Who said you're my intern? It was Jack's idea.
 I have to start a career.
 But I'm gonna need next week off to go skiing.
 What? Okay, I see what this is.
 Jack's messing with me.
 We're having a little fight, so he sent you here Excuse me, how is my being here messing with you? Do you have a problem with strong black women? No! Don't you see? That's the kind of exchange Jack wants.
 Angie, an intern's job is to do things like make copies and run errands.
 So I'm like your servant? No, because you're not being paid.
 You're really more like Oh, boy.
 Look, Angie, you don't want to be an intern.
 Don't tell me what I want! And I don't really have time to mentor someone right now, so I don't think this is a good idea.
 I don't understand.
 That white girl just fired you! Come on, D'Fwan! Be a buddy! Hey! Idiot, don't touch the Nothing.
 Love you.
 Look, I made this picture of us! Did you draw that? You might need help.
 That's awful for an adult.
 Well, I think it's great, Kenneth.
 You should hang it on the wall.
 Careful! Don't coddle the boy.
 He can do it.
 Oh, my bones! Now look what you did! You made him afraid! Did I also make you half a man? You're ruining my life! What life? My bones! Lemon, why do I have an appointment with Jeffrey Weinerslav tomorrow morning? Every day that I'm married to you, my life gets worse.
 That Angie thing was real cute, Jack.
 And some of your plan worked.
 Yes, she hated me, and, yes, I mentioned slavery by mistake.
 I knew I could count on you.
 But you also made me her boss.
 So I fired her.
 She chased me around for a while, so I hid in a closet down on News.
 But then Subhas and Ann Curry came in, just going to town on Damn it! Is this a game for you two? I thought you were trying to help my family.
 My family! I'm not a pawn.
 I am a queen! You all are trash, and you know what Angie Jordan does with the trash? She drags it out to the curb for pickup! Angie, I did not I will rip your weave out! It's not a weave! Oh, good God.
 Angie, no! I should never have made you an intern.
 You're a star.
 That's right, I am.
 Entertainment is where untalented people go to get rich.
 And you have all the makings of a reality superstar hair-pullingness, delusions of grandeur, an insanely short fuse, catchphrases.
 It's my way till payday! That's the t-shirt! I should give you your own reality show.
 Friday nights What? That is when 'TGS' or wrestling is on.
 I guess I could reconsider the time slot, in exchange for your signature.
 You know what? I'm calling your bluff.
 You're not giving her a TV show.
 FYI, I am friends with a hilarious fat girl and a crazy-eyed, divorced white lady who wants to be in the music business.
 Oh, I'd watch that! Can D'Fwan be on it? Mm-hmm, with his even gayer boyfriend.
 Okay, fine, give her her own show, and I will watch it on our TV in our house, because I'm not signing anything.
 This is not over! Do you think my meth-addict nephew should be on the show? Yes, please! Pete, you and Paula fight a lot.
 No, I walked into a door! I'm so clumsy! Jack is using 'TGS' as leverage in our divorce.
 He says he's gonna replace us with a reality show about Angie.
 Oh, I'd watch that.
 Obviously! But how do I fight back? Well, first off, you can't back down.
 If you do that, we get nothing.
 I agreed to go to a furniture store instead of watching football one time, and I haven't seen a game since.
 Oh, I hear you.
 I mean, take Danny.
 Please! Then you got to hit 'em where it hurts.
 Find their weakness, and viciously exploit it.
 That's what marriage is.
 Don't even get me started on marriage! Thank you.
 Kenneth, your Danny has something to tell you.
 What is it, Danny? Well, sport, I'm gonna be moving out.
 I don't understand.
 Well, sometimes two people who care about each other just can't live together.
 Oh, no, I get that.
 What I don't get is this is Danny's dressing room.
 I'm gonna be staying at the Y.
 It's that dark place under the bleachers that's shaped like a wishbone.
 But you're my Danny and Jenna.
 And we'll always be Danny and Jenna.
 We just won't be Danny and Jenna together.
 And don't think for one second this means we love you less.
 Know that it means that.
 Well, tell the board we are currently in talks Hold on, please.
 Jonathan, I have asked you not to call me at home after 11:00 or before.
 She what? My husband and I are absolutely so pleased to be underwriting the Jack and Eliz abeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, the Arts, and Feelings.
 Son of a bitch! As embarrassed Americans, Jack and I pledge $5 million to create a new generation of choreographers and puppeteers, "cloons", video artists, and theatrical jugglers who will ask the world, "What is art?" We know what art is! It's paintings of horses! Good morning! How is the happy couple today? Well, it's no surprise we're sitting here.
 You two have always thrown off that "will they or won't they" vibe, and it's been a real hoot to watch your courtship.
 Okeydokey.
 Now, when two employees get married, it is my job to make sure that the employee is not receiving favoritism from his or her boss.
 Favoritism? Really? He's trying to cancel my show! Uh-huh.
 And what about your little announcement last night? Do you know how many fires I had to put out this morning because of you? And what was that voice? It is my imitation of Drew Barrymore's impression of that crazy lady! Let's keep this meeting short.
 Our marriage is a technicality, and it will be remedied.
 Also, in order for there to be favoritism, we'd have to actually still be friends.
 All righty, let's just dive on in! "Does the employee spend an inordinate amount of time in the employer's office compared to other employees?" Well, yes, I suppose, but only because Miss Lemon is incapable of doing anything on her own.
 Please.
 Half the time when I go up there, it's to help you choose a tie, and they're all red or blue! Where I come from, if you have more than two colors on a tie, it means you're looking for a certain kind of bar.
 "Are all workday conversations business-related, or do personal issues often dominate discussion, including, but not limited to, mothers, diarrhea, having babies, problems in the bedroom, neckties, food issues, foot disorders, having it all?" Okay, yes, in the past, we have advised each other.
 For instance, Jack taught me not to wear tan slacks with a tan turtleneck.
 I thought it looked nice, but he rightly pointed out that it made me look like a giant condom.
 And Lemon is the only one of my subordinates who's not afraid to warn me when I'm being too authoritative or handsome.
 Or when you have eye boogers.
 "Have you spent time with each other's families? Have you attended special events together, such as class reunions, birthday or holiday celebrations, weddings, or extended car trips? Are you each others' emergency contacts? Do you ever drink together at work, perhaps while summarizing what you've learned over the day or week? Have you shared intimate details of your fears, hopes, and dreams, both personal and professional? Is this the longest and perhaps most meaningful relationship in your life? Do you often find yourselves thinking the same thing and then saying it at the exact same time?" I'm sorry, Jack.
 I apologize, Lemon.
 I never should have tried to blackmail you.
 I'll sign the papers.
 And I shouldn't have threatened your show.
 I'll leave that to the parental-decency groups.
 And I'll back off on the budget and the bat mitzvahs.
 Okay! Now we're gonna do word association.
 "Foreplay.
" We're done, Weinerslav.
 Try to walk like a woman, Lemon.
 Your fly's open, Jack.
 I'm Angie.
 I think elegance and attitude are the same thing.
 And I have IBS.
 I'm D'Fwan! And I just want to be accepted for who I am, a sexual maniac! Hey, I'm Portia.
 I don't care what anyone says.
 I keep them 3D glasses! I'm Randi, with an I.
 My ex-husband's new girlfriend is cheating on him with me! Do you have any meth? Or meth? It's my way till payday! [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Doesn't matter how long you've lived in New York.
 It's still fun to look up and pretend all the buildings are giant severed robot penises.
 Be quiet, Lemon.
 It's happening.
 Wow.
 Out with GE, in with KableTown.
 Seems like one of us should sing "The Circle Game" right now.
 Now it's on to Phase Two.
 I am like Keats' stout Cortez, staring at the Pacific with a wild surmise and daring to imagine what new planets might swim into my ken.
 So will we be getting new employee IDs? 'Cause I'd really like to retake my photo.
 Good God.
 What happened? I was holding in a snart, and then right when she took the photo Don't you want to know what a snart is? I can tell you now! It's 10:00! FYI, Tracy is phoning it in today.
 What else is new? No, mother, literally.
 Are you also staying at this hotel? Line! Tracy, we've been playing this game for five years now.
 When is it ever gonna stop? I don't know.
 After I win a bunch of awards for my movie, it's not gonna get better.
 I don't see how it could get any worse.
 Good question, Liz Lemon.
 When you win an Oscar, it opens up an elite level of actor craziness throwing telephones at hotel employees, speaking to the UN about some messed-up crap in Africa, and I'm definitely getting a private island.
 You're getting an island? Every crazy A-lister owns an island Nicolas Cage, Celine Dion, Charles Widmore.
 This is a whole new world in front of me, LL.
 I'm like Stout Cortez.
 He's my gardener.
 He's easily amazed.
 You have two choices here.
 Either you can stay in your room like a child, or you can get out there and do your job.
 Thank you.
 Oh, I'm sorry, that was misleading.
 I'm not gonna rehearse.
 I'm gonna get a sandwich and then eat it on the toilet.
 What are you wearing? My NBC Page dress blues.
 I want to look good in case I get on-camera.
 On what camera? Well, Mrs.
 Jordan's reality show is gonna be following Mr.
 Jordan around while he's at work.
 What? I know.
 Isn't it exciting? I've never been on TV before.
 I hope I photograph okay, because when I look into a mirror, there's just a white haze.
 Who told Tracy he could bring cameras here? Well, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I couldn't put the memo in your mailbox because it's full of unread adoption materials.
 Yeah.
 Hey, are the reality cams here? God, Lutz! Why? What? I don't want tush lines! You know, I have enough problems with Tracy.
 I don't need cameras following him around while he's here.
 Do you know what pays for your show, Lemon? Our product-placement deal with Sullivan Psychiatric Clinic.
 "Sullivan Psychiatric.
 You'll drool over our crazy prices.
" Reality TV a woman with hundruplets, a live execution, "The Real Transvestite Hoarders of Orange County Penitentiary.
" That show is upsetting.
 Why does the Warden let Lady Extravaganza have so many spoons? Programs like that are the lifeblood of this industry.
 They're cheap, promotable, and, even if they're terrible, you get a rating and move on to the next idea.
 Everybody wins.
 Well, I happen to think we are in a new Golden Age of scripted television.
 Shh! Shh! Lemon, it's okay.
 As I begin Phase Two of my Jack Attack on KableTown, I've been doing some research.
 Do you know what the most successful reality events of the past five years are? Celebrity benefits for natural disasters.
 The viewership is huge.
 Yes, but those ratings mean nothing.
 All the networks air those benefits at the same time.
 So no one gets an advantage.
 True.
 Unless only one network is carrying it because only one network is ready to broadcast a benefit on the night of the disaster.
 But that's impossible.
 There's not enough time to put it together.
 Unless you've pretaped the show beforehand and filmed options for every possible disaster scenario.
 You're going to pretape a benefit for a disaster that hasn't happened yet? Yeah.
 That is bad karma, Jack.
 I mean, this morning, I stole a cab from a pregnant lady on crutches, and I am just waiting for My goodness, Lemon.
 The people affected will still get money, but so will NBC.
 Everybody wins! Oh, and I need Jenna to sing.
 I'll do it! But I hate my dress! All right, listen up, everybody.
 I need ideas from you people for potential natural disasters, anything that might require a televised celebrity benefit.
 I need something new, and I need it by the end of the day, so Lets get to work.
 Well, I just finished a screenplay where a tidal wave destroys Washington.
 Someone write down "tidal wave"! Shut him up! What about a tornado that hits a handgun factory and it's just spinning around, shooting handguns? What happens when the Second Flood comes and you aren't allowed on Reverend Gary's ark? Especially since Reverend Gary made it clear the ark is just for teenage boys.
 You know, with global weirding and everything, stuff like that could totally happen here.
 There was a cyclone in Brooklyn last year.
 It destroyed two vintage t-shirt stores and a banjo.
 If something does happen, it'll probably be while we're at work.
 I mean, this is where we spend all of our time.
 We should have a plan in place.
 If we don't, I will freak out and start karate-kicking people.
 Everyone needs an emergency plan.
 For instance, right before the ark leaves, I'm supposed to castrate Reverend Gary! I see you finally decided to come to work.
 Of course.
 I'm just continuing my consistent professional behavior.
 Let's laugh together, friend.
 What's going on with him? First of all, good morning.
 And to answer your question, it's Angie's cameras.
 These reality shows want crazy behavior, so Tracy's keeping it boring, give them nothing that could make him look bad.
 Since when does Tracy care about looking bad? Since he got nominated for an Oscar.
 Then, once he wins, it's on to the next level, which I am not looking forward to.
 That island he wants to buy is filled with scorpions.
 Let's do it again from the top! I want to get it perfect because Perfection is my middle name! Unclaimed Perfection Baby Boy! So, here's the plan if anything happens, we meet outside under the Atlas statue, walk to the 59th Street Bridge, and try to get to my mom's house in Queens.
 Okay, good.
 We've got a wide skill set for any post-apocalyptic scenario.
 I'm good at archery and kind of want to die.
 I can use my glasses to start a fire.
 Toofer can get us through black-, gay-, and nerd-controlled neighborhoods.
 Cerie will be some sort of queen in the new society.
 I will do sex with cannibals as needed.
 I can talk to animals.
 Well, not talk to them.
 I can take commands from them.
 Lutz.
 What can he do? Well, he's slow and a coward.
 I'm not useless.
 I mean, I've got a car.
 Oh.
 I didn't know that.
 All right, Lutz is the driver.
 Wait, how big is your car? Can it fit all of us? Oh, right.
 It's actually pretty small.
 I could only take three of you.
 So I'll have to choose.
 That sucks.
 It's like a reality show where you guys get to compete for a seat in my car by proving how much you like me.
 Tracy, I need you to do something.
 Of course, friend.
 Teamwork is the key to success.
 Yeah, you need to stay late for a wardrobe fitting tonight.
 It should take about two hours.
 Okay.
 No problem.
 After that, I need you to record that DVD commentary that you've been putting off for five years.
 Hope you didn't have plans tonight.
 No.
 I wasn't gonna buy two blimps and crash them into each other to see what sound they made.
 Look, is there anything you two could maybe fight about? An argument that culminates in a racial slur would be lovely.
 Sorry, this is gonna be nice and boring.
 Tracy's even going to agree to attend a fund-raiser for my cousin's dance studio.
 Aren't you, Tracy? So, we're good? Never better.
 I'm happy as a clam that wants to kill some woman.
 Great.
 You're the best.
 Love you.
 Love you more! Boy, I don't know, Jack.
 This just doesn't feel right.
 Bob, it's for charity, and if you don't do it, I'll have MSNBC tell the world you grew up in England.
 But I'm so identified with New York, you bloody tosser! Bob.
 Okay.
 Disaster options, take one.
 We'll always remember where we were when we heard that tornado had hit a handgun factory.
 Two days ago, when people thought of a mudslide, they just thought of getting drunk in an Applebee's.
 But now we know it as the thing that destroyed Denver.
 When the birds first started attacking us, we all thought it was pretty funny and made Hitchcock jokes.
 But we're not laughing now.
 Because our laughter excites the birds sexually.
 This devastating wildfire.
 This horrible flood.
 This wonderful flood that put out that devastating wildfire.
 These super-intelligent sharks Tracy.
 I just thought of a few more things I need from you.
 Shut your mouth I am finished taking orders from you And I think that you're a four-eyed douche Tracy, I don't want to interrupt this moment.
 This is great stuff, but that's Billy Joel's.
 Anything you sing to that tune I can't use on the show.
 That's too bad But if I sing, you cannot do anything To make me look bad on your TV show And also let me say that Liz is a ho A dirty ho You are a child And you're losing your mind I want to kick you I'm not good at making up songs Unlike me who is good As you can tell From this rhyme Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh The thing that happened was so sad We can't believe it got so bad When the stuff we know occurred went down So find it in your heart Step up and do your part And help the people the thing that happened happened to Help the people The thing that happened Happened to Fantastic, Jenna.
 You really brought the songwriting computer's words to life.
 Wow.
 You're actually doing this.
 Yes, all I'm missing is the disaster.
 Well, I'm in the middle of a Tracy disaster.
 I thought I could use Angie's cameras to make him behave, but he found a loophole.
 And now, to close it, I need $80,000 to buy the rights to "Uptown Girl.
" Lemon, it sounds like you're trying to fight crazy with crazy.
 Yeah, because crazy is the only language that Tracy is fluent in.
 But you'll never outcrazy Tracy.
 So why don't you have it out with him once and for all, like two adults? Because we're not two adults, Jack.
 One of us is an actor.
 And actors are not people.
 Someone get a PA to feed me baby food, or I will drop a D in the greenroom! Yeah, last week you thought I was crying wolf, didn't you? Lutz is the best.
 Nice feet, Lutz.
 I like Lutz the most.
 Look at all of you trying to impress me.
 I feel like The Bachelor! But to whom shall I give my rose? It's so hard to choose when everyone loves me so much.
 But only three of you can ride to safety in my car.
 I don't really have a car.
 Tracy, your little singing game is over.
 I got Auto-Tune for my computer, and if you try to sing, I'll just take out the melody, and no one has to pay for that.
 Liz Lemon won, do do do do That was me singing The Beatles' "Here Comes the Sun" for free.
 LL, please.
 I'm way ahead of you.
 And I'm not rehearsing.
 I'm going to shoot garden gnomes with a handgun at Tupac's house.
 Yeah, Tupac is alive.
 I bet you'd like to have that on your show.
 Yes, Tracy, obviously! But, again, I can't use any of it when you're wearing that mask.
 The Rangers logo is trademarked.
 Okay, fine.
 Jack was right.
 I can't outcrazy you.
 So we're gonna talk.
 Right now.
 No cameras.
 All right, Tracy.
 The kid gloves are coming off.
 Oh, that explains it.
 Those are gloves.
 No wonder they're so coarse and wrinkly.
 Five years ago, I rescued your career.
 And how do you repay me? By making my life harder at every turn.
 You are late.
 You blow off rehearsals.
 And your online-romance prank was not funny.
 I fell in love with you! You wore a yellow hat to that coffee shop! You know what's actually funny about all this? You think I'm the problem.
 Have you ever tried to work with you? Really? You're trying to blame me? Five years ago, I saved your show.
 I rode in here on a white horse that you made me leave in the lobby! All you do is stifle me when you should be thanking me! Oh, yeah, I should be thanking you.
 Without me, do you have any idea where you would be right now? This Honky Grandma be trippin' over SurfMaster's mid-range Jet Skis! Where do you think you would be without me? Now, Jerry, in rehearsal, it's okay to play with yourself, but when we do the show Hey, dummy, you got to drive me to paintball.
 And no complaining.
 The only reason why I got that DUI is 'cause it was your birthday.
 What's up, Jerry? That's awesome.
 Well, at least Jerry bothered to come to rehearsal! And, in my alternate reality, Dennis dies, and I win the lottery! But then I will run you over with a Jet Ski! Damn it! Jonathan, come in here! Fantastic news! There's been a natural disaster! Was it in Indian Kashmir? May Durga's trident pierce them from the skies! No, a typhoon just hit an island in the South Pacific and News is going to full-time coverage.
 It's perfect.
 The island is called Mago.
 It's near Fiji.
 Heavy structural damage, no fatalities sad, but not too sad.
 We'll get footage of beautiful Polynesian people, proud and topless.
 Maybe a pelican near some diapers, I don't know.
 It's all happening so fast! We haven't even given this plan a code name! Haven't we? Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning is a go! Really? You're trying to blame me? Five years ago, I saved your show! Okay, first of all, I look weird there because I'm snarting.
 You snarted in my dressing room? And second of all, I said no cameras! That footage cannot be shown on television.
 I'm trying to buy an island over here! I'm sorry, Tray, but now I just need a heartfelt resolution.
 So we're gonna use a little reality-TV magic.
 We call it staging it, or lying.
 We shoot you guys meeting in the hallway, you apologize, you hug.
 You are disgusting.
 And I have absolutely no reason to apologize to him.
 And I have no reason to hug her, other than my love of having boobs pressed against me! If I hugged you, I would angle it so that you got no boob! And I would anticipate your angling, and I would get there! I would get there.
 Yah! Hey, buddy! I made you an Apocalypse Road Trip mix.
 I hope your car has a CD player.
 Pfft, it has two.
 And it has flames on the side.
 Lutzy, guess what.
 A friend of mine works for Marvel, and he got me four tickets to a test screening of "Captain America" tonight! Nice! Chris Evans' body looks amazing in the trailer! When's his "Men's Health" cover? Okay, so, who are you gonna take with you besides Frank? Dude, make up your mind.
 We have to be in Harrison by 6:00.
 Wait.
 It's in New Jersey? How are we getting to New Jersey? You're going to drive us, obviously.
 What am I gonna do? Where have you been, sir? Have you seen the news? I don't have to, Jonathan.
 I know what's on it the poor people of Mago Island and their brave shorts-wearing police force.
 If you're just joining us, this is NB C's continuing coverage of the devastation in Mago, the Fijian island owned by controversial actor Mel Gibson.
 Good God.
 We are receiving reports of extensive damage to the main house as well as the house for Gibson's cars.
 No word yet on the fate of Gibson's collection of anti-Semitic and misogynistic literature.
 No! No, this is not a prank, this is Jack Donaghy, and I'm calling about Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning! Hello? We are joined now by a relative of the island's owner, Oskar Gibson.
 G'day.
 First off, the Holocaust never happened.
 We go now to NB C's exclusive prime-time benefit for the victims of the devastation in Mago, specifically, Mel Gibson and his houseguest, Jon Gosselin.
 Why do bad things happen to good people? We'll never know.
 But look at these pictures.
 Look at these beautiful souls.
 And pick up the phone.
 Every dollar you give to help Mel Gibson.
  will go towards rebuilding His sex Jacuz zi.
 And help the people The thing that happened Happened to Here he comes! Pick me, Lutzy! Pick me! Now, you can't all fit, so Dude, did you just buy that car? What? There's a dealer sticker in the window, you got no plates, and you made these flames out of magic marker and tape.
 I'd rather die than ride with him.
 Let's go.
 Okay, but now I do have a car! So everything is like it was before! It's all like it was before! And help the people The thing that happened Happened to Help the We now return to "Queen of Jordan.
" You heard me! What the hell? Tracy, I need you.
 Of course, friend.
 So, we're good? Never better.
 You're the best.
 Love you.
 Love you more! Let's never fight again.
 No, never, Tracy.
 I know it's fake, but Damn it, I miss him! I knew I'd get that boob squish! Tracy, I'm sorry.
 Don't.
 You already said it all on the show.
 You said it all.
 I got there.
 I'm angling.
 I'm angling.
 Hey.
 Are you okay? Aw, you're kidding.
 Your dumb stunt worked? It was our highest rating since that episode of "S VU" where the detectives watched "American Idol.
" It was a train wreck! It was reality TV.
 It can be good, it can be terrible.
 It just can't be anything in between.
 You know, some people actually craft stories.
 And when the story doesn't have an ending, you don't just create one out of thin air by playing music or having people give each other meaningful looks.
 Sure, that might manipulate an audience into thinking they're feeling something, but it sucks! [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Back to the top.
 One more time, guys.
 Everyone, I need your attention! Gather up! I said everyone, Sketch-Tron 6000.
 Mr.
 Hank Hooper, the owner of our new parent company, KableTown, is touring 30 Rock for the first time today.
 I will make a good first impression, so I need all of you to be your most normal.
 Tracy, do not mention where you think dinosaurs come from.
 Do not mention the underwater city of Sauronicon, got it.
 Jenna, get all of your crazy yelling out of your system.
 If you don't volumize my hair, I will choke you to death with your boyfriend's wig! Very good.
 Frank, how's your armpit thing? Not great.
 It's almost touching my thigh thing.
 Okay, let's do our best.
 Remember, everyone, just don't be yourselves.
 Lemon, meet me in my office in 10.
 I need to ask you something.
 Do you need sex advice? Here's a tip.
 Sometimes, a lady likes to leave her blazer on.
 Sir, ma'am, this is for you a gift bag.
 "To my two favorite sketch stars.
 Your new friend, Hank Hooper.
" That's nice.
 Actors deserve gifts.
 Without us, who would present awards to actors? So, which one of us is gonna get this computer? Just kidding, we both are! Wow, I always wanted one of these! The box will make a perfect coffin for my teddy bear! There's two of everything! Look at us.
 When we met four years ago, we were fighting about the silliest things dressing rooms, air time, you coming in and ruining my show.
 You taking my nephew's virginity.
 I feel we finally found a balance in our relationship.
 There's only one.
 You take it.
 I don't care.
 I want you to selfishly take the best sweatshirt in the world! Lemon, this is a little delicate, but I wonder if you might take Avery shopping for baby things.
 Oh.
 Sure.
 You know, a crib, small clothes, a tiny desk with a miniature pen set on it.
 I don't know a lot about babies, but I know that Avery would enjoy having another woman go with her.
 Of course.
 I'm just a little surprised.
 I assumed Avery would have a terrifying best friend she'd do stuff like that with.
 Avery does have a sister, but Eugenia is currently institutionalized for nerves.
 Lesbian.
 And all of her work friends are out because she's still trying to keep her pregnancy a secret.
 Really? She's eight months.
 How is she possibly hiding it? Michael Kors is a friend.
 We own a gay racehorse together.
 And I convinced him to make wizard cloaks fashionable for ladies this winter.
 It's my fault for asking.
 The problem is that Avery is very close to being named the financial reporter for "NBC Nightly News.
" If anyone finds out she's pregnant, she won't get the job.
 See? That would never happen if men could get pregnant, which is the premise of my one-act play, "The Sea Horses of Warwickshire Abbey.
" Avery just needs to keep her condition under wraps until her contract is signed.
 Unfortunately, her competition for the job is Carmen Chao from MSNBC.
 Oh, I know her! Hey, what ethnicity is she? No one knows.
 In international news, Mexican President Felipe Calderón is traveling this week to China to meet with Premier Wen Jiabao and then stopping for a well-deserved vacation in Negril, Jamaica, mon! If Carmen finds out Avery is pregnant, she'll use it to destroy her.
 Carmen's very sneaky.
 And that's not racist because I don't know what she is.
 Man, we all lead such complicated lives.
 Hey, do you want to go to that new popcorn place for lunch? I'm going to the Executive Dining Room to meet with Hank Hooper.
 I can't wait to shake his hand.
 You can tell a lot about someone by their handshake.
 You are confident.
 And you ate dinner in front of a mirror last night.
 Carol's away a lot.
 Ahoy there, Jack! Hank Hooper.
 Nice to meet you.
 I'm a hugger! Nope! It doesn't count as a hug unless it goes on for 10 seconds! Yeah.
 Well, it is an honor, sir, to finally I'm no sir, Jack.
 Call me Hank or "Hey, idiot," like my wife does.
 Kidding.
 She's an angel! 'Sup, Jack? What are you doing here? No, it's fine, Jack.
 KableTown's a family company, and where I come from, families eat together! This is no longer the Executive Dining Room.
 It's the Everyone Dining Room! Welcome, everyone! This is where we used to hold retirement parties.
 The balcony below is probably still littered with stripper bones.
 Now there are people here wearing sandals.
 Yeah.
 Well, Isn't that nice? Listen, can I tell you how happy I am with the work you've done for us so far? It's been outstanding.
 Thank you.
 And believe me, I'm not done.
 I'm working on something new right now that I think Room for a single? Sure.
 Let me ask you a question.
 Do you know who came up with the idea for the DVR? It was the guy who drives me home every night.
 The original name for the DVR was "The Thing Carlos Thought Of.
" Since then, I make sure that, once a month, anyone who works here can pitch any idea they have to upper management.
 Anyone? I see.
 So, I want you to hear ideas all day tomorrow and then report back to me.
 I'll be the guy wearing the Bugs Bunny tie! What is this green stuff? Wipe it off! Wipe it off! These pregnancy photos are so tacky.
 They're like those knockoff bags you get in Chinatown.
 Really? I like my Pradar bag.
 Avery Jessup.
 ¡ Qué sorpresa! Carmen.
 What are you doing here? Oh, I just love babies.
 Love their creepy little hands and the way they crawl fast like a rat monster.
 The question is, what are you doing here? Oh, she's here with me.
 I'm pregnant, and Avery is helping me decide what kind of baby megaphone to buy.
 Really? You're the pregnant one? Yeah.
 Some dude jacked me, and now his sperm is growing in my stomach.
 That's not how babies are made.
 No, we're gonna go.
 You're tired.
 Oh, you'll find this interesting.
 I'm working on a story right now about single mothers in their 40s.
 That's a great idea.
 So you'll be in it? Why wouldn't you be? You just said it was a great idea, and you're pregnant, right? So, by the Law of Verbal Traps, you have to do it.
 Okay, Carmen.
 I'll be in your story.
 You can interview me at the new popcorn place on 11th Avenue.
 No, we'll do it at your office.
 Fine.
 I'll just go to the popcorn place alone, even though all their advertising suggests it is a place for groups of friends to have a good time.
 Hello.
 Good sweatshirt to you.
 How are you sweatshirting this sweatshirt? Is everything all right, Tracy? I want that sweatshirt! No! You can't take this away from me, like you took away my show and my grandmother's jewelry chest! Was I supposed to throw up in something of mine? You gave this to me.
 And I could take it back! I'm the star here! And if there's only one sweatshirt, the star should have it.
 Look how gray it is! Just let me hold it for one second! Well okay.
 But just one second.
 You'll never get her! Stop! Sweatshirty is a boy! Miss Lemon, Carmen Chao called about an interview.
 Is she doing an exposé on how feminism has led to a happiness crisis among educated women? No, Kenneth, it's nothing.
 I'm gonna call Jack and make it go away.
 Check this out! I was up in the Everybody Dining Room sharing a table with B-Dubs here, and guess what he told me.
 Okay, gossip alert! According to my colleague Carmen Chao, our friend Liz Lemon is pregnant! Dude, is that true? Are you pregnant? Isn't that wonderful news? Lemon told me this morning.
 She got jacked big-time.
 Lemon, a word? What the hell is going on? Thank you for covering for Avery last night, but now you're part of this.
 And Carmen Chao is relentless, like a bloodhound perhaps literally.
 We still don't know her genetic background.
 So, what? Now people think I'm pregnant? Do I have to do this mom news story? There is no news story.
 Carmen isn't getting anywhere with Avery, so she's trying to call your bluff.
 Well, it is called.
 I am telling everyone here that there's no way I could be pregnant because I have had my period for the last 61 days.
 Lemon, please.
 Avery's career has never been more important.
 Because I just don't know what's happening with mine.
 What? Why? The Everyone Dining Room, open office hours, memos with emoticons in them! If this is how KableTown does business, I don't know if I have a future here.
 I'm Jack Donaghy.
 Don Geiss gave me this watch for firing a man on his deathbed! So, wait, you might leave? I don't know if I can survive here.
 So I need you to fake being pregnant to help my family.
 I'm asking you as a friend.
 How come when I try to get you to go to a murder-mystery party with me, it's all, "We're business colleagues, Lemon"? I don't know why I ever choose you as a friend.
 Let's just be clear about this.
 I chose you.
 I heard the blessed news, Liz! May I kiss your stomach? Absolutely not.
 Hello, beautiful.
 It's Uncle Wutzy.
 Oh, hey, Jack, you and I have a pitch meeting later.
 You're a baby.
 Yes, you are! Yes, you're a So, that's basically the show.
 And my sidekick is a hot black chick who can read minds.
 We need a button that switches from pornography to basketball immediately.
 What you have isn't fast enough.
 My kids are starting to ask questions that I can't answer! This'll just be a minute.
 Did you check the light bulb? Please do not use that tone.
 So much of television is really not fit for children or Christians or the elderly.
 So, what if there was a black bar on the lower half of your TV screen that kept you from seeing bad things, like nudity or soccer? Congratulations.
 Worst so far.
 Liz, I never get anything! All I want is one sweatshirt! Don't listen to her! She's not me! What is going on? This is mine! The story begins when dolphins ruled the Earth.
 Hey, guys, lay off Liz, okay? You know, she's pregnant.
 Really? Yeah.
 Super pregnant.
 Congratulations.
 I am not interested in godfather duties.
 Now's not the time to discuss this, but I will need to eat your umbilical cord.
 I'm sorry we were stressing you out.
 We shouldn't do that.
 It'll turn the child into a Dracula.
 I'm sorry.
 You know what? Give me the sweatshirt.
 Problem solved.
 Now no one gets it.
 Pregnant! Now, get out of here! And hold hands like best friends on the way out! Wow.
 That is like magic.
 People are nice to pregnant ladies.
 I'm gonna run downstairs.
 Do you want anything? Remember, you're eating for two.
 Well, I guess two egg sandwiches times two is four.
 Good morning.
 So, how did Co-worker Pitch Day go, Jack? Well, Employee Pitch Day was, of course, a new experience for me.
 Speaking of new experiences, I ate at an Indian restaurant last night! I had naan! Sir I mean, Hank.
 I appreciate that you have your way of doing things, but so do I.
 I am a Six Sigma Black Belt Ultra with the groin branding to prove it.
 What's Six Sigma? A rock band? I'd like to start this meeting by sharing one of my own ideas.
 And after you hear it, maybe we can agree that Employee Pitch Day is time that could be better spent drinking and looking out the window.
 Okay, Jack.
 You're putting it on the line.
 What have you got? Hank, what's the one part of the television experience that's not perfect? To me, it's the remote control.
 Too easy to lose, right? Yes! I lose my remote all the time.
 Grr, couch cushions! What if you didn't need a remote control because your remote control was your own voice? Television on! Channel NBC!  crew out of the Bronx called the Ace of Deuces.
 Amazing! I give you Voice Activation.
 Word from my C.
I.
 Is he got offed by That shouldn't happen.
 TV on.
 Voice Activation, or Vo-Act The only wit we have is some mute kid Unmute! My friends at the DEA say these guys have a high volume of cocaine  coming in from the docks.
 Low volume! Low volume! But first I want to go home and delete everything that's on my D VR.
 Oh, come on! TV mute! Jack, that doesn't seem to work.
 You got any other notions, or should we jump to employee ideas? No, no.
 No.
 I have another idea.
 What if What if you had a black bar at the bottom of the screen that prevented you from seeing anything dirty? I like that.
 I like that a lot.
 It would allow parents to eliminate racy content, like soccer or a woman stuffing a turkey! That's a real family-company kind of idea, Jack.
 And we could sell ads in the black bar, increase our revenue streams! You could call it "BlaBar.
" A-plus work, Jack! I don't need to hear anything else.
 If that's the kind of ideas you're bringing nine, ten you will go far, son! Yeah.
 Crap! Kenneth, we need to talk.
 Earlier today, I told Hank Hooper about your black-bar concept, and he loved it.
 However, I presented it as my own idea.
 Wonderful! Next topic! What? No, this is an opportunity for you.
 You have me over a barrel.
 What are you going to do? Not what my uncle does when he gets a hitchhiker over a barrel, I'll tell you that! This is business, Kenneth.
 All bosses steal from their employees.
 But in return, the employee gets something.
 You didn't steal anything from me, sir.
 Last time I checked, best friends can't steal from each other.
 Now, stop being a Silly Simon! This isn't how it works! You're the one being a Silly Simon! Carmen.
 What are you doing here? Well, you didn't call back to schedule our interview, so I thought I'd just ambush you with some pregnancy questions.
 I hope you're not unprepared.
 Of course not.
 When are you due? April 20th, Hitler's birthday.
 What's your pediatrician's name? Dr.
 Rufus T.
 Barleysheath.
 Where was the baby conceived? In my vagina.
 What names are you considering? Rufus T.
 Barleysheath.
 How are you feeling? A little achy and nauseous, but I'm hanging in there.
 Are you pregnant? No way that I'm not.
 Owen.
 Screw.
 I don't know why you're doing this for Jessup.
 She's a blonde.
 Don't you know there's a war going on? Or you're doing it for her old-man husband.
 He's your boss! First of all, Jack means nothing to me.
 Shoot him in the throat and let the dogs eat him, I don't care.
 What? What's wrong with you? Almost everything, but let's get back to the interview.
 We're done with that portion.
 I thought it would be a fun visual if we got some B-roll of you taking sexy pregnancy photos where you bare your stomach like the pregnant bitch that you are.
 What do you say? Let's take some pictures.
 an innovation that is both family- and bottom-line friendly.
 Gentlemen, I give you BlaBar.
 You're really sexing me right now.
 It's filthy.
 Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! One time, I saw a turtle Who the hell do you think you are? This is not the way the world works, Kenneth.
 Bosses steal, and employees use it for leverage.
 So, what do you want? Money? A promotion? I can get you into a restaurant where you watch a child play with a bunny, then you eat the bunny! Isn't that just Easter? And I don't want anything, sir.
 I'm just happy to spend all day here helping my work family.
 Family! I now work for a man who thinks like you! Does he also solve mazes by starting from the end? I need this, Kenneth.
 I used you, now leverage it.
 Blackmail me.
 Demand to sleep with Avery.
 Hit me! Hit me in the face! No, sir! Best friends don't I am ordering you to strike me.
 There will be no retaliation.
 But if you refuse, you're fired.
 No, I don't even know how.
 Do it! Hit me now! Oh, damn my Krav Maga training and lightning reflexes.
 Release me, you hillbilly Circe! I am life! Revel in the glory of motherhood! Gaia flows through me! Rufus T.
 Barleysheath is kicking! I know you're not pregnant! Why don't you just admit it? She's grabbing oil! Owen, run! Look how my belly glistens! What's going on, Jack? I was just about to hop on my bus back to Philadelphia.
 I don't fly, but I've got my own bus with a pool table in it.
 We'll drive to Branson together sometime, take in a Yakov Smirnoff show.
 Doesn't Russia sound like a crazy place? Yes, sir, but before you go, I want you to meet someone.
 This is Kenneth Parcell, one of our pages.
 Well, I didn't notice you there, son.
 You do not have a lot of charisma! Kenneth is the one who came up with the BlaBar idea, not me.
 I'm sorry I misled you.
 Oh.
 Well, Jack, I have to say I'm surprised.
 Here is my letter of resignation.
 It's probably for the best, since this is obviously not a good fit.
 If you call security to escort me out, you should know I have several pistols hidden on me.
 Hold on, Jack.
 No one's quitting.
 I'm impressed you told me that.
 You have a reputation, Jack, as a shark.
 KableTown we're not sharks.
 We're more like whatever the friendliest fish is.
 I'm not a science guy.
 The point is, I wasn't sure how you were gonna fit in.
 But you doing something like this tells me we're gonna be just fine.
 Very well.
 Good.
 And Jack should give you something for that idea, son.
 Finally, thank you! Quid pro quo.
 But I don't want anything.
 No? How about a hug? You've got to be kidding me.
 Sir it doesn't count as a hug unless it goes on for 10 seconds! You got that right, son! One Mississippi That's some good hugging.
 And as excited as I am to be joining the team on "Nightly News," I will miss my dear friends here on basic cable.
 But, Carmen, you have an exciting new assignment, right? Yes.
 I will be covering hurricanes.
 Thank you, Lemon.
 I owe you.
 If you want to make it up to me, I have my eye on a toilet pillow from a certain medical-supply store.
 Avery and I want the baby's middle name to be Elizabeth, after you.
 Oh, Jack, that's so gayballs.
 Hey, Liz.
 Can we get you anything? Do you need some liniment rubbed on your perineum? No, guys, I'm not really pregnant.
 I was just pretending, to help Jack.
 Why would you pretend to help Jack? Help him for real.
 It takes the same amount of time! No, Tracy, she lied to us.
 And she ordered us around like we were a couple of normals! You will be punished.
 Can I have my nunchakus back? Or we could call it even.
 Good God.
 I have been punished.
 These are yours to keep.
 What? Who's the black guy? A bicycle messenger.
 You took your pants off! What if there was a channel that's just the sounds of people having a party so you could put it on when you call your parents? You know what my TV is? A sunset.
 How about a button you push on your remote and you can buy anything you see on TV? Like if you're watching "Sex and the City," and you just have to have Mr.
 Big's spaghetti.
 What if we executed someone live on TV? and then I pull off my mask, and I'm a Lizard Person, too! Blackout.
 End of episode.
 [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Hey, do you have a neck pillow? I blew mine up, and now it smells like my mouth.
 I never sleep on planes.
 I don't want to get incepted.
 Are you going somewhere? Carol has a flight to Raleigh-Durham so I'm going with him.
 And we're gonna drive out and spend a few days at an inn in Nags Head.
 You're going to Nags Head? Isn't that redundant? "You're going to Nags Head? Isn't that redundant?" "You will hand me an envelope predicting my joke about Nags Head.
" That is solid.
 Avery and I are also having a little romantic weekend together before the baby comes.
 We're going to Toronto for the G8 Economic Summit.
 It's going to be very erotic.
 Look at us, being all adulty.
 I packed underwear that isn't gray! Isn't it nice dating someone you have so much in common with? Like you, Avery is a Type-A nutjob.
 And, of course, you and Carol share your trademark stubbornness.
 We're not "stubborn".
 We're principled.
 Have a nice trip, Lemon.
 Break out those underpants.
 But be careful.
 Dating yourself is a double-edged sword.
 It means you also share the same flaws.
 Well, that would only be a problem if I had any flaws.
 Not only is your fly open, there's a pencil is sticking out of it.
 Good day to you, sir.
 Tracy, congratulations on EGOT-ing.
 You've got an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony.
 You are more talented than I.
 You're ready, Mirror Jenna.
 Tracy, congratulations on The Empire State Building will be lit in the color of your choosing.
 Clear.
 Sea World will now let you borrow a killer whale for Spring Break.
 I'll need a whale saddle.
 And Steven Spielberg wants you to star in his next movie.
 Kate Capshaw's husband? Tracy, congratulations.
 I loved your acceptance speech.
 Tracy Jordan asked me to accept this on his behalf because his mouth is full.
 Pop Tart! So I guess you've made it to the "next level".
 I look forward to seeing how this empowers you to make my life more difficult.
 As am I, Liz Lemon.
 It will probably involve the guitar-playing chimpanzee that I bought this morning.
 No.
 Uh, hold on.
 Dotcom is confirming that he drowned.
 Why are you putting me in a suit? I still haven't memorized my Torah passage! Oh, you're going to a lunch for the Council on Poverty.
 And this afternoon you're speaking at the Clinton Foundation.
 "Speaking"? That doesn't sound like me.
 That sounds like work.
 Yeah, well, the next level isn't all fun.
 Success is a double-edged sword.
 You're actually respected now.
 Like it or not, people are gonna expect you to use that power for good.
 Come on, sir.
 Arms.
 There's a line, sir.
 I realize you're more important than everyone else on the flight, what with those Jets sweatpants Excuse me, young lady.
 Are you old enough to be traveling alone? I don't know.
 I'm going to visit my Nana, but I'm scared.
 Wait, that's too young.
 Roger that.
 Look at sweatpants guy.
 This is a $90-million aircraft, not a Tallahassee strip club.
 Stewart, 2118 that guy.
 Excuse me, Mr.
 Sweatpants.
 We're gonna need to check that bag.
 And that is Sky Law.
 Hey.
 I'm going to Raleigh for a business meeting.
 I'm a businessman.
 I'm not an air marshal.
 Good afternoon, folks.
 This is Captain Burnett from the flight deck.
 There's some traffic on the runway.
 Should be about a half-hour, and then we'll have you on your way.
 So sit back, relax, enjoy your flight.
 Thanks for choosing Air Bike.
 The pilot is my boyfriend.
 So if you have any questions during the flight, maybe I can There's a man on the wing! We haven't taken off yet.
 It's just a mechanic.
 And this is the Prime Minister's suite.
 Oh, there it is.
 The Metro Toronto Convention Centre, site of the G8 Summit.
 Let's do it on the balcony.
 You might have to start without me.
 No problem.
 Well, if you need anything else Oh, God, you're breaking the extra bone all Canadians have in their hands! Jack, I think the baby's coming! What? You're not due until March! Why did I buy a beryllium mine if her birthstone isn't going to be aquamarine? We need to get to the airport! Airport? We need to get you to a hospital.
 No, we can't go to a hospital! This is Canada! If she's born here Good God.
 She'll be Canadian! At the risk of sounding incredibly rude, I would beg your pardon and ask you, in your opinion, what's so bad about being Canadian? Your milk comes in bags.
 Bags! Your pavilion at EPCOT doesn't have a ride! And if Canada is so nice and friendly, why does most of our meth come from your Asian drug gangs? Are we not even making our own meth? What is happening to American manufacturing? Take our things downstairs and get us a car to the airport! Oh, my God.
 Jack, if our child is born here, she can't be President Don't even say it.
 We're having an American.
 And she will be President, no matter how ridiculous that sentence sounds.
 If only we were in Kenya right now, we'd be fine.
 If this is helping you, I'm fine.
 And, in conclusion, bless you, Tracy Jordan.
 Your gripping portrayal of D'Jeffrey "Lucky" Seeda in "Hard to Watch" has given a voice to the voiceless America's poor.
 I'm not scared of you people! And I don't think those cashews look like a bowl of baby penises! Being an EGOT is fun! Here's to me spending the rest of my life in rooms like this! Didn't they say half-an-hour over an hour ago? Excuse me.
 While we're waiting to take off, we're going to go ahead and begin our in-flight entertainment, which is the feature film "Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole.
" And NBC sitcoms that didn't make the schedule.
 We have to find the Guardians, Eglantine! Hey.
 Oh, hey, Lizzie.
 You okay? People are starting to get a little antsy back there.
 Yeah, it's gonna be about another half-an-hour.
 Really? 'Cause I checked Flight Tracker on my phone, and our status is just an angry red frowny face.
 Okay, you want to know a little pilot secret, besides the fact that we get a discount at Sunglass Hut? The "half-hour" thing is a trick.
 It's enough time so that people know they have to wait but it doesn't upset them.
 So you're just lying? That's not right.
 We're paying customers.
 Look, Liz, we have reasons for doing the things the way we do them.
 We say "half-an-hour" to control the herds of walking mozzarella sticks who think that $300 and a photo ID gives them the right to fly through the air like one of the Guardian Owls of legend! God, that's been our in-flight movie for months.
 I just think it's frustrating for people to know that they're being lied to.
 Maybe you just want to fly the plane yourself! Well, good luck pressing "Take Off", then "Autopilot", then "Land".
 Okay.
 This is obviously a tense situation for you.
 I didn't mean to make it worse.
 Just do what you need to do, and we'll get where we're going.
 Nags Head.
 Oh, no, Soren! It's Metalbeak! You have to stay awake, Eglantine.
 All the pure ones will moonblink us.
 About half an hour.
 Canada.
 Every flight is cancelled.
 No.
 I called the concierge service with my AmEx invisible card.
 There are no rental cars.
 The trains and buses are sold out.
 How far is it to the border? Maybe we can run! I don't know.
 When I asked the lady at the desk, she told me in kilometers! Look, Avery, you and I are cut from the same cloth.
 It's one of the reasons we work so well.
 And why we're unbeatable at a three-legged race.
 We ruined those kids' field day.
 But being similar has its drawbacks.
 It's a Double-edged sword.
 So could our shared patriotism and refusal to ever give up be, in this situation, a bad thing? What are you saying, Jack? Avery, maybe it isn't the end of the world if our daughter is Canadian.
 Alexander Hamilton was born in the West Indies, and he went on to To what, Jack? Be a mouthpiece for Federalism and then die in a duel against someone named Aaron? Is that what you want our daughter to be? A big government duel loser? No.
 Where did all those babies come from? Dear God, they've re-started the failed NBC shows.
 Oh, no.
 Please, no.
 Not "Gals on the Town" again! Love and friendship, having it all Or maybe just a great pair of shoes One of them has to be Asian Can they be good at their jobs? Those bathrooms are disgusting! Someone has to do something! Please, do something! You said you knew the captain! All right.
 You know what? This is wrong.
 I can see the terminal from my window where people are buying new magazines, and crossing their legs, and eating at a Chili's Express! We were like them once, and we can be again! But we're just airplane folk now! No.
 We still have our dignity.
 And maybe we can't go back to the terminal, but I know Captain Burnett.
 He's a reasonable person.
 He compromises readily on movie choices and sexual positions.
 If we as a group can decide what reasonable things we want, I'd be happy to talk to him.
 Okay, I can't turn the air on because I'd have to power the engines up.
 That wastes fuel.
 I'm assuming you don't want to stop for gas in the middle of the ocean.
 Okay.
 What about the bathrooms? Stewart did not study dance at Carnegie Mellon to become a flight attendant to clean bathrooms.
 Well, at least give us some food! Negative.
 Those potato chip bags are designed to be opened in flight.
 You open them at sea level, somebody could be killed.
 And can you tell me when we might be in the air, Captain? Sure.
 In about a half-an-hour.
 Okay, Carol.
 You have a decision to make.
 Are your passengers just cattle, or are some of them, maybe even just one of them, someone you care about? I think you need to make a decision.
 Am I just another authority figure that you're taking one of your stands against, like that police horse you yelled at? If I can't poop on the street, why should my tax dollars pay for someone else to? Or am I your boyfriend who you're going to let do his job? Really? If this is you doing your job, you're terrible at it.
 Think about what you're doing.
 You're making a choice here.
 I am not just a passenger.
 And the captain has turned on the "Fasten Seat Belt" sign.
 All passengers, including any lipless middle-aged women in lesbian clown shirts, should please be seated at this time.
 Oh, Mr.
 Jordan, several messages for you.
 "Breakfast with Charles Schumer"? I don't want to watch that guy eat.
 "5K Homeless Walk"? That just seems cruel.
 "Cornell Commencement Address"? Sorry, but Tracy Jordan doesn't do safety schools! The next level sucks.
 You gotta be careful.
 You ever hear of the "Peter Principle"? Yes.
 Just now.
 The reason people are unhappy in their careers is that they keep getting promoted until they're in over their heads.
 The Peter Principle says you rise to the level of your incompetence.
 But my incompetence knows no bounds.
 Stay in your comfort zone.
 If it was me, I'd just hide out until people forgot who I was.
 But keep in mind we Hornbergers are famous cowards.
 On D-Day, my grandfather wore a German uniform under his American one, just in case.
 There's a reason that men like that aren't chosen for greatness.
 I don't remember saying you could listen to that conversation, but continue.
 Imagine if Mr.
 Hornberger were in your shoes, and he turned his back on his community, on the world.
 How would he sleep at night? How would he look his children in the eye? Or perform his husband bedroom duties for instance, painting the bedroom? Think about the shame.
 He'd be run out of town! Al Sharpton would denounce him at a press conference on the street because Al Sharpton doesn't have an office.
 Exactly! I thought going to the next level would be amazing, Ken.
 Like guitar-playing-chimpanzee amazing, God bless and keep him.
 But now everybody expects me to do all of this stuff, and I don't want to let anybody down, but I'm scared.
 You don't know the meaning of the word "scared".
 And I know, because I've looked it up for you a dozen times! Oh, thank God.
 Hop in.
 No, no, don't go back there! You guys drive.
 What? You drive while we hide out in the back hang out in the back.
 Everything's normal.
 No smoking.
 Yeah, okay.
 Thanks, honey.
 Great.
 I'm Lorne.
 If you're a cop, you have to tell me.
 I'm just kidding.
 We're all on vacation.
 Is this a mobile meth lab? Yes, it is.
 Look, if you want to quit Quit? I've never quit anything in my life.
 I'm still in Girl Scouts.
 I have 9,000 badges.
 Hey, I'm still looking for a golf ball I shanked in 1987.
 I am not taking that penalty stroke! Good.
 We agree.
 Now, let's drive this bomb to Buffalo and get this little bitch out of me.
 We've been offered a gate.
 What? What are you doing back here? Come on, let's go! Oh, we'll go.
 We'll go back to the terminal.
 And the lounge with the reclining chairs and the turkey wraps.
 Turkey wraps! And we'll forget any of this ever happened.
 Like the fact that you insulted me in front of my entire crew, especially Stewart, who often makes up hurtful nicknames for me, like Mr.
 Bumpy Landing.
 Great.
 And I'll forget the fact that you treated us like animals.
 Oh, well, I've already forgotten that you said I was bad at my job when everything on 'TGS' has been so great recently.
 Austin Powers on "Crossfire", timely stuff.
 Uh-huh.
 And I'm not even going to ask what the hell that voice is that you use on the intercom! "Uh, folks, half an hour means forever.
" Can I tell you what I hate about you? You're so stubborn when you think you're right.
 Even when the answer is on the Trivial Pursuit card! The card was wrong! And you're no better, Carol! You built that bookshelf incorrectly! I did not! I wanted the books to slide off! Okay, listen, Liz.
 We will get through this if, for once, you can just let it go.
 I will take us back to the gate when you stand up in front of my crew and my passengers and admit that you were wrong.
 What? Admit that I, as Captain of this vessel, was in the right.
 You were wrong to question me, and I was correct in my treatment of you and your fellow animals.
 I'd rather die on this plane.
 That can be arranged.
 All right, you saw the back of the Winnie.
 You know we picked you up to get passed Border Patrol.
 So what are you guys carrying? I'm sorry? In her fake stomach.
 You smuggling unpasteurized cheese? Prescription drugs? Maple syrup from the sacred Tree of Souls in Winnipeg? No, she's pregnant.
 What? Those contractions she's been having are real? Because they sound very sitcomy.
 What is taking so long? You guys should be in a hospital, not driving to Buffalo in a snowstorm.
 Thank you for your input, Lorne, but Avery and I want our daughter to be born in America so she can one day become President and declare war on Germany, like back when we were awesome.
 You know, you remind me of my parents.
 I find that very hard to believe.
 They were both really intense.
 They wanted me to grow up to be Prime Minister.
 So as a kid, I had to win the spelling bee.
 They made me memorize all 700 words in the Canadian dictionary.
 And then I had to go to law school.
 You went to law school? For one day.
 I was just so tightly wound that I got kicked out for karate-chopping my roommate.
 I know, I'm a stereotype.
 "All guys from Quebec are good at karate.
" Oh, my God, where are my manners? Do you want to try meth? What are you doing? I'm quitting.
 I'm calling 911 and getting an ambulance to take us to the nearest hospital.
 Actually, you dial 272 here.
 I will not do that.
 Kenworth, I was thinking about what you said, and you're right.
 I'm Oscar-winner Tracy Jordan.
 And as scary as it is, I have a responsibility to fix the world, starting with the worst place ever! IKEA on a Saturday? Africa.
 I leave today.
 Good-bye.
 Begin moving my things into his dressing room.
 Well, folks, from the flight deck, it looks like it's going to be another half-hour, and then we'll be on our way.
 I have an announcement! Our pilot has gone insane! No, don't listen to her! Having seen "Crimson Tide" on Showtime last weekend, I believe the only course of action available to us is passenger mutiny! I am Denzel! I am invoking Sky Law.
 You are now silenced, shrieking harpy.
 Stop speaking! We could have gone back to a gate, and he wouldn't take us! Do not blame me! I wouldn't take us because she wouldn't admit to being wrong for challenging my authority! Why not? What's wrong with you? I am right, and he knows it! He could have given us food Maybe this is one of those times where both of you just say on the count of three, "I was wrong.
" One, two, three Never! How are you two dating? You're too similar! Where are you going? I'm pulling the emergency exit slide, and we are all getting off of this plane! I'll be a folk hero, like that guy everybody hates now! Don't you even think about it! That is a federal offense! Just try to stop me! Oh, you be careful what you wish for! I will waste you! You'll have to go through this old bastard first! Soren.
 Eglantine.
 Your journey is at an end.
 Sorry.
 I hope we can still be friends.
 Hello? Lemon, we had the baby.
 We? We? Shh, you need your rest.
 Oh, my God.
 Congratulations.
 Wait, aren't you in Canada? Yes, my daughter is Canadian-American.
 But I'm going to treat her just like a human baby.
 We tried to get back home, Lemon.
 In a meth lab.
 Avery and I fed each other's craziness.
 But one of us was brave enough to step back Just quit! He quit! Didn't they give you Percocet? That's what it takes.
 Somebody needs to be willing to quit.
 I hope you and Avery can make it because you have a whole lifetime ahead of you of that double-edged sword just swinging around, trying to cut your faces off.
 Thank you, Lemon.
 This was supposed to be a joyous occasion.
 I'm glad I called.
 I'm sorry.
 Your daughter is a very lucky girl.
 Carol and I br Jack.
 What? This woman's trying to tell me that we don't have to pay for any of this! Right, the Canadian health care system Oh, no, you don't! We will not be party to this socialist perversion.
 You will take our money! I'm sorry, sir, I can't do that.
 Oh, this is gonna be good.
 Avery, can you walk yet? I am right behind you, Jack! Let's go find a Canadian who will take our money.
 How is Africa, sir? It's amazing.
 This morning I taught the local schoolchildren all the words to "Monster Mash".
 So when do you think you'll be coming back? 'TGS' has a show in a couple weeks Don't you get that this is bigger than all that? Like how an ant is much bigger than a smaller bug? Well, that's an odd way to say that, sir.
 I have to go.
 This was a really good decision.
 Good-bye, K.
 Yeah.
 A really good decision.
 [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Listen up, everyone.
 I have an announcement to make.
 As you may have heard, Carol and I broke up last week Hang on, why do you have a cat? And a fanny pack? And your ponytail.
 It's being held up by a chip clip! Because I'm giving up, Jenna.
 I did the math.
 How many times does a woman meet Mr.
 Right? I've had three chances.
 Floyd, then Carol, and I was once on an elevator with Tom Brokaw.
 And I blew all three.
 Opportunities! So I am making my graceful transition into spinsterhood.
 I have adopted this cat, named her Emily Dickinson Named her Emily Dickinson! Lemon, a word.
 Hang on.
 Recent breakup.
 Fanny pack.
 Cat.
 Quick, who is the lead character on "NCIS"? Special Agent Jethro Gibbs.
 In your office now! What's the point, Jack? I'm done.
 I took the money I was saving for my honeymoon and I bought a cemetery plot.
 I also joined a book club at the senior center near my home.
 We' re reading Murder on the Orient Express.
 You know there's a movie of that, right? I did not.
 I want to help you, Lemon, but this is not the week.
 Avery's maternity leave was cut short so she could go cover the collapse of Greece's banking system.
 Since inventing democracy, those guys have been coasting.
 So you're alone with baby Liz? We're calling her Liddy.
 After Liddy Dole, G.
 Gordon Liddy, and my martial arts instructor Li Di.
 In addition, I have a huge presentation coming up.
 Meeting magazine is already calling it "the first great meeting of the decade.
" I have to be at my best.
 I'm negotiating NBC's licensing fees with KableTown.
 But aren't NBC and KableTown the same company now? That seems like a pretty big conflict of interest.
 Why would the government even allow that merger? It's okay.
 Don't worry.
 You just keep watching "Bridalplasty".
 Alysinna died last week! Oh, damn it.
 I didn't leave my baby nurse her check this morning.
 I have to go back home and pay her.
 Right now? It's complicated.
 These women run your household, so you have to keep them happy, which means not saying anything as your DVR fills up with Trinidadian soap operas.
 But as soon as I'm out of the woods, Lemon, I'll take care of this latest dysfunction.
 There's nothing to take care of, Jack.
 Watch this.
 I can fit Emily Dickinson's whole head in my mouth! No.
 Oh, hey, Pete.
 What's up? Well, nobody told the musical guest that Tracy is in Africa.
 So all their instruments got delivered even though there's no show.
 Rock stars, man.
 People screaming your name.
 Hot women throwing themselves at you.
 Living on a bus! I had all that once for three months back in the early '80s.
 Really? What band were you in? Everybody's working for the weekend What? Yep.
 I was in Loverboy.
 But then I had to choose between staying in the band or taking that college scholarship to study TV Budgeting.
 I made my choice.
 That part of my life is over.
 Hey, it's never too late.
 What did you just say? It's never too late It's never too late for now Yesterday's dreams are gone But today I'm singing this song 'Cause it's never too late It's never too late for now We need to start a band.
 I think we just did.
 I'm sorry you had to wait for this, Sherry.
 I hope there was enough shark meat in the refrigerator for one of your sandwiches.
 Hold on, this is the same amount I was paying you when you worked full-time.
 And now you're just working nights.
 It's my hourly rate.
 You understand my confusion.
 I'm actually paying you more money to be here half the time.
 I'm not saying that what you do isn't important.
 Avery and I appreciate you, and Liddy just adores you.
 But let's just say you were at the market, buying potatoes.
 And that 10-pound bag of potatoes costs $400.
 But then the grocery concierge tells you that a five-pound bag of potatoes costs $400.
 That would be shocking, right? Because a five-pound bag should only cost $200.
 What I'm saying is that we value what you do, but this rate is unreasonable.
 So, what you wanna do? I want to resolve this fairly and amicably.
 And I don't want any bad blood, so it was nice negotiating with you, and here is all your money.
 A repulsive murderer has been murdered.
 But in which of the two ways that I have suggested? In the simpler way, by the Mafioso disguised as a wagon-lit conductor? Or in the more complex way Liz, enough! I am not gonna just sit and watch you plummet into spinsterhood! Why are you talking so fast? Because I'm upset! Also, I've been taking these new Czechoslovakian organ-slimming pills.
 They contain a little bit of meth, which is something my body needs anyway! Listen, I'm not gonna let you wallow like this.
 I am taking you out so you can rebound.
 Sexually.
 What? No! Now, when I'm rebounding, I like to do it with an NBA player because it's fun wordplay, and they're mean.
 Well, thank you for that disgusting offer, but I will be in Editing all night, putting together "The Best of Tracy Jordan" to replace this week's show.
 So can't go out.
 Too bad.
 Well, I'm not giving up.
 I didn't give up when Eric Roberts abandoned me in the desert, and I won't now.
 No judgment, Liz, Mr.
 Roberts thought I was dead.
 It's never too late for now Two, three It's never too late There you are! Great.
 You just ruined a really boss take! We're recording a song called "It's Never Too Late For Now".
 It's about that delicious little mystery I call "life".
 Oh, my God, that sucks.
 Come on, we've gotta go to Editing.
 No, I'm not going to Editing.
 I'm in here shredding away like a righteous axe-master! And my arthritis is acting up.
 Do you have any lbuprofen? My fanny pack is in my office in my mini-fridge.
 I like my tampons to be cold.
 I'll be downstairs.
 Wait, "Hornberger-Rossitano"? Why is your name first? It's alphabetical.
 So what? So I'm the one who said, "It's never too late"! I invented that! When we get up at the Grammys, I talk! Not you! Welcome to Brokeblack Mountain.
 You need to go black! This is Loz Liz! This is Liz! Lemon, I am supposed to represent NBC in a negotiation that Rex Belcher of "The American Journal of Meetings" rated four chairs.
 Four! I'm sorry, is that another magazine about meetings? Meanwhile, I just got worked over by my Trinidadian night nurse.
 I made every mistake you can in a negotiation.
 I spoke first, I smiled, I negotiated with myself.
 If I had done that during a mock negotiation in business school, Professor Widmer would have spanked me in front of the whole class! Bare bottom! Okay, but it's harder with someone like a nanny, right? There's an emotional component.
 She takes care of your baby.
 Lemon, you just had a Structural Analytic Insight! Professor Widmer would have given you a "good job" spanking! What is business school? The reason Sherry can manipulate me is because she has leverage.
 Eight pounds of screaming, toothless, soft-skulled leverage.
 Liddy loves Sherry.
 And Sherry assumes that I love Liddy.
 But you do though, right? Yes.
 But Sherry can't prove that I love Liddy.
 So I renegotiate under new conditions.
 Specifically, that I hate my newborn daughter.
 Wow, Jack.
 I could never pretend to hate my beautiful baby daughter, Emily Dickinson the cat.
 Oh, boy.
 Uh-oh.
 I don't feel so good.
 I think maybe I have food poisoning.
 Really? Because I've never had a problem ordering from American Sub Restaurant Very Clean Come In.
 I'm sorry.
 Could you just leave your notes? I'll come in early tomorrow to finish.
 I guess that means you're free tonight after all.
 Where did you come from? It's a trick I developed to catch people talking about me behind my back.
 Did you know everyone thinks I'm insane? Now you have no excuse to stay in.
 Come on, no, Jenna.
 You know how much I hate clubs and dance halls and odeons.
 They're all malarkey! Okay, but what if I promised to find a place you like? And if I don't like it, I can leave? Yes, if you don't like it, you can leave.
 This isn't Eric Roberts' teepee.
 Sherry! Excellent.
 I've been thinking about our conversation earlier.
 It occurs to me that you are laboring under a fatal misapprehension.
 You think you have leverage over me, but you don't.
 I don't care about the baby.
 I've only known her for a few weeks and, and other than a fondness for Avery's breasts, Liddy and I have nothing in common.
 She is one of only two people ever to have thrown up on me, and I haven't spoken to Joe Namath since that Mardi Gras.
 What's more, I don't think Liddy looks like me, so, evolutionarily, that makes me want to eat her.
 In other words, either you take a pay cut or go and look for another job.
 Who has the leverage now, Sherry? Your move.
 Please stay! I'll send everyone in your family to college! So? Soft music, ample seating.
 And I know how much you like clearly marked fire exits! Don't worry.
 I'll find something to hate.
 Oh, okay, here we go, this sucks! This place is called "Canal Yards Project"? What does that even mean? I don't know.
 It used to be a factory or something Nope.
 Hipster nonsense.
 I'm out.
 No, you are not leaving because of the name.
 Excuse me, can I order two Diet Cranberry Beach Bangs, please? You got it.
 I'm going to need to see your I.
D.
, Miss.
 How about this for I.
 D? I participated in Hands Across America.
 Nerds! Where is it? Okay.
 My license is missing, which is my cue to go home.
 Excuse me, is this yours? Oh.
 Yeah.
 Thanks.
 I recognized your hair from across the room.
 What is that? Is that chestnut? Oh, the color is actually called "Grandfather's Shoe.
" Can I get you a drink? I'm having white wine with ice cubes and Sprite.
 That's my drink! I keep a thermos of it by my toilet! You misheard me! Okay.
 Excuse me.
 Can I get two more of these, please? So, did they make your droids wait outside, too? Seriously, why can't droids go into the cantina? I mean, Ponda Baba can try to shoot Luke? But a protocol droid is somehow a problem? Castles fall into the sand Could this really be God's plan? Or is it never too late? It's never too late for now Why can't I hear my vocals? I just mixed them down a little.
 I think it sounds better.
 Oh, really? Do you think that, or does she? This has nothing to do with Yuki.
 This is about making my song Your song? All right.
 You know what? Forget it.
 Sound Mound is finished.
 Which means I now have 5,000 t-shirts to unorder.
 Pete, like 20 of these just came in for you.
 Dammit! I'm having a really nice time with you, Liz.
 Me too, Anders.
 I like how you don't have one weird little tooth.
 Thank you.
 Look, I was gonna go back to my hotel room, get "Eat Pray Love" on Spectravision and make fun of it.
 Julia Roberts in a movie about eating? Give me Kirstie Alley.
 Somebody who knows what she's doing! Come on.
 Let's go.
 Oh, boy.
 That does sound fun, but I really shouldn't.
 Yeah, I came here with my friend, so I'm just gonna stay here.
 Get off of me! My eye! It's a fight! Typical nightclub malarkey! You okay? No, my heart's pounding like I'm watching Oprah's farewell season.
 I thought the stupid Universe was telling me to get a cat and be a spinster, and now I don't know! What's it trying to tell me with you? Liz, look, I don't believe in signs or messages from the Universe.
 You know what I do believe? It's never too late for now.
 It's never, it's never It's never, it's never It's never too late It's never too late for now Every day we give you a $100 for cab fare home? Do you realize what you're doing to me, Sherry? You're unraveling the very fabric of who I am.
 I negotiate for a living.
 And I never lose.
 And now I have to go negotiate with my colleagues at KableTown after having been reamed by a woman wearing Winnie the Pooh hospital pants.
 I don't have what you have, Sherry.
 A brand-new baby that they've poured time and money and love into.
 Some helpless, pathetic, useless thing that would die if left alone Oh, God, I do have that.
 I have NBC! Look, broadcast networks receiving licensing fees is unprecedented, Jack.
 But we're willing to offer NBC I mean, okay, not to negotiate against myself, but I get where you guys are coming from.
 Look, NBC is part of the KableTown family now.
 It's our baby, and we want it to thrive.
 But your offer is it's unreasonable! So, what you wanna do? Way to go, Liz! Attagirl! Walk of shame! You bow-legged bitch! I see you opened the Scotch NBC sent us that week we came in third.
 I'm guessing your meeting went well? Home run, Lemon.
 Speaking of baseball metaphors, I see that someone got to first base.
 Which is what I consider sex with a stranger.
 Okay, fine, I had a one-night stand.
 And it was not the worst.
 And maybe you're right.
 I shouldn't give up just yet.
 Still, I can't believe I did that.
 And I wouldn't have if everything hadn't gone so perfectly.
 I mean, what if I had been stuck in the edit room all night? Or if I hated the club and left? Or what if Anders, yeah, Anders, hadn't found my license? Don't overthink it, Lemon.
 Stranger things happen every day.
 I once saw an Internet video of a mouse and bird that are friends.
 Don't overthink it.
 Gasp! Last night a repulsive act occurred at a hotel in midtown.
 There are two explanations as to how this event came to be.
 A simple one and a complex one.
 The simple explanation is that I went to a discothèque and a handsome, interesting man fell for me.
 In the wake of my break-up, I allowed myself to have an experience that gave me reason to feel hopeful about the future again.
 Very simple.
 Great.
 I think we're done here.
 Please, Monsieur.
 There remains, of course, the complex explanation.
 A vast conspiracy involving multiple agents and precise, coordinated efforts.
 A conspiracy that begins with the timely "food poisoning" of Donna Straunk.
 And who here has access to Donna's food? The second peculiar event I "lose" my license, allowing it to be found by a handsome stranger.
 Serendipity? Perhaps.
 But how does one lose one's license out of a malfunction-proof Velcro Phillies sport wallet? Someone must have had access to my fanny pack.
 I only wanted lbuprofen! Then why is my lbuprofen bottle still sealed? And then there is the matter of the wine.
 Four glasses, and yet, I was wide awake.
 Was my uncharacteristic energy perhaps due to the giddiness of the evening? Or was someone slipping me black-market organ-slimming pills? Liz, I wouldn't.
 The conspiracy continues.
 What pushed me out of the club when I was wavering about leaving with Anders? Yeah, I came here with my friend, so I'm just gonna stay here.
 Get off me! My eye! What, this? I got hit by a bird on a roller coaster! Even the club was strange.
 Almost as if it had been designed specifically for me.
 But who has the resources and the connections to create a Liz Lemon-themed club in one day? You had to sign your crime, didn't you? You're the one who gave me those "Monk" DVDs! And what was the final straw? It was Anders saying, "It's never too late for now.
" A coincidence that I took as a "sign from the Universe.
" Also, it's just a great song that Pete wrote.
 Thanks, man.
 Sound Mound rocks the town.
 Shut up, both of you.
 So how did Anders even know that phrase? How did Anders seem to know everything about me? It's white wine, ice cubes and Sprite.
 She calls it "Funky Juice.
" I don't know if I want to do this.
 There's only one question I can't answer.
 Who was Anders? An old Harvard chum of Toofer's? The son of one of Jack's Senator friends? He certainly wasn't a Swiss prostitute that Martha Stewart recommended to me.
 And that is the complex explanation.
 Of course, such a conspiracy would require a group of people who knew me so well and cared about my happiness so much that it's impossible to believe.
 No one could ever be that lucky.
 Which is why I choose the simple explanation.
 I choose to believe that last night, Liz Lemon went out, got some, and felt good about it.
 And so I say good-bye to spinsterhood.
 Good-bye to giving up and to Oh, God, a hawk got her! Emily Dickinson! 'Cause she's a weekend lady She's got that weekend style Temperature's rising She's gonna make you smile Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday Uh-uh-uh Friday, Saturday, kind of Sunday and holiday Mondays Uh-huh-huh 'Cause she's a weekend woman Gonna make her mine Gonna make it the weekend all the time Weekend woman [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Wonderful news, non-famouses! My publicist just called from rehab.
 I made the Internet! You're on "JOANofSNARK.
com"? On what? JOANofSNARK.
 It's this really cool feminist website where women talk about how far we've come, and which celebrities have the worst beach bodies.
 Ruth Bader Ginsburg! "Comedy's Freshest Female Voice"! Take that, Courtney Thorne-Smith! That's not about you.
 That's about some stand-up named Abby Flynn.
 Wow.
 Lady! Pretty nostrils! How do I find me? Computer! "Jenna"! Well, here's your article.
 "Why does 'TGS' hate women?" What? How can they say that? We love women.
 With Tracy gone, our last episode was all Jenna.
 This is Amelia Earhart.
 I'm almost across the Pacific Oh, no! My period! I'll now take questions.
 Oh, no! My period! Let's nuke England! But that is an ironic reappropriation I don't know anymore.
 And this started as a show for women, starring women.
 At the very least, we should be elevating the way women are perceived in society.
 Oh, my period! You're all fired! Jack, do you think I hate women? Absolutely.
 But it's not your fault.
 You are genetically predisposed to compete against other women for the attention of strong, powerful men like myself or others very similar to me.
 For example, Hercules, the Highlander, or God.
 I want to roll my eyes right now, but the doctor said if I keep doing it my ocular muscles might spasm and eject my eyeballs.
 Female jealousy is an evolutionary fact, Lemon.
 If you try to breed it out of them, you end up with a lesbian with hip dysplasia.
 You're wrong.
 I support women.
 I'm like a human bra! Which is why I want to hire a young comic named Abby Flynn to come on as a guest writer.
 No, you are not budgeted She's got good energy.
 Hire her immediately.
 See? I'm not threatened by the fact that men are attracted to her.
 Please, Lemon.
 It's got nothing to do with her hot mouth.
 Every organization needs new blood once in a while.
 Like Hank Hooper says in his book, "New blood is the lifeblood of every company's blood.
" He's not a strong writer.
 Hank Hooper.
 Isn't that the guy who outbid no one for NBC? Yes, he's the CEO of KableTown.
 But he won't be forever.
 And some day, when he steps down, I intend to succeed him.
 Well, believe in yourself, and you'll reach your goals.
 I read that on a bottle of women's exercise water.
 It's not so simple.
 KableTown is a family-owned company.
 There is a potential successor, so to get what I want, I must find a way to destroy her.
 Her? It's a woman? Well, not exactly.
 Hi, I'm Kaylie Hooper, I'm 14 years old, and I'm waiting in line to meet Justin Bieber because he's I'm sorry, your new rival is a 9th-grade girl? How old is Hank's wife? Is it a second marriage? Why do men always marry someone younger? Because they can, Liz! Get a grip, Lemon! Kaylie is Hanks Hooper's granddaughter.
 Her parents' generation was lost to "Trust Fund Kids" disease.
 The aunt smokes pot and "paints," and her father is trying to sail an inflatable castle across the Atlantic.
 I have to ensure that Kaylie makes similar choices.
 So you're trying to destroy a 14-year-old? I am trying to guide a 14-year-old.
 Maybe I can help her realize some other life goal.
 To become a doctor's nurse, or a lawyer's mistress, or even the President of the United States Shopping Association.
 Wow.
 Typical.
 Meanwhile, I'm helping women achieve their potential, because "potential" is the difference between what you can't do and what can't you do! Did you get that off of a bottle of water? No, I sent it in but AquaFem did not choose it! Okay, word is this Abby Flynn thing is really happening.
 Girl coming! This is a big opportunity for us.
 She does not know how much we suck.
 But she'll find out soon enough.
 I mean, how long did it take the women here? I don't know, how long does it take to see something? I mean, light travels at 186,000 miles per second, so No, duh.
 Being ourselves doesn't work.
 So to have a chance with Abby, we're creating new identities.
 I'm going to pretend to be rich.
 And I'll be a dangerous bad boy.
 And I shall be British.
 'Cause chicks dig British guys.
 Sir lan MacKellen? That dude must be knee-deep in boob! And if you guys don't go along with this, Lutz will play X-Box Kinect with his shirt off again.
 Star jump! I found the chrysalis! Rich.
 Bad boy.
 British.
 Got it.
 Nice! All right! Now, you may have heard of J.
 Fred Muggs, the chimpanzee that was on the "Today" show in the '50s.
 But what most people don't know is that NBC is still a network.
 Speaking of television, is that a field you'd like to go into, Kaylie? Work with your grandfather? I agree.
 TV is boring.
 So do you have a favorite subject in school, Kaylie? You don't want to hear about school.
 It's dumb.
 Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Kaylie? School's cool.
 Just like Justin Bee-eye-bear.
 Well, I've never told anyone in my family this before, but my dream is to be a marine biologist.
 My favorite fish is the cleaner wrasse! And I even tried to get it chosen as our school mascot, but, well, I was outvoted, so our new mascot is a slut.
 So, you're interested in marine biology.
 Hmm, who do I know? You've probably never heard of the explorer Bob Ballard You know Dr.
 Ballard? He discovered the Titanic, the Lusitania, and, according to his website, a guilt-free cheesecake recipe! I'm also on the board of the American Museum of Natural History.
 If you like, I could have Dr.
 Ballard give us a private tour of the museum.
 Oh, my gosh, Mr.
 Donaghy! That'd be so cool! Okay.
 Now please follow me to Brian Williams' bathroom, which is also J.
 Fred Muggs' skull! Okay, guys, Abby's on her way up.
 West Ham drew nil-nil at Wolves?! Stop that! Are you guys changing your personalities for Abby? Is she here yet? You are married! Okay, this is exactly the kind of male douchebaggery that is about to take a real hit around here.
 Don't you know I'm talkin' 'bout a femolution? Tracy Chapman.
 She's a woman, right? It's a new era at 'TGS'.
 Let's see the blogosphere try to say I hate women now! Look at all these dudes! I knew I smelled sausage! Yes! Abby? I'm Liz.
 Liz! Thank you! Oh, our nips touched! Mine are so hard! Mine are different sizes.
 Abby, these are the writers.
 Oh, where's little Abby gonna sit? I guess I'll have to sit on somebody's lap.
 You can sit there.
 Eenie Please, God.
 Meenie Come to mommy.
 Minie Me, pick me.
 Moe.
 Give me strength, oh, Oprah.
 When I first started working here, an 8-year-old Shirley Temple taught me how to roll a cigarette.
 Lemon, who thinks gesturing with one's thumbs is for poor people and is going to be the next CEO of KableTown? This guy! Already? What'd you do to her? Nothing.
 She wants to be a marine biologist! Kaylie is playing right into my hands.
 I also had a youthful fascination with exploration, and I know exactly what any Practice frottage on a poster of Linda Ronstadt, and meet your idol.
 Like I met Jacques Cousteau.
 I will never forget what he said to me.
 Huh.
 I did forget.
 It was so long time ago.
 When I was a kid I got to meet the "Where's the Beef" lady! With my connections, I can make Kaylie's dreams come true.
 I should dig up my old shell collection and give it to her.
 Complete the seduction after Bob Ballard and I double team her! Word choice, Jack.
 Withdrawn.
 Lemon, is that the new woman you hired? Is it cold in here, or is it just that I'm not wearing underwear? She should be careful around the crew.
 New York gives us a tax break for employing sex offenders.
 It's a terrible program.
 What is that? Ow! That is Abby Flynn.
 She's a guest writer.
 She's being hot and doing baby talk.
 I invented that! Summer of '98 I took it to a whole new level! There can't be two of us, Liz.
 She must be destroyed.
 I don't know how I get here.
 No, Jenna, that is exactly the problem.
 Men infantilize women, and women tear each other down.
 Exactly.
 I'll start by spreading a destructive rumor about her.
 Like the famous one I made up about Jamie Lee Curtis.
 That she has two butts! Look, you and I actually want the same thing.
 But we're not going to destroy Abby, we're going to fix her Yes, like you fix a dog! We'll sterilize her! No! I'm going to show Abby that she doesn't need to act like this.
 Hi, I'm Jack.
 It's nice to meet you.
 Hi, I'm Abby.
 Hi.
 Whatever.
 So, what do you think, Kaylie? Oceanography's a pretty cool life.
 I can't believe I'm talking to Dr.
 Robert Ballard! You're not.
 "Bob" is short for "Bobert".
 Oh.
 Oh, my gosh! An anglerfish! "Lophius piscatorius.
" That was my favorite fish as a boy.
 Look at those teeth! You know, that's a female.
 The male is much smaller, and is basically a parasite that lives on her! Until mating, of course.
 Then the male dies.
 Yes, the scientific term for that is "marriage"! Don't tell Gina I said that! The ocean really is the final frontier, Kaylie.
 And we keep finding new things! Giant tube worms that breathe hydrogen sulfide.
 Arctic jellyfish.
 Oh, and a chemical in kelp that scientists think might one day cure ice cream headaches! There is so much left to discover! And you could be the one to do it! I kind of envy you.
 Youngsters are the future of ocean exploration, Kaylie.
 I mean, I'm not gonna live forever, no matter how much gold I give Poseidon.
 That's why I'm making you a student argonaut! I can't believe this is happening! You already speak dolphin.
 Excellent! Is there an age cutoff for the Student Argonauts? What if you gave me a sticker as a joke? You know, Mr.
 Donaghy, it seems like you really love this stuff.
 Maybe you should have been a deep sea explorer.
 Oh, no, Kaylie.
 That was just a boyhood fantasy.
 I'm an adult now.
 I don't have fantasies anymore.
 Kaylie, this way.
 There she is, men! The elusive northern right whale! Blow the wind westerly, let the wind blow Oh Derry, hi Derry, Hey Derry, ho Jack! Jack! Yes, sailor, what is it? We're moving on.
 Hey, Liz! Abby, thanks for meeting me here.
 This place is very special place to me.
 Is this where you got your V-card punched? What? No! Does this look like the makeup room of a clown academy? No.
 This is a statue, and I know you know this, of Eleanor Roosevelt, First Lady to the world, champion of the rights of women, and the lid on my high school lunch box.
 Look, I know it can be hard.
 Society puts a lot of pressure on us to act a certain way.
 But 'TGS' is a safe place.
 So you can drop the "sexy baby" act and lose the pigtails But I like my pigtails.
 My uncle says they're sexy Enough with the gross jokes! And that voice! I want you to talk in your real voice.
 This is my real voice.
 And all the "sexy baby" thing isn't an act.
 I'm a very sexy baby.
 I can't help it if men are attracted to me.
 Like that homeless guy.
 He likes what he sees.
 Okay, that could be for me.
 It's not.
 It's for her.
 Abby, I'm trying to help you.
 Really? By judging me on my appearance and the way I talk? And what's the difference between me using my sexuality and you using those glasses to look smart? I am smart.
 I placed out of freshman German! Or Lutz using that sexy English accent to get me in the sack.
 No, you didn't! Lutz? Is that even possible? I mean, I was there when he Belvedered! God, Abby, you can't be that desperate for male attention! You know what, Liz? I don't have to explain myself to you.
 My life is none of your business.
 Except it is because you represent my show and you represent my gender in this business.
 And you embarrass me.
 Kiss! Dude, I am sorry, but this is who I am.
 Deal with it.
 Now, are we gonna give the gentleman what he asked for or not? Kenneth, when I'm gone, how do you think people will remember me? Actually, sir, I've already started to compose a heroic ballad commemorating your life.
 Slaves of Jesus, hear my tale I'll tell you what they'll say.
 "Hey, remember Jack Donaghy? He sure wore a lot of suits and went to a lot of meetings.
 Now power down, conversation robot.
" Sounds like you're asking some pretty big questions.
 When I have problems, I like to talk to the man upstairs.
 Unfortunately, Mr.
 Guzelian got put in jail for attacking his father.
 I mean, what are we put on earth to do? Sit behind a desk? I'm still young, Kenneth.
 I could devote the time I have left to other interests.
 Let Kaylie run KableTown.
 I'll join Ballard's crew and become a scientist-adventurer! Now that would be a legacy! I hope my legacy is a "Sesame Street"-type TV show that promotes illiteracy in girls.
 This could be me.
 "Remember Jack Donaghy? He was the world's greatest oceanographer.
 And we walruses owe him everything for giving us the gift of language.
" No.
 All right.
 Your time is up, friend.
 I'm taking control of this Abby situation.
 No, Jenna, I'm not done.
 Check this out.
 I'm thinking to myself, "Whatever happened to the erasable pen? Besides pencils, who's saying that was a bad idea?" I've always thought that, but I never had the courage to say it.
 Is that Abby? I knew her boobs were fake! And that baby voice is fake, too! You know, as someone who speaks very na-tu-ra-lly, I'm offended.
 She's taken on a whole new identity.
 She changed her nose, her teeth.
 She even changed her name! It's not Abby Flynn, it's Abby Grossman.
 Well, that's understandable.
 I mean, "Grossman" is a little "bagel-y".
 Abby used to be a strong, smart, beautiful woman.
 Why did she turn herself into that baby hooker? Children's book idea.
 "Baby Hooker".
 Don't tell Liz.
 Well, I am confronting Abby with this in front of everybody.
 Oh, that's vicious! Forget my idea.
 Yours is so elegant.
 No, Jenna.
 For the last time, we're helping her.
 Say no more.
 Got you, boss.
 Who else is on the call? Katherine Scott, Sales.
 Andy Hoberman, Web Sales.
 Gil Coughlin, Oversight.
 I've got everyone from Meeting Planning.
 Tricia, Maria, Greg, Greg P.
, Lyle, Edwin.
 This is Charles.
 I'm on for Douglas.
 No, Charles Mr.
 Donaghy? What are you doing here? I could ask you the same thing, but that would make no sense! Where did you get this picture of Cousteau? That? The Internet.
 This picture exists in only two places.
 The negative is in my personal safe along with my will and some Beanie Babies that I thought would be worth more.
 Or it can be found in the right book.
 Hey, what are you doing? Quiet, chalk-hands! A real man is talking.
 Why do you have this, Kaylie? Why are you reading my autobiography? Well Same reason you were reading Pop-Pop's book.
 Researching the enemy.
 So it's true.
 I was trying to make you think you didn't want to run KableTown, while you were doing the same thing to me.
 What a super sleuth.
 You're just like Vanessa from the "Vampire Detective Mysteries".
 I'm not familiar with that reference, but I assume that Vanessa is some kind of cool genius.
 You don't even like the ocean, do you? I hate the ocean.
 It's for tools! The ocean's awesome and for winners! You are for tools! You can't beat me, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 You worked your way into this world, but I I was born into it.
 I breathe it.
 So watch your step, 'cause I can always tell Pop-Pop you gave me alcohol.
 And I can always seduce one of your teachers and get her to fail you.
 I'd be into that.
 Me too! Better pick up your books or you'll be late for class.
 This is my free period.
 Well played.
 Megan, books! You know what sucked about my last lesbian orgy? Right in the middle of it, one of us had to get up to go use the bathroom, and then we all had to go! Okay, there's something everyone here needs to see.
 Abby, you might want to sit down for this.
 Yeah, come sit on my struikgewas! On a chair! Come on, Sue.
 Abby, this is for your own good.
 Open apple, tough love time.
 Has anyone ever actually had a good time at brunch, you know? Is that you? I don't know where you found that, but I am taking it down.
 That's what she said! Okay, first of all, Steve Carrell owns that's what she said.
 He owns it.
 And second of all, it's time to stop hiding.
 A young person helped me online post this on JOANofSNARK.
 Com.
 You stupid meddling bitch! Yes! There's your real voice! There's Abby Grossman! To quote Eleanor Roosevelt, "We are all" Do you understand what you've done? You have signed my death warrant! How's that now? My ex-husband is gonna see this, he's gonna find out where I am, and he is gonna try to run me over with his car again! I changed my appearance to get away from him! Oh, 'cause I thought it was, like, pressure from society.
 You're right, Liz.
 I was "hiding".
 From a man who went insane after getting electrocuted while watching "Sleeping with the Enemy".
 I was cut out of that! And, yeah, Liz, I am "desperate for male attention.
" Because I feel safer having men around in case Troy comes back! That is why I slept with Lutz.
 And I shall protect here.
 Is there an "Abby Flynn" here? That's her, Troy! I'm on your side! Get her! Jeez, Lutz, it's the UPS guy.
 Okay.
 First of all, I think we all owe Abby an apology.
 Oh, my God, it's from him.
 "I thought this box would be the perfect size for your head.
 P.
S.
 I was electrocuted again while watching 'Seven'.
" Great.
 I have six hours to start a new life.
 I'll have to be a redhead this time.
 Oh, I don't know.
 With your coloring You know what? Don't listen to me.
 You must really hate women, Liz.
 Liz Lemon is a Judas to all womankind! Okay, we were on page six, where Wonder Woman gets her period.
 Tonight's tag's gonna be a nice wrap-up scene between Jack and Liz.
 After all, they spent the whole episode trying to help young women.
 But first, I would like to correct some of the science we saw tonight.
 There's no oil in kelp that helps cure ice-cream headaches.
 No, the only thing that will cure ice-cream headaches is having sex on a motorcycle.
 Kaylie was not speaking dolphin.
 When a dolphin expresses excitement, it sounds like this: Okay, we've had a lot of fun tonight, and it's not over.
 In the time remaining, we're gonna go now to that Jack-and-Liz wrap-up scene I promised you.
 Well, Lemon [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Previously on "Queen of Jordan" Don't tell me I can't sing! What the have you ever done? Who the are The Beatles? I know what you said about me! Please.
 I don't even think about you! You're nothing! I know the photo shoot for Randi's dog's funeral is the wrong place to tell you this, but I'm going to Africa.
 It's my way 'til payday.
 D'Fwan, glue in the business wig.
 I have an important meeting with Jack Donaghy from NBC today.
 D'Fwan forgot his catchphrase! Since Tracy is off helping people in Africa, I finally have a chance to focus on me.
 That is why I'm launching my music career.
 It has been my dream to be a singer ever since I was a little drunk the other day and rented out a recording space.
 Oh, Angie, thank you for coming in.
 NBC could not be happier about "Queen of Jordan.
" For the first time in six months, we beat all the Music Choice channels.
 Except, of course, Latin Beats.
 Well, Angie's thinking of the next move now.
 As you know, my single, "My Single is Dropping", is dropping.
 What's happening? My single is called "My Single is Dropping".
 And it's dropping.
 Angie, "My Single is Dropping" is the reason I wanted the three of us to meet.
 With Tracy gone, 'TGS' will be airing another "Best Of" special.
 Actually, Legal says we can't use the word "best.
" Either way, the studio is free.
 So I thought you would have your release party there.
 You would perform and Lemon here will help put it together.
 What? No! I thought we were here to talk about getting Tracy back from Africa.
 Look, I love Tracy, but he is work.
 Angie, look what the banister did to me! Do you know how much of my time he wastes? Let's roleplay! Tracy, we're gonna be late! Our boat exploded.
 With Tracy away, it's time to let Angie be the star.
 I hope Tracy doesn't come home for months.
 "Months"? No, we can't make it that long without Tracy.
 You can't do this! Are you giving me orders? Am I the waiter? Is this the restaurant that I'm opening up with Dennis Rodman and Webster? No, I just thought you would be on my side.
 "Yes we can!" Obama '08! Remember? Look, this is a very complicated As an Executive of KableTown and NBC Universal, I am ordering you not to use that footage.
 John Francis Donaghy.
 Verbal signature.
 Angie's single release party is tomorrow night.
 It seems like the perfect place for me to reveal my shocking secret past! No, we're not writing a tearful admission about you being a call girl in Delaware.
 Write it yourself.
 For your information, I am a Christian illiterate.
 So that's not an option.
 You know what? I'm not getting sucked in to your crazy reality show nonsense.
 Liz.
 I'm so mad at you for that thing you did! Am I trying to instigate fights by throwing wine at people just to get on camera? And maybe also promote my new lifestyle website, Jennas-Side.
 Com? Of course not.
 I mean, is wine throwing something that even gets you on a reality show? God, Jenna, I told you not to buy that domain name.
 Say it out loud.
 Jennas.
 Side, "genocide.
" I'm not hearing it, Liz.
 Hey, guess who's getting out of jail? I don't know, but I hope they didn't collect two hundred dollars.
 Lynn Onkman.
 Remember her? Oh, sure, that hot teacher from Queens who had an affair with her student.
 Oh, my God! Check out this picture.
 Frank, is that you? You never said you were in Lynn Onkman's class.
 Sure I did.
 What? Do you know the kid she had the affair with? No.
 Yes.
 I don't know.
 Shut up.
 It was you! I don't want to talk about it! Well done, sir! Guys, a teacher preying on a student is wrong Yeah.
 if the teacher is male and the student is female.
 What happened to Frank is awesome.
 Standing ovation! You don't understand! It was love! We were in love! I need to look good for my party.
 And I refuse to wear anything in my size or appropriate for my age.
 Lemon, a word.
 Ham! Wow! If only Tracy were here, he'd be like, "Damn, woman, I wanna make love to your neck!" Don't do impressions of other races.
 Roger that, Angie.
 I'm in charge of setting up for Angie's party.
 'Cause I'm not just a gay hairdresser.
 I'm also a homosexual party planner.
 Mr.
 D'Fwan, Party City does not sell "giant see-through clocks or strap-on Pegasus wings," so I got this paper pineapple instead.
 Hey, girlfriends! Why don't we all have some drinks and talk about how I think Portia has no class? You heard me, Portia! Uh-uh.
 I will not be in the same room as that woman.
 Is this about what happened in Atlantic City? I didn't say it.
 You did.
 I didn't say it.
 You did.
 I didn't say it! You did! I didn't say it.
 You did.
 Excuse me? Um, I'm looking for Francis Rossitano? Oh, snap! That's Lynn Onkman! Portia reads the papers.
 Mrs.
 Onkman? Frank R? Yeah.
 Michael.
 Are you back on meth? No.
 Why? You got some? Think fast! Nice catch, Dotcom.
 I am sick of being disrespected by that man.
 Sick of it! Yeah, I was an athlete.
 Very graceful.
 Sports stories? I've got some.
 Oh, I'm meeting my friend Greg for lunch.
 Again? When I was at Princeton, I played baseball and football.
 And back then, football players went both ways.
 Really? So, you "went both ways"? Yeah! We all did.
 It was the '70s.
 So when you played baseball, were you ever on the DL? Yeah.
 I was on the DL most of my junior year.
 DL can mean "disabled list," but it can also mean "down low," or "secretly gay.
" Which one was Jack talking about? When we were on the DL, we spent most of our time in the whirlpool, getting rubbed down.
 You were you a switch-hitter? Switch-hitter, pitcher, catcher.
 Whatever the boys needed! I think I've made my point.
 I drank all the throwing wine and I have something to say to Portia! I know what you said about me! Good.
 Because I'm concerned about you.
 Even though we just met, I can tell you're an alcoholic.
 Come on, Portia! I wanna fight! I have battled my own demons.
 And you need help.
 No! I don't need any help.
 I am in denial about my disease and I don't know what would change that! Drunk actor brainstorm! I'm going to make Pete host an intervention for me.
 It'll be all about Jenna.
 Drama, crying, the beauty of redemption, perhaps a song.
 This is the best day of my life! I'm sorry, you want me to perform in this? Yeah, you're Amy Grant from the "Baby Baby" video.
 The one where the man likes her at the carnival! That's some white nonsense.
 Too bad Tracy's not here to take your side.
 He'd be like, "Damn you, Liz Lemon!" We discussed this, Elizabeth.
 Yes.
 Anyway, I've got the auditions for your backup dancers.
 Good.
 'Cause I'm looking for dancers who can dance for 15 seconds, 'cause that's how long my song is.
 What? That's my wedding video.
 Oh, no! I must have mixed up the DVD discs.
 Ugh, well, we'll just have to watch it anyway and see what feelings arise.
 Angie, just start! Are you wearing handcuffs, Tracy? Hey, can my friend, Trines, come with us on our honeymoon? What? Okay, I should have watched that first.
 Do you see how exhausting that man can be? Yes, he has his flaws, but I know you two love each other.
 Yeah, and with him gone, our relationship has never been better.
 So, he can stay in Africa for as long as he wants.
 I'm on Angie time now.
 Frank and Lynn's story really moved me.
 So I let them have their reunion date at the strip aerobics studio I bought with the money I got after that cop shot me.
 What else did you miss in prison? Oh, they kept remaking "The Hulk" and it kept getting worse! Could we talk about something other than comic book movies? Sure.
 I thought about you a lot when I was away.
 And I still remember the moment when we fell in love.
 You were administering a scoliosis test to the class.
 And you lingered on my spine.
 Frank, why did you bring me here? And who is that woman? A friend.
 Continue.
 I'm sorry, but I couldn't bring you to my place.
 My mom's there and she still wants you to rot in hell.
 You live with your mother? Yeah, otherwise who would wake me up for work? What's wrong? Frank, the boy I fell in love with was the most amazing eighth grader that I've ever met.
 And I couldn't wait to meet the man that that boy became.
 But you haven't grown.
 You're still talking about superheroes and video games and why Seth Logan shouldn't have played the Green something Hornet! Yeah, and it's "Rogen.
" It's like you're stuck.
 Oh, I wonder why I'm stuck! What could have happened to me when I was 14 to make me never want to grow up? Inside voice, Frank.
 And I refuse to take the blame for that.
 I lost everything to be with you Well, this is who I am.
 If you don't like it, then what's the point? Now, may I be dismissed? Okay.
 I thought this was a meeting to discuss your spinoff where you do matchmaking for wealthy dogs.
 I lied.
 D'Fwan thinks that maybe you're not being true to your you.
 I know what it's like to live a lie.
 I used to be in the military.
 But I was unfairly thrown out because I went berserk around all those dudes and tried to bang everybody.
 It has come to my attention that some of what I said yesterday may have been misconstrued.
 "Going both ways" in football means playing offense and defense.
 And there was nothing gay about the Princeton fight song! Oh, the merry men of Princeton are charging up the rear holding all the balls Okay, I hear it now.
 Regardless, I am not gay.
 Or clumsy.
 So your little show has nothing with which to embarrass me.
 That was the chair! Here, I'll show you.
 It was the chair.
 What is this? Jenna, everyone here loves you very much.
 But because of your drinking, we feel like we're losing you.
 Is this an intervention? We all agree it's gone too far.
 Kenneth, Richard Esposito, your two psychics Wait, you're seeing another psychic? I mean, I knew that.
 No! I'm not doing this! I'm leaving! Read your letters.
 Jenna, everyone has written you letters that they'd like to share.
 "Ms.
 Maroney, your addiction has negatively affected me in the following ways.
 Number one: I was so worried I forgot to write the rest of this letter.
 Thank you.
" I mean Webster, we need to talk.
 Your check didn't clear.
 Excuse me, is that my computer? No, I was just, um No, pinwheel! Not now! Are you on my e-mail? Are you e-mailing my husband? I can explain.
 I'm asleep right now and think that that's my computer.
 Huh? What? Where am I? "Tracy, as your wife, I'm ordering you to come home.
" I know this looks bad "The kids need you and I want to give you all the sex things you like.
" You don't have to read anymore.
 "For instance doing it across the bed instead of up and down.
" I saw that in a movie.
 "Come home now.
 Sho 'nuff.
 Angie.
" "Sho 'nuff"? It's a first draft.
 Are you trying to trick Tracy into coming home? Were you trying to trick me with my wedding video? Listen.
 You're not in charge.
 I am.
 Mind your own business! Yeah, well Tracy is my busin Ow! Come on! There's more where this came from! I'm contractually obligated to pull out some bitch's weave eight more times this season! It's not a weave! God! It's the beauty of redemption! Jenna, will you accept the help we're offering you today? Of course! Today is the first day of the rest of the my life.
 Jenna, this is Charles.
 He has his van waiting outside.
 How nice.
 He's going to take you to the airport and then fly with you to the Alternatives Treatment Center in Minnesota.
 Well, of course.
 'Cause that's how interventions end.
 And I can't back out now, otherwise they can't use any of this! Oh God! Anyway, that's why I did it.
 One, to see the fear in her eyes.
 And two, without Tracy or Jenna, we can file a claim against the show's insurance and keep getting paid without working.
 So, this is kind of the best day of my life.
 After my second husband shot me the second time, I realized that love is the most important thing in the world.
 I just hope Frank does the right thing.
 Oh, Frank.
 How did you know where I worked? It's one of the benefits of being in love with a registered sex offender.
 Frank, about what happened at Randi's strippercise studio No.
 You were right.
 I have been afraid to grow up.
 Whoa, what are you doing? I'm throwing out my kid stuff.
 I want to become the man you waited for.
 The man you helped cheat on the Presidential Physical Fitness Test.
 Well, if you didn't get better at the shuttle run, they were going to put you in the hospital.
 Oh, no! That's your favorite, you can't! Skeletor's not my favorite.
 You are.
 Are you throwing toys in the fryer? You're fired, Onkman! Now give me a waiver to sign! The world has to be educated about Blurry Face Syndrome! Angie has changed her hairstyle since this last photo was taken, and D'Fwan is a queerfectionist.
 Wow.
 She gets a whole window? Wait, what used to be there? Oh, Angie! A Queen of Jordan indeed.
 Jack, I also suffer from irritable bowel syndrome.
 It was the chair.
 I hope you're not this clumsy on the dance floor! I am not clumsy.
 You know why you're so tense? Because you have a secret locked up inside you.
 A man-sex secret.
 You know what? I give up.
 If this idiotic show insists on portraying me as some clumsy gay flatulent, so be it.
 I am extremely secure in my athleticism, my masculinity, and my rectal integrity.
 Mm-hmm! "Mm-hmm" indeed, D'Fwan.
 I know who I am.
 So if you want to dance, it would be my pleasure.
 Yeah, he's straight.
 That boy cannot dance.
 I know what D'Fwan said about me and it is on! I'm a superb dancer! At Princeton, I played Maria in an all-male production of "West Side Story.
" Oh, forget it! You people should be ashamed of yourselves! Jenna, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be on a plane.
 I explained to Charles that I was just pretending to be an alcoholic to get on camera.
 And we laughed, and he said I can drink as much as I want.
 So, cheers! To good friends! You're insane! In the lobby, she pulled a wrench out of her purse and hit me over the head! I will never go to Minnesota! "My Single Is Dropping" is not just about a single dropping.
 It's about a woman learning to fly.
 A woman who doesn't need a man.
 Or anybody.
 Except Josh at Sidney Bernstein Management, Sidney at Josh Bernstein Accounting Shut up, Angie! Just shut up! I'm sick of your selfishness! People's jobs are at stake! I'm selfish? You are a joke! And everybody thinks so! Let me talk.
 I am talking! Will you let me talk? Can I talk for once? You need to call Tracy right now because I know that he is your man, but he is my man, too.
 And 'TGS' is my family and my family is thick as thieves! Now who here wants to teach me how to fight? Attention, everyone! I found a glove in the elevator.
 If anyone is missing a glove, I may have found your glove.
 Angie, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to make you cry.
 No, It's not you, Liz Lemon.
 It's them.
 I miss my weird love.
 But he won't come back.
 What? I've been trying to get Tracy to come back ever since he left, but he won't.
 So I sit and act like this is what I want.
 But what I really want is for everything to go back to the way it used to be.
 I just want to wake up in the morning and look over at my husband asleep on our neighbor's roof.
 But if you can't get him to come back, who can? What if he never comes back? What is going to happen to all of us? Wait, you know what? This is my glove.
 If anyone sees another glove, I've lost one of my gloves! Thank you! Next week on "Queen of Jordan" I challenge you to a dance contest! You'll never get me, Charles! Why are you mad at me? Because of what you said! I never said it! That was the chair because I only pass gas once a year for an hour atop a mountain in Switzerland.
 Oh, God! Oh, brother! [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Hey, Jack, the vending machine is broken! I know.
 I broke it.
 I needed to speak with you, and I knew that was the fastest way to get you up here.
 You bastard! I trusted you! Lemon.
 Lemon! Is there any news about Tracy? As of this morning, he was still saving lives in Africa.
 I'm doing God's work here in Africa.
 Why, just yesterday, I kicked two naked people out of a garden! But, Tracy, we need you here.
 Simba, Rafiki! Click, click, click! Yeah, that's right, I just put you in your place in African.
 "TGS with Tracy Jordan" without Tracy Jordan is an oxymoron, like "liberal government" or "female scientist.
" Or "Princeton football.
" We were four and three in Ivy League play last year! Our quarterback, Henry Chang It doesn't matter.
 The point is that, without Tracy, 'TGS' is going on a forced hiatus.
 Forced hiatus? Okay.
 So, what should I tell the troops? It's simple.
 Sit them down individually, tell them the network still supports the show and that this is temporary.
 But you're looking out for us, right? Pounding on desks and doing whatever this is called? Power wagging, and I'm doing what I can, but I spent a lot of political capital buying a new network for KableTown.
 Is it TNT? Are Rizzoli and Isles friends in real life? It's a small cable network targeted towards gay male viewers.
 It's called TWINKS.
 That's the name of your network? Isn't "twink" a term for a young, hairless gay man? Nonsense.
 TWINKS is an acronym designed to project a positive gay image.
 "TWINKS Television With Individuals Naive, Kinky, Shaved.
" Okay.
 If the network were thriving, it would be one thing, but my programming has yet to find its footing.
 Ugh, no.
 Next.
 Boring.
 Who? TWINKS could be extremely lucrative.
 Advertisers covet this demographic.
 When I was with D'Fwan on "Queen of Jordan," he spent $4,000 on chihuahua outfits for himself.
 Okay, well, don't worry about "TGS.
" I'll take care of this hiatus thing myself.
 Thank you, Lemon.
 I'd like to help, but "I'm Afraid My Hands Are Tied" is the only show anyone's watching on TWINKS.
 The important thing is, this "forced hiatus" is only temporary.
 We'll be back before you know it.
 Sidney, it's Frank.
 'TGS' is dead.
 Start booking me stand-up gigs.
 How many black women's colleges are there in the country? What are you doing? You just said we're going on a forced hiatus.
 I know what that means time for Plan B.
 Harriet Tubman School of Nursing? Yes and yes! Good thing I kept my teaching certificate so I can still sub.
 Last time I taught, I was like Robin Williams in "Dead Poets Society," by which I mean I got fired.
 No, Pete, this is only temporary.
 Thanks for telling me, Liz.
 We'll get through this.
 Thank you.
 Finally, someone with some faith.
 No, I meant my JennaBabies and I will get through this.
 I've been selling these on Q VC for years.
 It's my Plan B.
 This is Asian JennaBaby.
 Excuse me, G.
I.
, do you miss your girlfriend? I'm good at math.
 So it's not offensive.
 Where are you going? It's just until Tracy comes back! I'm going back to the job I had in Holland police psychic.
 A Dutch TV show is based on me.
 Come on, Sue! You can't just leave me here with Toofer! Actually, I'm off, Liz.
 With my degree, I can always go into architecture or medical nanotechnology Wait, what did you major in? I'm sorry, I don't understand.
 Oh.
 I see.
 At Harvard, we call them "concentrations" You're my last hope.
 Please tell me you know this is temporary.
 Of course it is! 'Cause I'm gonna find a way to save the show.
 Let me just take out my idea journal.
 Hmm.
 This just says "Bird Internet.
" He said "forced hiatus"? Oh, man.
 That's bad.
 Simon, you're my agent.
 You're not supposed to panic.
 You're supposed to help me.
 Like how Fredward helps iCarly.
 No! Listen, everyone here has a Plan B.
 If there's a real chance that 'TGS' could go away, what is my backup? Maybe something with vampires.
 'Cause everything has vampires nowadays.
 Have you seen the "Twilight" movies or "Vampire Diaries"? I'm not allowed to.
 You need to get me some meetings.
 Would you be willing to come in for an Alpo commercial? If you can get through the audition without pooping, it's yours.
 I'm a human writer, Simon.
 Find me a writing job! So, Jack, how's the baby? Baby? Ah, yes, BAB Y Black-Asian Bisexual Youths.
 Those are viewers we want, and TWINKS is gonna bring them in.
 It's not a business question, Jack.
 I mean your baby.
 Your daughter.
 Oh, of course.
 Liddy.
 She is adorable.
 My night nurse swears she calls me "koskel," which, in Trinidadian Creole, means "stranger.
" Don't let work be everything, Jack.
 Family's just as important as fixing that "fellas that like fellas" network you talked me into buying.
 I'm on top of that.
 Are you? Jack, there's lots of things I like fishing, marches by John Philip Sousa, telephones that look like footballs.
 But there's one thing I don't like losing money! Now, I don't know if my tone is conveying the fury I feel about this, but I am, pardon my French bonjour.
 Now, that's a joke, but I am really, really mad! Look, Hank, I'm already working on fixing TWINKS.
 I'm remaking "Knight Rider" with the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.
 It's okay, Jack.
 You made a bad decision and bought something you didn't understand, like when I bought tickets for "Black Swan.
" Remember when a movie was just a fella with a hat running away from a fella with no hair? No.
 The point is you failed.
 But, unless there's a gay Jack Donaghy locked up somewhere who understands all this stuff, let's just chalk this one up to never again and enjoy our lunch.
 Hank there is a gay Jack Donaghy.
 His name is Devon Banks.
 Are you okay? I sense something, a presence I've not felt since Lemon.
 I've decided to hire Devon Banks.
 Banks? But he's your nemesis.
 That would be like me hiring that mouse that keeps pooping in my slippers! Devon is the perfect man to fix TWINKS.
 He's a gay shark, like the actor who played Jaws.
 But he's gonna come in and try to ruin everything, and everything is already ruining itself! Not this time.
 Banks put all of his eggs in the Obama basket.
 When the administration started to falter because of our conspiracy I mean, Obama's ineptitude, he tried to distance himself publicly from your President.
 The recession we're emerging from was primarily caused by a lack of responsibility and accountability.
 Then he tried to rejoin us capitalists.
 Showed up at John Paulson's Sweet Sixteen Billion party.
 Nobody would talk to him, not even Ira.
 And he was all, "Oh, I'll just look at these books," then pretended to get a text and left.
 And we were all like, "Whatever.
 We'll go to IHOP and not tell him!" Where is he now? I tracked him down to an address in Brooklyn.
 He's on Linkedln, Lemon.
 He might as well be dead! So I throw him a lifeline if he comes crawling back like a crab, I guess.
 What else crawls, Lemon? Babies, Jack.
 You have one.
 Hank Hooper is a traditionalist.
 He had his first heart attack when he saw pineapple on a pizza.
 He'll hate Banks and his hairless nostrils.
 A man should have nose hairs.
 Hooper will hate Devon, and he'll never be able to go over your head.
 Exactly.
 I'll pay him for his ideas and kick him out the door.
 Speaking of TV ideas, would you buy a show about a girl television writer trying to have it all in the city and also she's a vampire, I guess? I like the end part.
 Lemon, why do you have a blank notepad with "Plan B" written on it? Because I'm freaking out! I told everyone about the forced hiatus Wait, you said "forced hiatus"? Yeah, I didn't know it was code for "cancelled.
" I thought we understood each other! I thought we understood that you are never to think that I understand anything! And you have no Plan B? I've been telling you to prepare for the end of 'TGS' for the last two years! Well, there have been a lot of "Amazing Races" on since then, and I had to watch them and go online and comment on them! Here are your options.
 You can go to L.
A.
 I've been to L.
A.
 Once.
 Olive just turns into Barham? Justice for Rodney King! How do I get to 10? It's the 10! Rodney King! You can't afford to be selective.
 Opportunities for writers are fewer and farther between.
 What about opportunities for storytellers? Beginning with the cave paintings of Lascaux, mankind I can get you a meeting with Nick Lachey for "The Sing-Off.
" I'll take it! You here for the "Sing-Off" gig? Yeah.
 Do I know you? You know my work.
 Walk with me.
 I'm Aaron Sorkin.
 "The West Wing," "A Few Good Men," "The Social Network.
" "Studio 60.
" Shut up.
 Do you know Nick Lachey? I hear he doesn't even let you sit in the meeting.
 He just screams at you to see how you react.
 Wait, you're not really applying for this job, are you? Of course I am.
 You've got to take work where you can find it, especially now.
 Our craft is dying while people are playing Angry Birds and poking each other on Facebook! What is poking anyway? Why won't anybody do it to me? I'm cool! So it's really that bad out there.
 I mean, you're Aaron Sorkin.
 Speaking of Angry Birds, do you know how to beat 11-4? It's just a red guy and a green guy.
 The key is do not use the green guy as a boomerang.
 Did we just go in a circle? Listen, lady a gender I write extremely well if the story calls for it this is serious.
 We make horse buggies, and the first Model T just rolled into town.
 We're dinosaurs.
 We don't need two metaphors.
 That's bad writing, not that it matters.
 Mr.
 Sorkin? Mr.
 Lachey will see you now.
 Mr.
 Lachey, huge fan, huge fan! I've have all your albums! Oh, you'll be proud of me, Miss Lemon.
 It is not easy coming up with ideas to save the show, but this morning, I held up this sign in the "Today Show" window! Now I'm just waiting for the phone to ring! Kenneth, you may not be able to save the show.
 If you want to save this dumb show, you got to get the fans involved.
 You know, like, sometimes people mail stuff to networks to show how passionate they are.
 They sent light bulbs to save "Friday Night Lights," hot sauce to save "Roswell," and douche bags to save "Entourage.
" Okay.
 So we just need to think of something that fans can send Hank Hooper that says "TGS," something like Bird Internet! It's about time, Cashmere.
 Did you find Chana's Boppy? Was it at Music Adventures? Banks.
 What's become of you? Nothing! These aren't babies.
 They're organ farms! Don't look at me! Devon, explain the gaybies.
 I'm a househusband now.
 Happy? I married a shiny black dancer named Cashmere.
 We mixed our sperm together so no one would know whose baby is whose.
 Now, have you had your fun looking at the freak? I'm here to offer an olive branch.
 I'm working with KableTown now, and we've acquired a network called TWINKS.
 I could use someone on it full time, a subordinate.
 You came all the way out here, to Brooklyn, to offer me, Banks, a job? You must be desperate, Jack.
 TWINKS must be exploding, and not in a good way.
 You thought that I would lick your boots, but you need me.
 So now I'm gonna make you let me lick your boots! I'll keep you on a very tight leash.
 Fantastic.
 Continue.
 I will not gay set you up again, so I'll be very clear.
 You will be under me, and if there's one slipup, your ass is mine! You couldn't resist coming to see how far I'd fallen.
 But that was your mistake.
 Down came the rain and washed the spider out! No! You are the spider.
 I am the sun! I dry up all the rain! Yes! Freeing me, the spider, to climb up the spout again! You bastard! Now, who wants some num-nums? Hey, Simon, what's up? Any word from "The Sing-Off"? It's a pass.
 But Lachey hated you.
 So what now? You're fired.
 What? You're fired.
 Are you dropping me as a client? What am I gonna do? Jack can't help me, you don't want me as a client.
 I have no other skills! Liz, I'm gonna tell you what I tell my dog clients when I drop them.
 Simon Jack, we've been waiting almost an hour for this Banks fella.
 The only explanation I can think of is that he keeps stopping to perform good deeds.
 No.
 He's pulling a power play, right out of the gate.
 He's making us wait so it looks like I have no authority over him.
 Well I'm a straight shooter, Jack, except at the urinal.
 But that's just a little shrapnel side effect from Vietnam.
 So when it comes to business, I don't like these kinds of games.
 Boy, I hope my tone is conveying how annoyed I am! You should be annoyed, Hank.
 Of course Devon's crude attempts at manipulation don't work with a man like you.
 Banks is not a straight shooter like you and me.
 For now, we need him, but as soon as he stops being useful We throw him in a ditch! My apologies, gentlemen! I tried to call, but somebody spilled milky all over Daddy's phony.
 Didn't you, little Mykonos? You brought a baby to a business meeting! I'm so sorry, but this little guy's really sick.
 He threw up all over my jacket, and I just couldn't leave him, but of course, I didn't want to miss this fabulous opportunity.
 I'm always just trying to balance work and family.
 It's kind of what I'm all about.
 Well, son, you're gonna do great here at KableTown! Damn it! You know, one of my grandchildren is just about the same age as Mike here.
 We should set up a playdate! How's tomorrow? Hank, could Devon and I just have a moment, please? Of course! I'll just entertain this little bundle of joy with one of my Uncle Hank stories.
 The VC was everywhere.
 Yes, they were! Yes, they were! This is a new low, even for you, Banks.
 Using your own baby to get in with Hooper? I brought the sexiest one, too.
 His cheekbones are like granite.
 And Old Hank, the family man, fell right into my trap.
 This isn't even baby vomit on my jacket! It's mine! All mine! This is not over.
 Oh, look how much he just loves his Uncle Hank! "Whoosh!" went the flamethrower.
 "Medic! Medic!" cried the little boy! Oh, how was substitute teaching, sir? Just like "Lean on Me," in that a guy who looks like Morgan Freeman swung a bat at me.
 What are you doing with those sugar cubes? Starting a fan mailing campaign to save the show! People will send sugar cubes to Hank Hooper to show that they're sweet on 'TGS'! I've already sent about 100 of these, even though licking an envelope is a sin unless you're married to it.
 So I had to marry each envelope and then divorce it, which brings me to my ninth point So, you're putting a sugar cube in an envelope and then mailing it to Hank Hooper? But then when he opens it, it will have been crushed into a fine white powder.
 I suppose so, sir.
 Kenneth, do you know what anthrax looks like? I'm not with him! God bless America! My thorax! We never could have found him so quickly without your help.
 Thank you, Mentaalist.
 It is a gift and a curse.
 In the TV show, you bang me in a tulip field under credits.
 Mommy, what's that? It's a toilet or a woman.
 It's whatever you need it to be.
 No! People of the sidewalk, we can't give up on the written word! We need stories.
 Because I don't have a Plan B! I have a degree in Theater Tech with a minor in Movement! Why did my parents let me do that? It's over.
 Who's there? Show yourselves! You're one of us now.
 Who are you? Better to ask who we used to be.
 People whose professions are no longer a thing.
 Once, I was called Travel Agent.
 I was an American Auto Worker.
 And I played dynamite saxophone solos in rock-'n'-roll songs.
 Come.
 We live under the subways with the CEO of Friendster.
 No! 'TGS' isn't dead yet! Morning, Jack! Oh, my.
 Empty coffee pot, same cheap $300 tie as yesterday, nose hair all askew.
 You've been here all night trying to figure out how to fight back, haven't you? How was your playdate with the Hoopers? Oh, it was amazing.
 Yes, really superlative tummy time.
 Oh, I almost forgot.
 Hank Uncle Hank wants to expand overseas, and he's chosen me to be the face of the company in Europe.
 That's right, I've been promoted.
 But Europe is my purview! I was supposed to go there next week.
 I was going to take a picture where it looked like I was holding up the Leaning Tower of Pisa! Now I'll be taking that picture! Do you have any idea how strong I'll look? I vanquished you in one day.
 I was trapped in a world of wet wipes and rectal thermometers.
 Then the babies came, and life changed.
 But you set me free, Jack! Now it's weekends in New York, then jetsetting around the world in Economy Plus.
 I'll be thousands of miles away from the chaos in Brooklyn.
 Do you know what it's like to have triplets? It's just everything times three! Three pairs of grubby little hands smearing food all over your brand-new chihuahua outfits.
 Three pairs of feet in their weird, soft, little shoes.
 Three pairs of eyes, brown, like my husband's.
 Three perfect little mouths that smile every time I walk through the door.
 Three tummies that just want their num-nums and zerberts.
 Oh, God, I just love my gaybies too much! I can't leave! That's it? You're just going to talk yourself out of it? I'm sorry, Jack.
 But I had stuff planned! I was going to "Trading Places" you! Hey, I was bailed out of prison and told to come up here? That was weak, Banks.
 I don't expect you to understand.
 You don't know what it's like to have kids.
 Actually, Devon, I do.
 I have a baby daughter Liddy.
 And yet you still managed to be here all night trying to figure out how to bring me down? Damn, Jack.
 You are strong.
 You're like Dora's friend.
 Benny the Bull.
 Benny the Bull.
 Thank you.
 Jonathan, call my car.
 Okay, here's an idea.
 We keep 'TGS' going as a magazine.
 Miss Lemon, it's over.
 I applied to transfer to News.
 I'm sorry.
 I couldn't save the show.
 Here, I'm actually not that hungry.
 That's funny.
 This is the same place Mr.
 Jordan gets pizza from in Africa.
 I'm sorry, what? Oh, when Mr.
 Jordan and I talk on the computer, sometimes he's eating this exact same pizza.
 Africa's great! We got juju monsters gum-gum trees, and horsicorns, which is a unicorn with a horse's head.
 Kenneth, you beautiful goon! He's not in Africa! He's somewhere in the delivery zone of Federici's Pizza! We can find him and bring him back here and no more forced hiatus! I did it! I saved the show! I won't have to go work at News.
 And I won't have to be the world's worst hooker! You want to party? It's $500 for kissing, $10,000 for snuggling, end of list.
 No! I'm hungry again! Have you made friends in Africa? Oh, sure.
 Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Paul Simon, "Invictus.
" So, what's the weather like? Crazy.
 It's the snowiest winter we had in years in New York in Africa.
 Well, sir, I had a very interesting morning Uh-oh, it's nighttime.
 Got to go to bed or I'll anger the gods.
 They must be crazy! Africa! I probably should have realized he was in New York sooner.
 Bird internet.
 [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			We need to talk.
 Right now.
 We know Tracy's not in Africa.
 He's hiding somewhere in New York.
 What? Don't play stupid, Walter.
 We have ways of making people talk.
 By giving them fresh apple slices.
 Listen to me very carefully.
 This show is my life.
 I need Tracy back.
 Where is he? You think we don't want him back? Do you know how much our COBRA payments are? And he's the only one that knows the combination to the candy safe.
 The worst part is being able to see the candy! All right.
 But if I find out you're holding out on me, I will no longer allow you to use my office for your History Club.
 That's ironic, because next week's topic is fascism.
 What about Grizz and Dotcom? They don't know anything.
 Neither does anyone else Tracy's close to: His wife, Charles Barkley, Edward James Almost who is an Edward James Olmos look-alike that Tracy is friends with Kenneth talks to Tracy on Skype, doesn't he? Just call him.
 It doesn't work that way.
 Tracy only contacts Kenneth on special occasions, like Bastille Day.
 I'm going to go ahead and assume that Bastille is a stripper.
 As well you should.
 Now, there's a chance he may call tomorrow, because it's his lizard's birthday.
 Has it really been a year since we were all at the Waldorf eating that cake made out of lizard meal? Yep.
 Jeremy's almost 11.
 For now, our only lead is the pizza box that we saw Tracy eating from.
 We traced the phone number to a pizzeria in Queens.
 Listen to me, I sound like Cagney and Lacey, but without the slutty clothes.
 But you have to find him, Lemon.
 Your show works with Tracy.
 And this morning I figured out how to fix NBC.
 We will only do shows that work.
 That's nonsense.
 Do you know what the business model is in the entertainment industry? Make ten shows and hope that one of them works.
 We produce more failed pilots than the French Air Force.
 $15 million, so far, developing a show called "Who Nose?" About an investigative reporter who can't smell and has to get the story using only his eyes, ears and other senses.
 You underestimated me, Congressman, because I can't smell.
 But you made one mistake: You let me see the documents.
 So from now on, no more throwing good money after bad, only what works.
 Not on my watch.
 Your father may be gone, but before he died he programmed me to take his place No! Shut it down! This is terrible.
 So what's going on? Is Tracy coming back, or what? Well, I don't know.
 Well, what do you know? What do you even do? I'm the producer of the show.
 Right.
 That's what your wife told me in the shower this morning.
 All right, well, we're all having fun, and it's important that we all be able to laugh together.
 We're not laughing with you, we're laughing at you, you bald bitch! Yes, Reggie, I am bald.
 I lost my hair at a very early age when I hit that gypsy's kid with my car, but I am still your boss Hey, bald bitch! That's you! Yeah, I get it! He's being you! Yeah, I get it, I get it.
 Listen up, fives, a ten is speaking.
 As you may have heard, the JennaBabies dolls that I've been selling on Q VC have been recalled.
 Apparently, they were just being used to smuggle cocaine into the country from Mexico, and that's caused some problems.
 Let's just go to soccer practice now! I mean right now! Yes! It's 4:00 in the morning! Let's do it! We own this town! JennaBabies were my backup if 'TGS' gets cancelled.
 But don't worry, because I have a backup to my backup.
 We don't ever worry about you.
 We don't think about you.
 That's right, Frank.
 I booked a movie.
 It's called "Take My Hand.
" It's kind of an artsy character study about a young woman who has a lot of holes drilled into her head by a deranged veterinarian named Slaughterface.
 Oh, so you're doing a torture porn thing, like "Saw"? Exactly.
 In fact, the producers of this movie rented "Saw" and watched it.
 So, let me know if Tracy comes back.
 Until then, I will be in Stamford, Connecticut.
 We're shooting there for tax reasons.
 On an unrelated matter, does anyone know where I can get intimate bleaching done in Stamford, Connecticut? Anyone? I'm leaving to do a movie, Pete.
 What? No, you can't do that! That's what your wife told me in the shower this morning.
 Can we order lunch from IKEA? What? No.
 I'm the producer, I'm picking lunch today.
 Okay, we'll have a contest of strength to decide who gets to pick lunch.
 Who's next? Welcome to Federicci's What can I get for you guys? Well, as hard as it is to believe, given our apparent ages, this is my son.
 Seems about right.
 Okay.
 Good.
 My son is currently studying at a local pizza academy Really? Which one? New York Pizza Academy.
 Well, then I hate you! 'Cause I'm a Pizza Academy of New York man! So, what fraternity are you pledging? I'm not.
 There are no fraternities at New York Pizza Academy.
 That's right.
 You correctly answered my trick question.
 Now I am bound by Pizza Academy tradition to grant you any request.
 Wow.
 This could not have gone any better.
 We need to see all your delivery receipts from the last 2 months.
 Oh, you got that delivery-receipt exam coming up, huh? What a bear! Here you go.
 Take your time.
 I'll be in the back trying to think of other ways to help you.
 Well, this is obviously a dead end.
 Yeah! Eat your weakness! Congratulations.
 According to the transitive property, you just defeated Muammar Qaddafi in arm wrestling.
 Yes! This would have bothered me in my 20s.
 Pete, how are you so good at that? I don't know.
 I never work out.
 Help, Paula, here comes the big girl! She's got a clarinet! Pete, lunch is your pick! Takeout from Hooters! What? That makes no sense! We'll know they touched it! No one's coming to save you.
 Oh, God! Who are you? Cut! I just got a text from the studio.
 We're shutting down production.
 What? But I turned down "Carousel" at the Goodspeed for this.
 I'm sorry, Dana, but our budget depends on getting a tax break from Connecticut, and they say we're not portraying the state in a positive light.
 How are we not doing that, Shawn? I'm a little baffled over here.
 Yeah, no, it's just that we're spending taxpayer money saying there's a veterinarian running around Connecticut trying to make a house out of breasts for the Governor to live in.
 But there's a positive message at the end of it.
 "If you're a woman in Connecticut, Slaughterface will kill you.
" This must be it.
 Yes, Ma'am.
 There have been several deliveries to this address of Mr.
 Jordan's signature order: "Large cheese pizza with one slice taken out so I can pretend I'm eating Pac-Man, like my hero Blinky the ghost.
" I hear someone coming.
 Well, well, well.
 You found me after I ordered Thai food and gave you this address.
 Yeah? I'm sorry.
 I thought my friend was living here.
 And my best friend.
 Oh, is this awkward, because I'm your best friend but you're not my best friend? No, no one living here.
 At least not since we moved in Wait a minute, was that stuff here when you moved in? A copy of "Black Yachts" magazine and a Rubik's Cube that's been smashed out of anger.
 Mr.
 Jordan was here! So what, Kenneth? These guys have been here for 2 weeks.
 Tracy could be anywhere.
 We'll never gonna find him.
 'TGS' is going to get cancelled, and then what? Can I work here? I'll do anything.
 I'll get in my bra, and you can throw nails at me! I'll dance for you.
 Miss Lemon, don't panic.
 We have other options.
 For instance Mr.
 Jordan, where are you? Come back! For the love of God, come back or we'll die! Jack, can we talk, one ten to another? I'm an eleven, but continue.
 Me, my ass double, and a drill that once appeared on "Home Improvement" are currently starring in a feature film called "Take My Hand.
" Really? Years ago, Universal had a project by that name.
 It was a romantic comedy with Reese Witherspoon and Patrick Dempsey.
 No.
 Reese Witherspoon is just a likeable version of me.
 Then she dropped out, and it was rewritten as a buddy comedy with Dempsey and Josh Hartnet, but everyone fell asleep during the table read, so we moved it over to Telemundo, where they tried to turn it into a variety show hosted by a supermodel and a soccer ball with a moustache.
 I met that soccer ball once at a no-hands-allowed sex party.
 Then after another round of rewrites, it was picked up by our low-budget thriller/ high-budget porno division, SplatterFlix, and now it's a horror movie starring "any blonde actress.
" Thank you.
 Wait, that's our project? This is exactly what I was talking to Lemon about.
 Three years, millions on rewrites, $20,000 in first-class flights for the drill, and we still have nothing to show for it.
 And we never will.
 We just got shut down because Connecticut's being a douchebag.
 They won't give us a tax break unless the movie promotes tourism.
 Then, we make the movie pro-Connecticut.
 We are not losing any more money on "Take My Hand.
" Okay, we just need to hire some of those ugly people who have the paper and change the shapes on it.
 Writers? No.
 We'll do the work ourselves.
 Meet me in my dressing room.
 I'll get a computer from one of the ugly people.
 And I'll bring the world's greatest encyclopedia, my mind.
 Hey, is that a to-do list? 'Cause if your wife's on there, I already taken care of her.
 I challenge you to the wrestling of arms! What? Arm wrestling.
 On the stage.
 Midnight.
 In front of everyone.
 How about tomorrow? It seems like it'd be more convenient for people.
 I'll meet you anytime, anywhere.
 I just have to work around a PTA meeting at 5:00 that I can't miss 'cause this week I'm snack dad.
 Lemon, you look terrible, and I once watched you eat oysters while you had a cold.
 We had him, Jack, and we lost him.
 So Kenneth and I had to spend the rest of the afternoon trying to think like Tracy.
 I ended up eating a swordfish dinner at a strip club and Kenneth grabbed a cop's gun and shot a blimp.
 Well, tomorrow's another day, so go home, have a glass of wine, and watch a show about wedding-cake disasters.
 I can't go home, Jack.
 'TGS' goes away if I don't find Tracy.
 I'm going to wait up and hope that he calls his lizard.
 Did you make sure that Tracy wasn't pretending to be his own wax figure at Madame Tussaud's? Yes.
 There was some confusion, and I ended up punching the real Le Var Burton.
 I'm gonna go get Jeremy.
 I hope he's not still in heat.
 He has gotten my top off before.
 Here you go.
 Did you know that Connecticut is home to the oldest public library in the United States? Huh.
 Could you use that to motivate Slaughterface sewing the sheriff's mouth to his own anus? Of course.
 Elegant.
 Should "Vaginatorium" be capitalized? Oh, I cannot wait to humiliate that guy in front of all his meathead buddies.
 You're like a new man, Pete.
 Yeah I am.
 Last night I had sex with Paula, and neither of us was wearing a Walkman.
 Oh, yeah! Why are you picking him up now? I'm supposed to have him until the weekend.
 Shane wanted to come home, 'cause his dad's a loser.
 Did your show get cancelled yet? We don't know, Stephanie.
 We're waiting for Tracy to Skype with Liz and Jeremy the lizard.
 You're a joke.
 David's taking us all to Outback Steakhouse.
 And we're getting appetizers, 'cause David can afford them.
 Well, of course he can, Mr.
 Big Shot Pet Photographer! I hope you get sleep at night.
 I never thought I'd feel sorry for a guy with a tattoo of a leprechaun vomiting on a book.
 No one's coming to save you.
 Because we're deep inside one of Connecticut's 30! Please, don't kill me.
 I still haven't tried the famous seafood pizza at Sally's in New Haven! And cut! Great! All right.
 Let's move on to the scene where Slaughterface centipedes Jenna to the docent of the Danbury Railway Museum.
 Hold on! I just spoke to Wal-Mart.
 They sponsor wholesome TV programming, and I've convinced them to get into the movie business.
 They will partially fund this project if we make it family-friendly.
 I can never find stuff to watch with my kids.
 Thank you, Wal-Mart! This production will be profitable.
 Jenna, to your dressing room, to write.
 It begins with the words! Reggie, I need to show you something.
 Whoa! Is that your deltoid? I'm gonna beat you, Reggie.
 But I don't want to.
 I saw you in the lobby with Stephanie and Shane talking about David and appetizers.
 Look, I know what it's like for your kids think you're a loser, which is why I'm gonna throw the match.
 Wow.
 You would do that for me? You know what your wife told me in the shower this morning? You're a good guy.
 Oh, Miss Lemon, wake up.
 It's him.
 Oh, okay.
 This is it, Parcell.
 We got to keep Tracy on the line.
 So draw him out.
 Don't spook him.
 Act normal.
 'Ello! I'm a baby! What are you doing? I don't know! You got in my head! Hang on, something's not right.
 Why is Jeremy acting so weird? I don't like this.
 Hey, Tracy, don't hang up.
 Uh-oh.
 Jeremy, call me when you're alone.
 I'm sorry, Miss Lemon.
 Don't be.
 I know where he is.
 Merry Christmas! I practice abstinence! Connecticut! And cut! We're not done yet.
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is Phil Rosenthal, the creator of the acclaimed show Everybody Loves Raymond.
 The last great sitcom, still does a 3-4 share in syndication.
 I did okay.
 I have a refrigerator that's just for soda, so Anyway, Phil is interested in getting into acting I got the bug.
 and he has offered to pay us $5 million to be in the movie.
 I'll re-write the part myself.
 You know what? Why don't we just get one as written, and then we'll play with it.
 You are a guest here, Phil.
 Hello, Phil.
 I never heard back about my audition for Everybody Loves Raymond.
 I'd wondered if you'd made a decision.
 Yeah, 15 years ago.
 We went with Doris Roberts.
 But thank you for tying your headshot around a brick and throwing it through my window.
 Go ahead, Bald Bitch, go ahead.
 Thanks for doing this.
 I convinced my ex to drop off my kid so he can see me be a winner.
 You rock.
 No one's gonna know that you did this.
 Or that you're actually stronger than me.
 It doesn't matter.
 All that matters is I'm doing the right thing.
 That's real strength.
 Ha! I beat you! We're getting lunch from IKEA! IKEA! IKEA! IKEA! IKEA! IKEA! That's fine.
 Don't offer your guest anything.
 Wax statue! Darn it! I thought we had him! Are you kidding me? You have been hiding in my apartment for the last 2 weeks? What are you mad about? I'm waiving the $60,000 you owe me in appearance fees.
 Did you really think I wouldn't recognize my college futon with its trademark absence of sex stains? This is the stupidest idea you've ever had.
 Really? Think about it.
 'TGS' is your whole life.
 So where's the last place you would be if you you're out trying to save your show? Home.
 Life lesson from an unlikely source! The only thing I do here is sleep.
 I know.
 I've seen you do it.
 You're having a dream.
 Is this your only mustard? Huh? Wha? Yeah You're the one who wrote "every kind of mustard" on my shopping list! And yet you still don't have the one I'm thinking of! It's red, it says "ketchup" on it Uhp, I hear it.
 That's on me.
 Look Tracy, I don't know why you're going crazy, but I want to help.
 Just come back to 'TGS' You don't think I want to, L.
 L? Then why are you hiding? Oh, no.
 Did you also spill ice cream on your mom's boyfriend's record player? As a time saver, I will refer to the two of you as "Klemon.
" I wanted that next level, Klemon.
 Now, remember, to save time, you two are "Klemon.
" It's a combination of Just keep going! I had everything I dreamed of, awards, respect, Justin Long's autograph.
 But I also got expectations.
 People thought I could change the world, and it's too much pressure.
 Like the time I got stuck in Temple Grandin's hugging machine at the Golden Globes party.
 You pretended to be in Africa so that no one would be disappointed in you.
 I'm sorry I did this to you, Half of Klemon.
 I had no choice.
 Sean Penn wanted me to go to Haiti with him, and I'm not strong enough for the pain and the human misery of a 3-hour plane ride with Sean Penn.
 I'm tired of hiding.
 I just want my old life back.
 Then, you need to make people to stop respecting you and start remembering what an idiot you are.
 You're off the leash, Tracy.
 It is not a leash.
 It's a very long skin tag.
 You want your old life back? You're Tracy Jordan.
 Hulk Hogan called you a dirtbag.
 The NAACP once hired someone to kill you.
 You wore a penis hat to Princess Diana's funeral! Because I had worn it to their wedding.
 It was special to the three of us! You were the worst, and you can be again.
 You just have to go out there and remind people who you really are.
 Go trash a hotel room.
 Expose yourself to Elmo.
 Visit O.
J.
 In jail again.
 Attack the Lincoln Memorial with a hammer.
 I have to burn all my goodwill.
 Then they won't expect anything from me.
 And you can go back to your old life and "TGS.
" Tracy Jordan is off the leash! Godspeed, Mr.
 Jordan.
 I'm the hero cop and I'm here to say don't do drugs is what I'm here to say! I can't believe that amazing rap is available now on iTunes! Are you kidding? No one's gonna pay to see that.
 It doesn't matter.
 It's already profitable.
 It works, Lemon.
 To vote for Phil Rosenthal, text Phil to 62288.
 Vote? For what? Isn't this supposed to be a movie? Again, it doesn't matter.
 People will just do it, and we get 99 cents a text.
 Well I'm not letting Rosenthal win.
 I am voting for the Muppet.
 To vote for Liz Lemon, text Liz to 62288.
 [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			This better be important, Jack.
 I was in the middle of bidding on a bag of bras on eBay.
 Lemon, Hank Hooper is on his way up from Philadelphia, and he wants to meet with both of us.
 Why does he want to meet me? Do you think it's a good thing? It's not, Hon.
 I saw that in a movie once, but in the movie, the guy was dead.
 Nice tie, Jack.
 How long have you been there? I was sitting in that chair a minute ago.
 Nope.
 That was me.
 What can I say.
 I smell like leather.
 And you must be Elizabeth Lemon.
 Well, I'll be Bake McBrided.
 I know a Philly gal when I hug one.
 Now, Elizabeth, I like to look someone in the eye and smile when I say that what you're doing is bad.
 It's just horrible.
 Without Tracy, your show is like my cholesterol.
 The numbers are killing me.
 So I'm going to cancel 'TGS'.
 Hank, as you know, tonight is "TGS's" 100th episode.
 And we've been getting some good media buzz.
 We got on Wikipedia this week.
 So you did 99 shows against all odds and reason.
 That's something.
 Now it's time to rest.
 Really? You want to cancel the only show on your network starring a 42-year-old woman, a show that is number 1 in its time slot among men I thought this company was a family, but I guess it's that Austrian family and I am the girl in the basement and you are the dad who has been brutally Thank you, Lemon.
 What Liz is neglecting to tell you is that Tracy Jordan is back.
 Oh, well, that's something.
 And I would consider it a personal favor if you would let them do the 100th episode and then reevaluate the show with Tracy in it.
 All right.
 You get one more shot.
 Just like the Army doctor said to me after my weekend in Okinawa! You know, Jack, I'm amazed at how much you will stick your neck out for your people.
 It's no wonder you're here with us good folks at KableTown instead of running GE.
 They're mean.
 Jack Welch once smacked a pretzel out of my hand at the Super Bowl.
 Is Tracy back? I'd hate to think I just lied to Hank.
 Jeez, I'll get it done.
 You know I'll do whatever it takes, Lemon style.
 Everybody dance now! But you're going to get me another sandwich, or I'm going to cut your face up so bad, you'll have a chin.
 I will waste you! You'll have to go through this old bastard first! And I don't really think it's fair for me to be on a jury because I'm a hologram.
 What is the hold-up with Tracy? I thought you found him.
 I did find him, but he's still crazy.
 He thinks he can't be funny anymore because now he's a big Oscar winner, people respect him too much.
 He told me he feels like a Bartram's Scrub-Hairstreak trying to crawl back into its silky cocoon which is a butterfly metaphor, by the way, and not, as I first thought, a list of African-American hair products.
 Well, you just need to turn the beautiful butterfly back into a drunk, incompetent caterpillar.
 And I have a plan.
 I booked him on every morning show in New York.
 Tracy will destroy all his good will in time for rehearsal.
 I've been prepping him all week.
 So, Tracy Jordan, my wife, Joy, and I were at Mar-A-Lago Jesus was black! Just get him back in time for the show.
 I have a very full plate.
 Really? Is it from that pie place? And I'm tired of going to bat for you and your show.
 Oh.
 Okay.
 Fine.
 But just to be clear There is no pie.
 Okay.
 Who wears a swimsuit to Denny's? That's her! That's me! That's Pam! The overly confident morbidly obese woman.
 I can't sit in a booth! And cut! Congratulations, everyone.
 In 100 shows, we've done "Pam" 107 times.
 Can you believe it's been 5 years since we first started doing this? That wasn't me.
 There used to be another guy.
 I don't think so.
 Happy 100th show, Ms.
 Maroney.
 Danny and I were just talking about what an amazing 5 years we've had.
 I will choke you to death with your boyfriend's wig! Give me back my man, bitch! Can you reminisce about something that's happened since I've been here, 'cause I couldn't see any of that.
 I'll never forget what you said to me after that first show, Ms.
 Maroney.
 Terrific show, Ma'am.
 If I know anything about television, The Girlie Show is a hit! Oh, please.
 If this turkey goes I said that? I was so young.
 Wait, I saw that.
 How? Am I dead? Well, it's been 100 episodes, I better lay you across my grandmother's lap in the mating shed.
 But seriously, imagine if Jenna really was a mother.
 It would be horrible! The only things I want latched to my fun bags are celebrity DJs.
 I don't know, Ms.
 Maroney, I think you'd make a wonderful parent.
 You could sing the baby to sleep, and tell it fairy tales and act out all the witch parts.
 You're serious? Oh, you albino goon! I wish.
 Albinos get to be watchers in the mating shed.
 I can't even imagine you pregnant.
 A picture of you in U S Weekly next to Natalie Portman in the same maternity outfit, "Who wore it best?" I did.
 I wore it best.
 A baby gets you attention.
 Okay, listen up, friends.
 It's pep-talk time.
 I'm not going to sugar coat anything here.
 If we don't get Tracy back and do the best show that we've ever done, we're cancelled.
 So, we're counting on Tracy? Forget it! Frank, but that bigger hat back on.
 Look, we've been through bad times before.
 Riding straight to hell! Here come the roofies.
 Where's my mac and cheese? And we've had some good times.
 Who wants my puddings! And I know what you are all capable of.
 This is your moment.
 Tonight, 'TGS' will not be the worst thing on television.
 It'll be John Stossel! Who's with me? Yeah! Let's do it! Gas leak, huh? Great.
 Damn it! Why now, on my last day before retirement? Here, let me show you guys something.
 That's my girl.
 We're getting married when I get out of here.
 Why am I showing you guys this? It's going to jinx everything.
 Plus, you're a couple of pervs.
 We should be all right as long as the leak doesn't get into Ah, damn it, look at this.
 It's going right into the 6th-floor air duct.
 Damn it again! Well, we're going to have to evacuate the 6th until this thing's taken care of.
 Who's up there? 'TGS'? Isn't that show already half-dead? Who wants to kiss? Let's say we get some fresh air.
 Jack, we have a problem.
 There's a gas leak in the studio.
 Do you know what I find fascinating? Mystery novels written by janitors? How everyone who comes through my doors seems to want to talk about 'TGS' as if it's also the only thing in my life.
 Now, I may not be the head of GE, but that doesn't mean I'm not a very busy man.
 I've got other things going on too, you know? See? I got a new hair.
 It's white and it hurts, but How bad is this leak? It's pretty bad, prolonged exposure could lead to incapacitation or even death.
 Other possible side-effects include hallucinations, revelation of secrets, telling of truths, flashbacks, headaches, nostalgia.
 Can you believe this is happening to me on my last day of work? My last day.
 I don't know if there was a party planned Evacuate the 6th floor.
 I don't care if anyone dies.
 I refuse to have long, gas-induced conversations with any of you people.
 Boy, you know, over the past 5 years, we've had a lot of crazy characters and guest stars drop by 'TGS' Thank you.
 Pete.
 Thank you, Pete.
 I can't believe it's been 100 shows.
 More like 100 little strokes.
 You know The Girlie Show was working just fine, and then Jack came along and forced me to hire Tracy, and now look at us.
 Oh, life was so much simpler back then.
 I had a boyfriend, Denis.
 I mean, sure, he was an idiot, but he made great chili, and he didn't care if I watched TV during sex.
 Yeah, maybe I was better off then.
 Liz, we have to evacuate the floor.
 There's a gas leak.
 What? What about the show? Everyone, evacuate immediately.
 This is not a drill.
 The gas is not affecting me yet, so I can lead you to safety.
 Just follow these troll penises! Oh, God, what have I done? He is an Oscar winner for his role as D'Jeffrey "Lucky" Seeda in the movie Hard to Watch.
 Please welcome Tracy Jordan.
 Tracy! Tracy.
 Tracy? Why don't you shut your mouth, back that ass up, and make me a sandwich! He's awesome! You are still in character as the verbally abusive D'Jeffrey.
 I mean, he's become such a part of him.
 So, Tracy Jordan.
 You asked to come on our show because you had a revelation about your post-Oscar trip to Africa.
 I lied to all you ugly white ladies.
 I didn't go to Africa.
 I was hiding in a warehouse in Queens watching vintage pornography.
 I love your honesty.
 It's because you didn't feel like your authentic self that you walked away from success.
 That's actually very brave, don't you think? No, it's un-brave! You should hate me! I can't.
 You fly free.
 I'm a bird in a cage.
 Hey, you got to say around.
 We've got our no-cook cooking hair make-unders.
 What does that even mean? It's new hair cuts, but you can make salads with them.
 A true artist that feels things we don't.
 This is Today on NBC.
 No, we can't do another "Pam", not tonight.
 Frank, what is this? "Broken eyboard alk show"? I write what I know.
 Also, I broke my keyboard.
 No, we're throwing everything out and starting over.
 Only home runs, guys.
 Focus up.
 It's just hard to concentrate.
 It's so nice working outside.
 Tracy, how did it go? Are you on your way back? It was a disaster! What happened? What about our plan? I'm so beloved, I could do no wrong.
 Now, everyone's after me.
 UNICEF, the Gates Foundation, and what is Farmaid? Is it a drink? Is it a drug? Is it a bandage you put on a barn? See that's the kind of lazy standup I'll never do again! Tracy, just come back.
 Do the show tonight, and we'll figure all this out.
 "F" you, L.
L.
 Spells "full"! Because you're full of B.
S.
, Liz Lemon! Listen to me, there's still time.
 The media won't let you embarrass yourself, be like Michael McDonald and take it to the streets.
 Get the public to hate you, and the media will follow.
 And then you'll get your old life back, trust me.
 You better be right, Liz Lemon, 'cause I can't take much more of this.
 I think Bono got in my limo.
 Liz, do you think I'd be a good mother? No! And I wasn't even drinking anything.
 I just feel like I'm at a point in my life where I'm starting to have this real desire to nurture my career.
 I think pregnancy would be a great PR move.
 Oh, my God, you want a baby to help your career? Look, 'TGS' may be going away.
 Being pregnant is a great excuse for why I stopped working, instead of the truth.
 I'm in my 40s, very difficult, and not that good at playing "la realitee.
" Jenna, think about this.
 You will have a child Who will grow up to be a little gay fancy man.
 Well, good luck finding a man willing to ride that crazy train.
 I'll have you know, I talked with a man this morning who thinks I'd be a wonderful mother.
 He must be an idiot.
 He is an idiot.
 What about a sketch about how the Empire State Building is controlling us with electricity.
 Come on.
 Get out of here.
 Just maybe one more turn.
 Then I can go home to my sweetheart.
 I told her boy I'd hit a home run for him tomorrow night.
 Here we go.
 Damn it! I'm getting to old for this "shh" sound that comes from this gas pipe.
 Who are you? You're so handsome.
 I'm Jack Donaghy, CEO of General Electric.
 The question is, who are you? I'm Jack Donaghy.
 You were Jack Donaghy.
 You were magnificent.
 I'm still magnificent.
 No.
 I come from an alternate universe in which I followed our plan for world domination.
 I run the General.
 I own an NFL team.
 I guest starred on Entourage.
 What do you do? I'll tell you what I don't do.
 Wear a striped tie with a striped shirt.
 It's called "power clashing," and I do it because I can.
 I wore this on the January cover of Meetings magazine.
 We made the cover during Meetings History Month? I made the cover.
 What happened to you, Jack? You were supposed to spend 6 months in TV as part of your climb up the GE ladder.
 You've been here 5 years.
 And here isn't even GE anymore.
 It's Kable Clown.
 Town, Donaghy, and that's not funny.
 It was funny when I said it on my syndicated radio show.
 You bastard.
 I'm doing fine! You used to be a shark.
 I still am.
 Look at my claws! Sharks don't have claws.
 You don't even know what a shark is anymore! Oh, God! And do you know why? No.
 Liz Lemon.
 Lemon? She became your focus, at the expense of your own ambition.
 You should have realized within a week that Lemon was a black hole unworthy of our mentorship.
 And now it's 5 years later, and what are you doing? Are you building factories in Bangalore? Are you dining in the Palin White House? No.
 No! You're approving 'TGS' wrapped gifts, baseball caps with stupid sayings from the show written on them.
 What the hell is a Pwomp? It's when two fat people I don't care! What's happened to you? To us? We make me sick! Mr.
 Donaghy, What? Yes, Tom? The gas leak has spread to this floor.
 You got to clear out before you start seeing things.
 Thank you, Tom.
 I'll clear you out! Oh, okay.
 The real Jack Donaghy could handle a little gas leak! I am a Jedi! Hey, look, Tracy Jordan is ironically re-appropriating his bad past behavior as a commentary on Fitzgerald's dictum that there are no second acts in American life.
 I want to take a picture of him with my old-fashioned camera.
 No, no! Help, I can't swim! Damn it! He just pulled me out of the water and said, "Don't tell anyone I did this.
" I didn't even get a chance to congratulate him on his Oscar.
 Modesty and heroism.
 Two words forever synonymous with Tracy Jordan.
 "Tracy Jordan saves drowning man"? Oh, come on! Why is Tracy off rescuing people? Why isn't he here? He will be.
 I promise.
 And we need to be ready.
 Lutz, what are you working on? Breathing through my mouth so I don't smell the throw-up on my shirt.
 I would take my shirt off, but I visited my rescue chimp for his birthday last week, and another chimp got mad and bit my nipple off.
 He played with it, and then he kissed it, and then he ate it.
 Damn it, Lutz, focus up! Where's my computer? Cerie, did you not bring my computer down? You said you were writing.
 I've only seen you use that computer to look at pictures of Nate Perkins.
 Ah, pwomp! Hey, Jack, you're friends with Jeter and Springsteen right? Can you call and see if they'll be in the cold open? They'd have to kiss Oh, really, Lemon? You're still needing my help? and I'm still supposed to hold your hand, your wet, yet somehow flaky hand? What just happened? You happened! Sideways Jack was right.
 Sideways what? In here! Did you also have to evacuate the NBC store? No.
 It's just empty.
 This TV nonsense was supposed to be my stepping stone and instead it's my gravestone.
 And do you know whose fault that is? Sort of feel like you're going to say Leno? You.
 I got so sucked into trying to repair you, that I became the American auto industry failing to recognize that you can't fix a lemon! Wow, yeah, because the last 5 years have been so great for me with you as my mentor.
 I was better off before we met.
 So what's your point, Lemon? You'd rather be doing The Girlie Show and going home to Denis? I didn't say that.
 But at least Denis was always there for me.
 He's the only guy I can say that about.
 I dragged you down? Opposite! I should have gone with my gut and fired you when we first met.
 What? Flashback, please.
 Uh, Pete, hang back.
 Yeah, you bet.
 We have a problem.
 I can explain.
 My zipper broke.
 I don't think Liz Lemon's female voice is a good match for Tracy Jordan.
 Firing Lemon will send a message to the whole staff.
 No, no, you can't fire Liz.
 This show is her life! She hasn't got much going on.
 She threw a birthday party for her TV.
 If you fire Liz, then I quit.
 You'll never succeed by sticking your neck out for someone like her.
 But if that's how you feel, so be it.
 The important thing is that I fire someone.
 Pete.
 You tried to fire me? And then a week later you're like, "Oh, I want to mentor you.
 Unlikely friendship.
" Who do you think you are? I'll tell you who I was, that guy that fired Pete.
 And he could have run GE, but instead he got Lemoned! I should have fired you from my life! I knew you were supposed to push, but I didn't say anything.
 Mmm! The MSG is delicious today.
 I'm so glad that you're able to meet me at my break.
 Is this just to talk, or will you be activating my electric underwear? Just to talk.
 Paul, do you think I'd be a good mother? Of course not! And I'd be a terrible father.
 I mean, what if we had a child that was prettier than us? We'd have to leave it in a desert.
 But Kenneth thinks I'd make a good mother.
 Oh.
 Is that something you'd want? It wasn't something I'd thought about until Kenneth said I'd be good at it.
 And of course it'd be great for my career.
 Everyone would talk about my crazy name choice.
 Right now it's between "Frisbee-face," and "Glok-Gender-lrrelevant.
" I love you, Jenna Maroney.
 I want to hog-tie you and hide you in the luggage compartment of a Greyhound bus with just a bowl of dirty water.
 I love you too.
 But I don't know.
 I mean, Kenneth Parcell may be the only man in the world who thinks you should have a child.
 Break's over, Paul.
 Crew meeting in Lady Chantarel's office.
 He's pissed.
 Hey, Dummy! Gah, what? Whoa.
 You look good.
 You lose weight or something? Your neck, it looks looser.
 What are you doing here, Denis? I got your message.
 What message? Denis, it's Dummy.
 I miss you, come see me.
 Things were better 5 years ago, Jack.
 I was in my 30s and everything! Waaaz aaap! You've reached Denis's voice mail.
 How you doing? Get out of here, Joey! I'm recording my voice mail message.
 Is that real? Okay, I did call you, but I was not in my right mind.
 I mean, how could I be to call you after everything you've done? Good evening, sir, I'm Chris Hansen with Dateline NB C.
 Can I ask you what you're doing here tonight? Oh, yeah, I heard about some chick named Mary.
 Hey, threesome? How 'bout it, huh? It's Tania, right? It's wonderful service.
 Could you maybe not hit on the waitress in front of Joy screw.
 Run, Dummy.
 Oh, damn it! Denis! I checked a coat! But you called me, Liz.
 Oh, whatever.
 'Cause down deep, you still got all kinds of queer feelings for me.
 That's why I knew some day you'd be all vulnerable from a gas leak or a coma or a super period.
 You're disgusting.
 And I would be there for you.
 No.
 You know what I feel? You were a mistake.
 That I made at a time in my life when I could afford to make mistakes.
 That's what I miss, Denis, not you.
 Okay, gang, they fixed the gas leak, they're airing out the studio, we can start heading back up.
 Whoa, hold on a second.
 You think I'm just going to give up now, huh? I'm a Duffy, Liz.
 And us Duffys, we didn't give up when we got kicked out of Ireland.
 We didn't give up when America sent us back.
 And we didn't give up when Ireland then just set us adrift on a log, all right? Come on, it's not over, Liz! What a day! Miss Lemon's going to get Mr.
 Jordan back.
 We're going to do the best show ever, and out on the plaza, a bird landed on my apple! I though he was going to eat it, but he just sat there! What next? A different bird landing on a different apple? Where are you, Tray? I'm back, Liz Lemon.
 Tracy's back! Yes! Yes! I'm going to need an Obama cold open, a fart doctor, and you know what, write up that bum's Empire State Building idea.
 Fart doctor! No, I mean, I'm back to where I was yesterday.
 I can't get anyone mad at me.
 I even called the women's basketball team, "nappy-headed hos," but apparently I'm allowed to talk like that.
 Why? Tracy, come on! Tracy Jordan? Why isn't he here? I just had a meeting with News down on 4.
 Brian Williams sure gets close to you when he talks.
 Very feminine energy.
 Anyway, I thought I'd just swing by and introduce myself to Tracy Jordan, but Ah! He is here, he just likes to learn his lines in the bathroom and communicate by phone.
 Actors.
 Am I right? You know, I once had to speak to the Screen Actors' Guild.
 Bunch of nut jobs.
 But you couldn't make movies and TV without them.
 I'm just kidding.
 I mean, look at March of the Penguins.
 Who was in that? Good luck tonight.
 You're going to need it.
 Tracy, you can do this.
 You have to be at the show tonight! Tracy who? I don't even know who I am anymore! Look, you think the world has turned its back on you? I know a place where that's not true.
 A place where you can remember the man you used to be.
 A place where you can eat buffet ribs while someone's daughter shakes her crack at you.
 Tracy Jordan, I am taking you to a strip club! Oh, excuse me, Miss, how much is a lap dance? I'm a little light on cash, but I have a PayPal account.
 Oh, my God! Tracy Jordan? That's right, party time! When I saw you in Hard to Watch No, no, keep it light.
 you inspired me to contact my biological father.
 No daddy stuff.
 I hadn't spoken to him in 13 years.
 Maybe show him your butt! There are tears falling on her boobies, Liz Lemon.
 I know you've been molested.
 That's how we all got here.
 But I don't want to hear about it.
 I just wanted to let you know that I am going into the Navy.
 Because like you said in your movie, "I invent my tomorrow!" But I wasn't even supposed to say that.
 The line was "Shareen, I hope Doctor Mugutu has good news about my endoscopy.
" But I couldn't get it right, so they told me to improv.
 Come on, guys, I'm making it rain.
 You see what you've done, Liz Lemon? Tracy Jordan is broken.
 It's over.
 Get off the stage! No whites! You wanted to see me, Ms.
 Maroney? Oh, my! Candles, incense, disco music.
 Someone's getting into the Easter spirit! No, Kenneth.
 Do you remember that silly joke about me having your baby? Yes.
 So crazy! I know! It's crazy! Unless you're into it.
 What? No, ma'am.
 That would be wrong.
 We're not married.
 And we're different religions.
 We can do whatever we want.
 Ms.
 Maroney, I'd do anything for you, or Mr.
 Jordan, but this is wrong.
 But, Kenneth, you might be my only chance.
 No! Fine.
 I'll get you when you're sleeping! It's not rape if neither party really wants it! You're back! Yeah, this is my front.
 Thanks for setting me up with another classic quote.
 I borrowed your whale semen candle.
 It didn't work, by the way.
 You can keep it.
 I'm just packing up a few things and then I'm going.
 Wait, where are you going? I'm quitting show business.
 I can't stop the horrible respect people have for me.
 Tracy, you can't do that.
 Look, I would never say this on the record.
 Of course.
 This is all off the record.
 The show needs you.
 And I need you.
 I'd rather do the show than have a baby.
 But you don't understand.
 No, I do understand.
 Look at Roman Polanski.
 No, thank you.
 Or Elia Kazan.
 He told the government his friends were communists, then got a standing ovation at the Oscars! That's crazy! A man named Elia.
 That's a giraffe's name.
 You know, when you think about it, the only celebrities who completely undo their good will are the murderers.
 John Wilkes Booth, Phil Spector, O.
J.
 Simpson, who texted me earlier today.
 Shoot someone, huh? Nah, that's crazy, even for us.
 I guess it would take a pretty big gas leak to make you think that was a good idea! All right! 100th episode! Minus the commercials Hey, Dummy.
 Damn it! Look, Liz, if this is going to work out between you and me, you should know, my tarantula sleeps on my face.
 Oh, my God.
 My show is getting cancelled, I'm never speaking to Jack Donaghy again, and the worst thing that happened to me today is that you showed up.
 Yeah, 'cause you called me.
 When I was high on gas.
 Do you not understand what that means? No, not really.
 Gas has no effect on me at all.
 When I was growing up, my school, Gerry Cooney Elementary, it was right next to a gas works in Queens.
 It ventilated into the cafeteria.
 We got a big settlement from the city.
 Our parents voted to spend it on a boat that the families could share, but then that sank.
 But you know what? I'm still smart enough to know that I'll never do better than you, Liz Lemon, 'cause you're a cook in the bedroom, and a whore in the kitchen.
 So I'm going to give you one more shot to admit to me that you keep bringing me back into your life for a reason.
 Supas, take out the trash.
 Don't order me around, woman! No, I mean Denis, get out.
 I'll change your mind.
 Let's rock, Duffy.
 You again! Wait, you're not Sideways Jack! I'm Past Jack because I'm from the past and I'm you.
 Yeah.
 I get it.
 Do you? Because it seems like you don't get much of anything anymore, old man.
 If you're my future, I'm going to jump.
 Stop him! If he jumps, we don't exist any more.
 I'm perfectly aware of that.
 I studied Time Dilation and Quantum Teleportation in college.
 No, you didn't.
 You saw Time Cop! Really? I never saw Time Cop.
 You will.
 In 2007.
 And you'll love it.
 Why are you talking like that? This is how everyone talked in the '80s.
 This is how Reagan talked.
 Look, there's still time to fix this, Jack.
 You need to kick ass again! Starting with getting rid of that woman.
 Listen to him.
 He's awesome.
 And you know he's right.
 Fire Lemon.
 I don't know if I can do that.
 Well, then, check this! Oh, God! That only hurt me! Why did I think that would hurt you too? Jack, be the man you were meant to be: Me.
 This tuxedo is made out of the puma that I rode into my 50th birthday party.
 Why are you both wearing tuxedos? It's after 6:00.
 It's after 6:00.
 What are we, farmers? What are we, farmers? Now, go get rid of that woman.
 Just want to check everything out after your little gas scare.
 Well, my pen light is working.
 That's good.
 Now, can you say the alphabet for me? Well, a very very heavay uh heavay di birtation tonight we had a very derst dereson by let's go ahead and tear a station let's go la bip head an pip.
 Excellent.
 My God, Jenna, are you pregnant? How? Did you go swimming in a public pool? No.
 I got in my head about having a baby, and now I'm having a hysterical pregnancy.
 Well, that's redundant.
 All pregnancies are hysterical.
 They're started by penises.
 This should be perfect.
 I mean, all I want is the attention.
 So why am I not happy? I mean, on some level, do I want to have a baby? Do I want to be a mother? Should I be a mother? Bored.
 Hey, Greta Johansen, your animal wrangler.
 My God, you're beautiful! If you say goodbye tonight All I'll have will be my memories So keep on reaching for the light I now believe these are my memories My memories Mr.
 Jordan, I refuse to accept this is happening.
 You leaving is as crazy to me as evolution, or a woman's right to choose her haircut.
 I'm sorry, Ken, but maybe Jenna was right.
 The only way I could come back is if I shoot someone.
 And that's crazy! Or is it? Maybe it's a good idea.
 I don't know.
 It has a nice, simple logic to it.
 Why don't we take a deep breath, and then both say what we think we should do.
 You should shoot me I should shoot you on the roof of "30 Rock".
 On the roof of "30 Rock".
 I only ask one thing, sir.
 Make it quick.
 I cannot promise you that, Ken, I'm a horrible shot.
 To the roof! Hey, Dummy.
 Hey.
 You ready to sign that lease? You know how we were talking earlier about me moving in with you, and how hard it is to kick a tenant out in New York? Just think about it.
 I'll make you chili every night.
 I'll provide for you.
 I have a new business idea.
 It's like Netflix, but you go to a store and you pick out your video from a limited selection.
 It would be like 5 years ago.
 Exactly.
 I can move my stuff in tonight! Right? I just have one duffle bag and a sidecar.
 My motorcycle got impounded for being parked too awesome.
 I just need you to sign this lease I printed up off the Internet.
 Okay.
 I need a pen.
 You don't have a pen? You're a writer, Liz.
 All I have is this kick-ass laser pointer that I point at nerd's crotches in the park.
 No, wait.
 All we have is this kick-ass laser pointer.
 Come on, baby, let's go find a pen.
 Okay.
 Oh, no.
 Let me introduce myself.
 I am Future Jack, obviously.
 Is that what we're wearing in 10 years? More like 35 years.
 You're 87 years old? My God, I'm outstanding! I like to think so.
 I've come all the way from the future, which is a lot harder than coming from the past Whatever, Pops.
 to warn you not to listen to the other Jacks.
 In the future, you're happier than you ever imagined.
 You have grandchildren, and a gorgeous Polyblasian wife.
 That's a new race that emerges in 2030.
 They're incredible.
 What happened to Avery? Oh, you'll see.
 It's hilarious.
 Yeah, but what about his/your/our career? Don't we want to be this dude? Younger me's, business is only a part of life.
 Real happiness Eh, shut up.
 Don't listen to his crap, Jack.
 If you chose my path, you'll be plenty happy.
 You'll spearhead G.
E.
's development of the Electric Vagina.
 You won't be married, but you'll have a house with a lot of glass, and it's cold.
 And you'll own the Buffalo Bills.
 You didn't say it was the Bills.
 Look, right now Liz Lemon is downstairs about to sign a lease with Denis Duffy.
 If she does that, you'll lose her.
 In 3 years, they'll be married and living in Jacksonville, Florida, where he operates an unlicensed alligator park.
 Jacksonville? Her hair can't handle that humidity! No, I don't care.
 I'm tired of saving her.
 To quote Liz Lemon, "Opposite!" You'd be saving yourself.
 The only way to get my life is to be distracted from your blind ambition.
 And you can't do that without Liz Lemon in your life.
 Jack, this guy is just trying to justify his own bad choices.
 Go down there and fire Liz.
 Okay? We're obviously all thinking it, so I'm just going to say it.
 We're going to have sex with each other, right? Yeah, yeah.
 Oh, my.
 Lemon, don't sign that lease! Why are you here? Just sign it, Dummy.
 It's a receipt for some lez pants or whatever.
 No.
 If you have a problem, I will fight you, Denis.
 That wouldn't be very fair.
 I'm only trained to fight four or more men at a time.
 There are three more of me upstairs, and I'd be happy to go get them.
 I can't.
 I'd hurt my wrist.
 Hey, people, somebody sabotaged the gas line.
 People could have died.
 Or had fights.
 What? Who would do that? Hey, grab that black guy.
 It was you! What, are you mad at me, Liz? Huh? I did it for love.
 You're insane! Hey, hey, hey, guys, hands off the jacket, all right? It's from Amar'e Stoudemire's evening wear collection.
 If I ever see you again, I'll kill you.
 Please, you'll be back! All right, the gas is clearing out.
 You should be okay in time for the show according to my device here.
 Good work, Jennifer.
 Oh, my God, the show! I got to load in an audience, I got to distribute scripts, I got to change Jenna's blood.
 I need Kenneth! Forget about Kenneth.
 I told Hank Hooper that Tracy Jordan would be here.
 Where is the star of your show? Right here! I know you're talking about Tracy, but I don't care.
 Tracy and Kenneth went to the roof with a gun.
 Why? Because I gave Tracy the idea to kill the only man who would ever have a baby with me! Nothing to see here, Mr Hello, KableTown Family Members, and my favorite actress, Jenna, when 'TGS' gets cancelled, I mean, if, when 'TGS' gets cancelled, we need to talk about your future.
 I know what my future holds, Hank, motherhood.
 It surprised me, but I have so much love to give.
 Well, why couldn't you be a mother, and do a daytime talk show? Because the talk show would be my baby.
 I'm not going to be held back by some uterus turd! Let's call my agent.
 Oh, my God, your stomach! For some reason I'm starting to rethink this, sir.
 We all have doubt Kato Records, but we made a decision.
 And we'll look stupid if we don't follow through.
 Okay.
 Just please, tell my mother that My bad.
 That was an accident.
 Tracy, stop! Don't startle me when I'm holding a gun! Use your head, Liz Lemon! For God's sakes Tracy, give me that gun! Do you have any idea how much paperwork I would have to do if you shot Kenneth? I didn't know that Jack.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm just trying to get people to stop respecting me.
 Tracy, you want to destroy the good will you have so that you can go back to your easy TV job? Yes! Even more than I want to shoot Kenneth.
 Then all you have to do is go back to your easy TV job.
 What? Do TV.
 And no one will ever take you seriously again.
 Doesn't matter how big a movie star you are, even if you had the kind of career where you walked away from a blockbuster franchise, or worked with Meryl Streep, or Anthony Hopkins, made important movies about things like civil rights, or Pearl Harbor.
 Stole films with supporting roles, and then turned around and then blew them away on Broadway, none of that will matter once you do television.
 You could win every award in sight.
 And be the biggest thing on the small screen, and you'll still get laughed out of the Vanity Fair Oscar party by Greg Kinnear! Tracy, your career hit rock bottom the first time you decided to do 'TGS'.
 You want it to hit rock bottom again? Go on network television.
 Let's make some TV! We have 5 minutes! Ah, ah! Sorry, folks, while we were working on the gas line, we somehow broke the elevator.
 She's an old building.
 You're going to have to take the stairs.
 I'm okay! At least I made it through my last day.
 Darn it.
 Excuse me, the elevators are out.
 Do you know how Shut up! Well, if it isn't Jack and Kenneth, and Tracy, and Liz.
 Hey I have a bone to pick with the four of you.
 Screw, Williams! Hey, get out of our home! Sorry, recurring hobos.
 I'm back everybody.
 You're welcome for the adventure my absence provided.
 Liz, I was checking the cue cards, and we have a problem.
 It all seemed so funny when they were writing it.
 During Denis's gas leak! Yes, this will work.
 Just flip the top of Act 2.
 Danny can't make the wardrobe change that quick.
 Best show ever! Yeah! Guys, I don't know about this.
 Oh, my God.
 We don't have a show! Just start! I should call Denis.
 Let's meet our contestants.
 Dr.
 Steven Poop is a homemaker and a centaur.
 That did it.
 You're picked up for a billion more episodes! Where am I? Am I back in Vietnam? What charity are you playing for? The Grimace Foundation, Jeremy.
 Keep your milkshakes purple for over a million years! Hold on.
 Tracy's back on TV again? Clooney, Hanks.
 Actor emergency.
 Tracy Jordan's doing TV again.
 I know.
 Disappointing.
 Take him off the official A List.
 Well I don't have the password.
 Pitt's our webmaster.
 Well, then, wake him up! They're doing "Pam" again? Ugh! I don't care what you say anymore this is my life.
 Go ahead with your own life.
 Leave me alone.
 This may be the gas talking, but I was wrong about Denis.
 You're the guy who never left.
 And This is definitely the gas talking, but I'd be a lot worse off if I never met you, Lemon.
 And I'm proud to have you as a mentee.
 I mean, look at you.
 Endangering the lives of hundreds of people for a show that TV Guide once called "Still on.
" I framed that article.
 To 100 more episodes.
 Wow, 5 years.
 It makes you think about all the fun we've had together.
 But you know the single most amazing thing that's happened over the last 5 years? That is true, sir.
 But, today does make me wonder where we'll all be [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			Hush, island baby Tomorrow you'll shuck the cane Your little fingers bloody Prepare to be whipped She's asleep.
 Hey! It's Mommy! I'm in Beijing! Shh! Liddy just went to sleep.
 Well, wake her up, Jack! She needs to hear her mommy's voice.
 No, when she's ready, Dr.
 Kevorkian says we have to put her down.
 He's a very good pediatrician, but that is an unfortunate name.
 Oh, come on.
 She'll fall back asleep.
 No.
 Call back tomorrow.
 She has Babynomics at 11:00.
 Liddy! It's your mother! Lmprinting! Lmprinti God, Tracy could have cleaned up before he left.
 And why did he leave all this soda here? What are you doing? That's his urine.
 He is not well.
 Someday this place is gonna be a kick-ass duplex, like on "Diff'rent Strokes.
" Conrad Bain once slapped me in a men's room.
 I just got to get rid of all these boxes.
 I don't even know what this stuff is anymore.
 Comencé a estudiar these, but then yo gave up.
 Here's the novel I never finished.
 Hmm.
 "Liz stabbed Jenna repeatedly.
" The Secret? I gave you this five years ago.
 You still haven't read it? It works, Liz.
 Look at me.
 Ever since I started secreting, I've become a TV star, I found my soul mate.
 You saw how flat Gwyneth Paltrow sang at the Oscars.
 I visualized all of that.
 Jenna, the only way to make things happen in the real world is by taking action.
 Well, I've taken Action.
 It dries your mouth out, but the sex is amazing.
 No, I'm talking about taking control, like I do every day at work.
 I found Tracy, I saved the show, I always think of a third thing when I'm listing stuff.
 If taking control is so great, then how do you explain your personal life? I mean, look at the Post-it on your sweater.
 Oh, boy.
 You're right.
 I just have to care about myself as much as I care about work, starting right now.
 I'm gonna clean this apartment while I learn Spanish.
 Last year, I used The Secret to learn Spanish, and now I'm fluent.
 Rosa, I know you stole my necklace.
 I'll have your son deported.
 Oh, wait.
 I found my necklace.
 Oh, boy.
 Great news, Jack.
 I've got a new life philosophy that I call "Lizbeanism.
" I see.
 And how did you come up with that name? Well, I'm Liz, and obviously, my philosophy is simple, like a bean.
 I'm fixing problems in my personal life the same way I fix problems at work.
 I saved the show.
 Now I'm gonna save me.
 Because Lizbeanism means that I am a dike against the rising waters of mediocrity.
 Good for you, Lemon.
 Check this out, Jack.
 Tile samples.
 First, I redo the bathroom.
 Then I redo the whole apartment, and then, the world.
 I'm impressed, Lemon.
 You're talking like a winner.
 I'm going to give you one of my neckties.
 This is a big moment for me.
 You're taking control of your destiny.
 No matter how strait the gate or charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.
 That's from "Invictus.
" Wait, who was the white guy in that? Maybe someday you'll be like me, running a billion-dollar corporation, having people pay you for the privilege of cutting your hair.
 Raising a child.
 You're raising a child? Come on.
 I think Avery is probably doing that.
 Not really.
 Avery has been traveling a lot as part of "NBC News"' "Hot Blondes in Weird Places" initiative, so she's been out of the baby loop.
 Until Liddy is sleep-trained, frankly, it might be easier if Avery stays in Asia.
 Be careful what you wish for.
 According to The Secret, it'll come true.
 I wish Liz Lemon would leave so I could go back to work.
 Oh! Ugh! What's pulling me? I want to stay here and keep boring Jack! Oh! Okay! I really fell! I need help! Tracy, welcome back.
 I think I speak for all of us when I say how thrilled we Great impression of a guy that sucks, Dotcom! Look, we've got a lot of work to catch up on.
 Yes, sir! It just feels so good to have the Three Musketeers and Dotcom back together again.
 Smooth move, Ferguson.
 What are you laughing about? Oh, nothing, sir.
 Just an inside joke from when you were gone.
 You kind of needed to be there.
 No, no, no, no.
 No.
 You three are not allowed to have inside jokes that I'm not a part of.
 I could have inside jokes that you're not a part of, for example, "Hot feet" or "Ask Melissa about it.
" But my entourage serves me, and "Smooth move, Ferguson" is not funny to me, so it is forbidden, understand? Next order of business, Grizz's DVD reviews for this weekend.
 You wouldn't expect a movie called "Somewhere" to go absolutely nowhere.
 Sometimes we use a song to move a story along And explain it to you 'Cause Liz is taking charge She's in control of everything she do In her personal life Hey, hey, na, na In her personal life But here comes a story obstacle now What's that? Tony, there's a bag in that tree, and it's right outside the window of my soon-to-be-perfect-life apartment.
 If you're not in the building, I don't have to talk to you.
 Trees are city property.
 You have to take it up with City Hall.
 That's your mother, Liddy.
 Say hello.
 Who's ready for Skype sex? No, no, no.
 This is the Liddy call.
 What? I can't see.
 You people have too much money.
 Hi, Sherry! I don't know why our daughter would be afraid of Reagan.
 Are you accusing me of not doing enough Reagan time with her? No.
 Of course not.
 Listen, News wants me to extend the trip.
 But I can get out of it if you need me there to help.
 No.
 You stay.
 Are you sure? I'm sure.
 Bring back some throwing stars for Liddy.
 I will.
 And thank you for being the best husband ever.
 So, do you want to watch me eat jelly beans real slow? Yes.
 Smooth move, Ferguson! I knew it! I knew you were saying that behind my back.
 How long were you in there? I knew you wouldn't stop.
 And now your failure leaves us with only one option.
 Explain to me why "Smooth move, Ferguson" is funny.
 Well, while you were away, we ordered Mexican food, and the delivery guy tripped, and then Mr.
 Griswald said, "Smooth move, Ferguson.
" That story is not funny.
 Sir, you had to be there.
 Then I will be.
 We are going to re-create all the events surrounding "Smooth move, Ferguson" exactly as they occurred.
 Maybe then we can get on with our lives.
 Let's get to work! Jonathan, what is going on? Sir, you need to see this, even if it ruins whatever you had planned for Secretary's Day, like a poem you wrote for me or whatever.
 We go now to a pre-taped statement from super-crazy Korean dictator, Kim Jong-il.
 People of North Korea, it is your dear leader, Kim Jong-il, world's greatest golfer and movie director and best man at Tom Brady's wedding.
 As we all know, the decadent Western journalist spy Laura Ling left us because she can't party as hard as we can.
 I know, right? I know, right? But now another American reporter has come to North Korea because it's awesome and we have enough food.
 Her name is Avery Jessup, and, like me, her hair is blond! One of our own, NB C's Avery Jessup-Donaghy, detained in North Korea.
 More on that as it develops.
 But first, it's never too early to plan your dog's Halloween costume.
 I told her to stay.
 I didn't want her at home.
 This is my fault.
 Sir, if you say one more syllable, that's a haiku.
 Leave.
 I'm not afraid of you, City Hall.
 Let's do this.
 Don't go in there! Run, citizen! Look, Boehner, we're all upset.
 I mean, it's my wife.
 John, stop crying.
 I can't understand you.
 I said he's busy.
 Is he, Jonathan? I got a bag stuck in a tree.
 Jack, I have a bag stuck in a tree outside my apartment, and I can't get it down, and I don't know why it's making me so crazy Yes, you do.
 You said it yourself.
 It's not just about a bag or a view.
 It's about taking charge of your life and solving problems.
 I'm facing a similar situation myself.
 Lay it on me.
 Two-way street.
 Avery has been kidnapped by Kim Jong-il.
 What? Why? Is she a spy? Oh, my God, I already know too much! Kim Jong-il runs a vast propaganda machine.
 Evidently, his latest insane idea is to bring in a Western journalist to report on how the free world is being conquered by North Korea.
 And in food news, you've had enough to eat today.
 Now here with the weather is Johnny Mountain.
 North Korea, everything sunny all the time always! Good time beach party! Back to you, Alereeb! You have got to call President Clinton.
 He got Lisa Ling's sister out of North Korea.
 President InterBush is out of the question.
 Avery will never accept his help.
 She can't forgive him for not hitting on her during the 1996 Democratic Convention.
 She's much too thin.
 I do, of course, still have some connections, but my best bet is fraught.
 I never should have broken up with Condi via text message.
 You broke up with Condoleezza Rice by text? "Me plus you equals frowny face.
" Yeah, you can't call her.
 I know.
 But I am going to solve this, just like you are going to solve your equally important bag-in-a-tree situation.
 "Invictus," Lemon.
 Now that I've killed that bug, I'd like to call this "Smooth Move, Ferguson" re-creation meeting to order.
 Kenneth, report.
 Well, sir, we've got the delivery guy booked, but I've run into some big problems.
 For example, it was raining that day.
 Get a rain machine! Look, here, take my credit card.
 Use it to break into a special-effects warehouse to steal one.
 Well, sir, even if we did that, there are some things we can't control.
 We don't remember what we were wearing.
 Dotcom was sick Security footage.
 Dotcom licks the subway steps.
 These are solvable problems.
 Well, what about this? Miss Maroney was here, screaming at Mr.
 Rossitano.
 Later that day, she got her hair cut.
 Aw, thank you.
 The point is, her hair was longer then.
 J-Mo, how long would it take for your hair to grow back? It depends.
 Do you have access to horse semen? You know I do.
 Give me three weeks.
 Then, we'll reconvene in three weeks! Meeting is adjourned! Oh, my God! What happened to my bug? Stupid grappling hook! Can't catch one little bag? You think I'm giving up? Did I give up when that squirrel I trained to retrieve you just ran away? You will not win, Mr.
 Bag! But, Liz, I already have.
 What did you say? Jack's wrong.
 No human is truly the master of his fate.
 Even your dream apartment can't protect you from death.
 I'm not ruining your view.
 I'm reminding you of your mortality, 'cause you know I'll be here long after you're gone, the wind rustling against my genitals.
 That's right, bags have genitals.
 You don't know me.
 Go ahead, buy nesting tables.
 Paint an accent wall.
 I'll watch the EMTs take you out in my cousin, a body bag.
 K-9, Operation Ferguson status report! Rain, check.
 Room temperature, check.
 Ms.
 Maroney's hair length, check.
 Do you like it? If you say no, I'll drown myself.
 Mr.
 Griswald, could you put the TV on the right channel, MSNBC? Was Dotcom standing that gay? No, sir, he was not.
 today denying reports that Jessup-Donaghy is anchoring a fake Western news channel, calling the accusations "as ridiculous as the dunk Kim Jong-il won the NBA dunk contest with.
" Hey, what's my boy KJ doing on TV? What? That's Kim Jong-il.
 Yeah.
 We did a movie together that he directed and co-starred in.
 Death to the CIA! Let us all increase production of millet and sunflowers! I defuse bomb, black partner.
 Hasta la vista, baby.
 Dude, I think you did a North Korean propaganda film.
 It was either that or play a rapping doorman in a Kate Hudson movie.
 Oh, okay.
 He's coming.
 Places, everyone.
 Smooth move, Ferguson.
 I get it now! It's so funny! Everyone, laugh! Now, you sons of bitches! Tracy, it's come to my attention that you know Kim Jong-il, and obviously, I'm concerned about my wife, and I want to know what she's going through.
 Please, hold nothing back.
 Okay.
 But you might not like what I have to tell you.
 Kim Jong-il sometimes shoots in the closeup too much.
 Comedy lives in the wide shot.
 And also this is gonna be rough his acting notes are often vague.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 What is this? Oh, my God! They're letting her speak! For the past three weeks, I have been honored to partake in a political re-education regimen.
 I have voluntarily taken several floggings for being an arrogant American That's okay.
 She's tough.
 We do a lot of pirate-themed sexual role-play.
 I'm a parrot.
 Also, I spend eight hours a day breaking concrete blocks to learn to be an obedient worker No problem.
 She pays $1,000 an hour to do that with her trainer.
 and I have concluded that capitalism may be flawed.
 My God! What are those monsters doing to her? Dr.
 Rice? Well, look what the cat dragged in.
 Hello, Condi.
 You're looking well.
 You know, I've been to the DMZ.
 They have signs.
 Can your wife not read? Okay.
 We're all adults here So, what is it? Is she funnier than I am? She's certainly not younger, is she? Condi, we are not doing this.
 Oh, we are doing this.
 I'm sorry that I broke up with you by text.
 I'm sorry I went drinking with Karl Rove on Valentine's Day.
 I'm sorry that I said your favorite movie was lame.
 "Mars Attacks!" is awesome! Now, admit that I'm better at the piano than you are at the flute.
 Never! Follow this, you turkey! All right, damn it! You are better.
 I'll see what I can do, Jack.
 Now, get out of here before this gets weird.
 You're the turkey.
 You know what, Mr.
 Bag? I will have a nice day! I'm gonna hang you in my kitchen and fill you with other bags! You will eat your family! Hey! That's city property! Put the saw down! No, no, I almost got him! Right now! Look, don't think I won't taser you, all right? I got OCD, and I love doing paperwork.
 It's worth it! Avery? Jack! Oh, thank God! I forgot the U.
S.
 Country code, but then I remembered, it's number one! How are you calling me? Nobody here's ever seen an iPhone.
 I told them it was my razor.
 I have to shave my legs with it, but they have an app for that.
 Oh, Avery, I'm sorry.
 This is all my fault.
 I told you to stay.
 No.
 This is nobody's fault.
 Except maybe that pansy Harry Truman for not taking down this country when he had the chance.
 Truman! Look, my battery's dying, and the outlets here are shaped weird, and I don't think they have any electricity in them anyway, so I don't want you to worry about me.
 They actually love me here.
 I already won a North Korean Emmy.
 So if I don't ever make it home Avery, don't say that.
 I spoke to Condoleezza.
 Really? Did you also call Sally Ride and her sister? Come on, Avery.
 Not now.
 I am going to get you out of there.
 You are married to Jack Donaghy, damn it, and the world doesn't get to do this to us.
 We control our fates! We are in charge! Avery? Are you still there? I'm sure her battery died right after I finished that speech, just like I wanted it to.
 Smooth move, Ferguson! Smooth move, Ferguson! Mr.
 Jordan, please, let it go.
 It's just a joke.
 It's not about the joke.
 It's about what the joke represents, you monsters! What do you mean, sir? I came back, and you were fine without me.
 You laughed without me! And that was our special thing.
 But no, you thought "Smooth move, Ferguson" was so hilarious.
 It wasn't! It wasn't funny! There, are you happy? You dropped a bomb, K! Continue! We were miserable without you, sir.
 "Smooth move, Ferguson" was just trying to fill a void because Mr.
 Slattery's political cartoons weren't cutting it.
 I can't draw hands.
 You're the one who makes us laugh.
 Never go away again.
 Don't ever tell me what to do! Quad hug, me in the middle! Also, due to a paperwork mix-up, you will not be getting paid this month! I did it, Jack! I got the bag! You were right.
 No matter how much the gate is strait or who punishes the scrolls, I am the captain of my holes.
 Or whatever.
 We are in control! No, we aren't.
 I was wrong.
 Condi tried, but Avery plus freedom equals frowny face.
 I'm sorry, what's happening? They're never going to let her go.
 Avery is now married to Kim Jong-il's son, Kim Jong-un.
 What? No! Mortality! Smooth move, Ferguson.
 Put that coffee down.
 Coffee's for closers only.
 I'm here from Park and Kim.
 I'm here on a mission of mercy.
 Your name's Levene? Yeah.
 You call yourself a salesman, you son of a bitch? I don't have to listen to this.
 No, you don't, pal, 'cause the good news is, you're fired.
 Oh, have I got your attention now? The leads are weak.
 The leads are weak? You're weak! Luke, I am your father.
 Ghostbusters.
 Let's go, black partner! [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			All right, now that the popsicle's melted, we've got ourselves a tongue depressor.
 I wanted you to look at these cold sores.
 I get them when I'm stressed out.
 They're nothing to be ashamed of.
 I get them from prostitutes.
 I've just had a hard couple months.
 Work has been crazy, and I went through a bad breakup, and then there was this plastic bag that represented my death Sounds like you could use a little R and R, rum and Ritalin.
 Actually, I was hoping you'd just have an ointment for my mouth Gross! 'cause I'm dealing with the stress thing.
 Over the break, I'm renting a cottage out in the Hamptons.
 There's just four things I want to do this summer be outdoors, wear shapeless clothing, do some mindless activity like gardening, and learn Spanish.
 There are four things I want to do this summer, but they're roommates, so it's tricky.
 All right.
 Here's a prescription for your cold sores, and here's a blank one for the weekend.
 Now, one final thing why aren't you wearing pants? The other doctor told me to take them off.
 Other doctor? That's my brother Randy! Tomorrow he's going to jail for the rest of his life.
 Good one, Randy! You want to go to Taco Bell for lunch? Hey.
 Stop right there.
 I know that people are feeling sorry for me because my wife was kidnapped by Kim Jong-il I know.
 but I do not need your pity, and I am tired of hearing that tone of voice.
 Aw.
 Hey.
 Hey, buddy.
 Hey, I know what you're going through.
 I once kidnapped a woman.
 I know.
 Stop talking like that, Lemon.
 I'm trying to, but I'm kind of locked in, sweetie.
 The voice is controlling me now.
 Help me? Look, obviously this has been difficult.
 I'm not sleeping.
 Last night I sat in front of the TV and ate an entire carton of foie gras.
 I can hardly drink my morning-shower Scotch.
 I miss Avery.
 It's the little things I miss most.
 On a day like this, we would go to Strawberry Fields in Central Park and kick hippies' hacky sacks into the bushes.
 Look, you need to reset and try to feel normal again.
 Normal? I don't know what normal is anymore.
 Normal is a woman and a woman getting married and having a child.
 What? Is me being a bummer helping you feel like your old self? Keep it coming.
 Bush is a war criminal! There's so much texting going on these days and no communicating! Carbon tax! Please leave! That's the spirit! Well, I'm off.
 Have a good summer, Jenna.
 Oh, I will.
 Do you remember when I performed during halftime at the Wool Bowl? It was on ESPN 34.
 You can't spell "America" Without w-o-o-I It's all better in wool A singer, everyone! Woolly the Wool Mascot, everybody! The sponsors were so happy with me, they're now naming me the new celebrity face of wool! How exciting! Every year, my aunt sends me a wool sweater for Christmas.
 We get it, Aunt Alice, you're a sheep.
 Also, this is very lucrative.
 Paul and I can finally buy that time-share in Betasten Bos, Amsterdam's premier private sex garden.
 There have genetically-altered men there with minotaur heads that chase you through the brambles.
 Okay.
 Well, good-bye, my closest female friend.
 Oh, my God.
 The season's over.
 Why are you losers still here? Final melee, Liz.
 It's the last game of the season, and no one wants to lose.
 You have no summer plans? Well, David Eggers and I Oh, shut up! Frank, you have a girlfriend.
 And Lynn wants me to give up video games 'cause she thinks I need to grow up.
 How's this for grown up? Last night, for dinner, I put milk in my Apple Jacks.
 Ha! I distracted you, and you died.
 Game over.
 No, I shot my bazooka at the ground to kill myself 'cause Toofer had me cornered.
 Now I respawn and start over.
 So you're killing yourself rather than let someone else win? That's why everyone has zero kills and we've been playing for 18 hours.
 I'm wearing a diaper, like a baby would.
 Wow.
 I can't wait to get out of here.
 For three months.
 It's gonna be glorious.
 Hi, neighbor.
 I'm Ina Garten.
 My husband, Jeffrey, is away, and I've got some bruschetta and a white wine opened.
 Why don't you come over? I'm alive! All I have left is to pay the fine that I incurred for committing a hate crime against what the city is now claiming was a Jewish tree.
 And I'm free.
 Have a great summer.
 I'm not one for good-bye speeches, but I do feel Lutz, what are you doing? Don't look at me! Jenna, this is a great day for the Wool Council.
 Well, I am very proud to be your new spokeswoman.
 You know, in the past, I was the face of Clinique, a French-Canadian anal-rejuvenation clinic, and I was the feet of FilthyLittleFeet.
 Com.
 Yes, well, about that.
 Jenna Wool is a wholesome fabric, which is why your contract includes a morality clause.
 You will be required to conduct your personal life in a manner which is consistent with the values of this industry.
 Oh.
 Of course.
 We're just a little worried about publicity like this.
 No, Eugene.
 That's not just some guy I picked up at a dog bar.
 Paul and I are in a committed relationship.
 Is he a cross-dresser? Goodness, no! Paul is a gender-dysmorphic bigenitalian pansexualle.
 I see.
 Maybe we should take a few days and think about this.
 No.
 Whenever men say that, I never see them again.
 You just need to meet Paul.
 Our relationship is everything that wool is about love, warmth, chafed skin.
 Oh, noble sheep We eat your babies We use your brain To fight off rabies But the most beautiful gift you give us Is wool All right, Jenna.
 I'd love to meet Paul.
 Let's say dinner tomorrow night at your place.
 I'll bring my wife.
 Excellent.
 I should warn you, this had better be a very normal dinner.
 No high jinks, no farce, not just for the sake of your relationship with the National Wool Council, but for the sake of my wife, whose parents were killed in front of her while an episode of "Three's Company" was You know what? I'll let her tell the story at dinner.
 Wool-come, Jenna.
 Sherry, who was at the door? Kenneth, what are you doing? Well, I know your wife was kidnapped by some convenience-store owners, and I'm real sorry about that.
 I'm not looking for pity.
 Pity? Sir, back in Stone Mountain, people lose their spouses all the time.
 Mumps, Hill People attacks, cave collapses both business and residential.
 Continuing my list Kenneth What do you want? When someone needs help, we don't waste time feeling sorry for them.
 We help them.
 And you seem like you could use a home-cooked meal.
 Oh, that smells delicious.
 It's an old Parcell family recipe.
 But I like to replace the Union-soldier meat with boiled potatoes.
 I haven't eaten at this table since Avery's been gone.
 That was her chair.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 No, please sit.
 You two have similar-shaped buttocks.
 Deer God, thank you for this venison.
 Onion God, thank you for these onions.
 Carrot God, thank you for the carrots.
 Spanish for Older Women, Lesson 12, Emergencies.
 Disaster approaching.
 Desastre inminente.
 Desastre inminente.
 Fore! Oh, my God! Liz? It's Tracy, from work! What are you doing here? I just bought everything around this house.
 It's supposed to be a nice area, except for the "new element" everyone keeps talking about.
 Look, I got a long night of shooting guns in the air ahead of me.
 Do you mind if I take a nap here? Of course you're my neighbor.
 I wanted a normal summer, and chaos is my normal.
 If I start screaming in my sleep, do not wake me up.
 I will attack you.
 Wake me up! Free me from this! Ah, Kenneth.
 Thank you for dinner last night.
 It was nice to hear a woman's laugh in the house again.
 You're bad! I thought maybe we could do it again tonight.
 Oh, sir, I'd love to, but I can't.
 Why not? Well, I have to work.
 Now that the crew is gone, I like to give everything a good spring cleaning, starting in the bathroom.
 There's a lot of drawings of Ms.
 Maroney eating celery that men are giving to her with their hips.
 I see.
 Another time, perhaps.
 I'll just be alone in a house full of memories.
 My house is full of white cockroaches.
 Hi, sweetie! I got you an early anniversary present.
 It's a new leash for when I walk you through the park like a dog.
 Weather's supposed to be nice and muddy tomorrow.
 What's wrong? Look, I'm the face of wool now.
 I need to maintain a certain image.
 So, what, we can't be ourselves? Just not in public.
 We can do whatever we want here.
 Except tonight.
 Mr.
 Gremby is coming over for dinner.
 Eugene Gremby from the Wool Council? Tonight? I just want him to meet you and see us together.
 Then he'll get it.
 He'll understand what we have.
 But the Grembys are pretty conservative.
 Maybe you should change.
 Really? This is a conservative top, Jenna, and I hate to be the stereotypical man, but this is my home, and I want to wear this blouse.
 Paul, please, you need to change.
 Okay.
 I'll change.
 And I'll cancel the sitter for tonight, tell him he won't need to come sit on us after all.
 Oh, you've just made a very dangerous enemy, Kenneth.
 Thanks for the heads-up, Jonathan.
 Do you want to come to my birthday party? What are you doing? That's my job.
 Jonathan volunteered to clean up so you could come over again tonight, right, Jonathan? But, sir, it's not just the bathrooms that need cleaning.
 That's why Jonathan's family is here.
 Liddy goes down at 7:00, so I'll see you then.
 Oh, my.
 Liz Lemon.
 Any idea when your party will be over, Tray? The party hasn't started.
 That's just the guys setting up.
 Can I borrow a cup of sugar? I'm trying to get a hummingbird to drink out of my penis.
 I can't do this, Tracy! This is supposed to be my vacation.
 I wanted to spend it learning Spanish, not living next door to you.
 I give up.
 Of course I'm not allowed to be a human being.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 You didn't want to live next door to your friend, after all I've done for you? How many times have I come over and painted your apartment? Three.
 And by the way, stop doing that.
 Or maybe you're saying we're not friends.
 That's fine.
 I don't think it will affect my behavior next season.
 The sad woman has been trapped by the idiot.
 La mujer triste ha sido atra We're friends.
 Next year's gonna be fine 'cause we're good friends.
 We're sp spending the summer together.
 Great! I'll come over tomorrow morning.
 Okay.
 Well, since you've just been staring at me like that for the last 20 minutes I'm gonna scoot on out of here.
 Don't go, Avery.
 I mean, Kenneth.
 Sir, you called me Avery! That's your kidnapped wife's name.
 What a coincidence! I haven't slept in days.
 I'm not really feeling like myself.
 You know, in the evening, Avery and I would sit together and talk.
 It was a nice way to unwind.
 I bet you miss Put on these earrings.
 So.
 Tell me about your day.
 Well I got a soft yes from Jonathan about my birthday party.
 Then I went to a very uncomfortable dinner.
 Do you know what I did today? Tried to be strong, sat alone with my thoughts.
 Then I went to a wonderful dinner.
 Then the dinner ended? So, Paul, what do you do? I am in the restaurant business, and I really love golf playing.
 Is that so? What's your handicap? Oh.
 Well, I don't have one myself, but I do like a girl with a limp.
 Paul So, Mrs.
 Gremby, you're also named Eugene? Oh, no, dear, it's U-period-Jean.
 My first name is U.
 Jean, with a U.
 Oh.
 That's a nice blouse.
 It definitely goes with your eyes, don't you think, Jenna? Golf, blouses.
 I'm just so impressed with how normal this dinner has been.
 Very wool.
 Greetings, slaves! Who's ready to get sat on? Sir, I don't know who you are, but you are not wanted here! Didn't you get my text? I thought it was part of the game.
 We are good people who have no interest in being sat on, so don't spew your statistics on the health benefits of weekly sittings or its wide acceptance in Eastern cultures.
 Paul.
 We're normal! And being normal is American, and it's respectable, and it makes us happy.
 Now, get out of here.
 Well done, sir.
 Bravo.
 You handled that pervert with aplomb.
 Very wool! To tomorrow's photo shoot and wool.
 Shh! Unbelievable! You're still here? It's still 0-0-0.
 To 0.
 I did it! I spoke! This didn't get mailed.
 What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be out in the Hamptons not getting invited to stuff? I came back for the day.
 Tracy lives next door to me.
 I can't leave, I can't stay.
 I'm trapped.
 Speaking of trapped, I got you, Lutz! Nope.
 Grenade.
 Blowing myself up.
 Oh, my God.
 That's what I have to do.
 I can be a normal person.
 I have to blow myself up.
 No, Your Honor, I'm not disputing the fine.
 I'm refusing to pay it.
 Grenade, respawn! Miss I mean, ma'am read the fine print.
 If you don't pay, I can sentence you to up to three weeks of community service.
 How about three months? This is a sham, Your dis-Honor! Nay, a mockery! I put the system on trial.
 You can't handle the truth! I'm out of order? You're out of order! Victor Sifuentes! Hoo-ah! Gavel, gavel, gavel! I lost my gavel over the weekend, but it doesn't mean you can talk to me like that.
 Talk to who? I just see an empty robe.
 Do you honestly not see me, or are you being rude? I'm being rude.
 That's it! of community service! You'll spend your whole summer picking up trash.
 Gavel, gavel, gavel! Freedom! For me.
 Probably not you guys.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, where are my clothes? Sherry must have put them in the wash while you were showering.
 Now, give us a twirl.
 This is not right, sir.
 Now, what do you say you put on some of Avery's perfume and we head over to Strawberry Fields and whip pennies at the drum circle? I don't like to swear, sir, but no, thank you.
 Now, maybe I haven't had a wife who was kidnapped, but I have seen "The Brady Bunch" where Tiger runs away.
 We've all been through some bad stuff, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I had the perfect woman.
 Gorgeous.
 Brilliant.
 Always let me be the hat in Monopoly.
 Why is this happening to me? God, are you punishing me because my hair is better than yours? All right, sir, enough.
 You wanted me to be Mrs.
 Donaghy? Well, I know Mrs.
 Donaghy, and she is mean.
 She once made Rahm Emanuel cry in an airport lounge.
 So, fine, I will be Mrs.
 Donaghy.
 And I'm gonna say Listen to me, Jack! You don't want people to pity you? Well, they should, because you are pitiful.
 You think you're all alone, "Boo-hoo, why can't my life be the way it was?" Well, it can't.
 And you are not alone.
 You have a daughter you should be spending time with instead of being weird to Kenneth.
 He may be a chinless piece of human garbage, but he will never fill the void that I left behind.
 Oh, look, here he comes now.
 He's gonna ask me to go to his birthday party.
 Hey, Mrs.
 Dongy, you wan' come on down my birfday party? No.
 I can't.
 But I know Jack can.
 Kenneth, Kenneth.
 I get it.
 Sherry? Put Liddy's baby pantsuit on.
 I'm taking her to work with me today.
 All right, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 And, uh, thank you Avery.
 Here's to you, Jenna Maroney.
 Even with your back to me, I can definitely tell it's you.
 I'll turn around later.
 Perfect.
 I'll keep talking.
 Mmm, wool.
 You know, my wife, U.
 Jean, is out of town visiting her parents' graves.
 Maybe we could meet later for a drink and you could show me your front.
 We could do that.
 Now! Paul? And Jenna.
 Oh, my God! I'm finally taking a stand, after all these days.
 You wanted us to be normal? Well, this is our normal, and this is what we think of your morality clause.
 Give Mommy some beard.
 Oh, you've got some crumbs in here.
 Oh, eat it.
 Good God! Lemon? Liddy, say, "Good God, Lemon.
" Guh gah, Lem.
 I did it, Jack.
 I got my dream vacation.
 You're on a chain gang.
 I'm outdoors, I'm wearing comfortable clothes, I'm gardening, and I'm learning Spanish.
 I vuelve a tu trabajo, Limona! Esa bolsa no está llena.
 Estoy hablando con mi amigo.
 De todos modos, ésta es mi tercera bolsa.
 ¡ Grítale a Héctor! Liddy and I just went to Strawberry Fields, where she spat up on a white lady's dreads.
 It's nice to see that we're back to our version of normal.
 Jenna? Oh, Jenna, no.
 There you are! Bad dog! You'll go in the crate tonight.
 Hey, Jack.
 Hey, Liz.
 Ow! Fore! Hey, guys! It's me, Tracy, the black guy from work.
 What are you doing? I hooked a ball onto a truck on the Long Island Expressway.
 And Tracy Jordan does not take mulligans.
 Good thing you had to move out of that house.
 Some idiot rammed his boat that I was driving into it.
 You see all the good that is in them, how much capacity for love? Yes, I know.
 I just need more time with them.
 Give me more time, Jacob, I beg of you! No, I see you.
 I'm killing myself.
 Respawn.
 Respawn.
 Damn it! Hola, everyone.
 Are you ready for Season 6? Oh, my God.
 Wait, how long have we been here? [Dinsdale]   

                




                    			 Jason, I really like your look.
 You had it poppin' tonight.
 I totally disagree.
 Because I love your look.
 You're a star.
 Believe in your dreams.
 Thank you.
 Jason, have you ever put out a cigar on Gilbert Gottfried's neck? Because I have, and his screams were the worst thing I'd ever heard.
 Until tonight.
 Congratulations, you're a disgrace.
 Ah! I rolled my ankle.
 God! Also, Jason, if you think you're passing for straight, you're embarrassing yourself.
 that show last night.
 Not me.
 I've got better things to do than watch Jenna humiliate children.
 So you don't care that Shayla made it to the next round? How? She is so pitchy.
 What can I tell you? The audience just loves Shayla's personal story.
 Did you know that both her mothers are serial killers? That's America.
 So, did you miss me over the break? Of course.
 A little less than my kidnapped wife, but I did get a nice Christmas card from Avery and Kim Jong-Un.
 At least I had some quality time with Liddy.
 She's like a little human tumbler of scotch.
 You turning soft on me, Donaghy? If you want, I can recommend a good gynecologist.
 You know, 'cause I really like my guy.
 He's sort of a doogie howser type.
 But younger.
 Aren't you going to ask me how my No.
 I know exactly how your holidays were.
 You took the train to your parents' house.
 On Christmas Eve, you forgot that eggnog has alcohol in it, and got into a shoving match with your aunt about who puts the star on top of the tree.
 It was my year! What, lupus lets you just cut the line? You received two sweaters that you didn't really like and got your dad a book on world war ii that he already owned.
 Wow, you really think you know everything about me, don't you? Yes, after six years I really do.
 Well, I will have you know that there are aspects of my life about which you know nothing.
 Take off that jacket.
 If you're not wearing one of those Christmas sweaters out of guilt, I'll give you $1,000.
 Wrong, Jack.
 'Cause they weren't sweaters.
 They were Dickies! Happy 2012! Good morning, Mr.
 Rossitano.
 I'm sorry you're going to hell.
 That's okay.
 How was your break? Wonderful.
 Reverend Gary did the math, and guess what? The world is ending tomorrow! And you're happy about that? Oh, of course.
 I get to go to heaven and receive my reward! hold the salt.
 Oh, I'm sorry I won't be seeing you in heaven, Mr.
 Spurlock.
 But on the bright side, black hell does have a jukebox.
 So you think this is your last day on Earth.
 Well, I'll leave the thinking to other religions.
 Well, you must have things you want to do before you die.
 Is the sky blue? Until tomorrow, when it will be on fire.
 Then you should go and do them.
 I came across the following quote on the side of a tampon box this Christmas.
 "Work like you don't need the money.
 "Love like you've never been hurt.
 "Dance like nobody's watching.
 Enjoy these satchel Paige brand tampons.
" You know what miss Lemon? I will do that.
 Thank you.
 You're just giving him the day off? That's awfully nice.
 I'm a nice person.
 Because I'm a happy person.
 My happiness makes me nice.
 Also, maybe I'm in a good mood because I'm not being weighed down by redundant torso fabric.
 What does that mean? Wouldn't you like to know? Amazing news, Liz.
 I made the People magazine crossword.
 One across, five letters, "Jenna Maroney's first name".
 Wow! Congratulations.
 Because of America's kidz got singing, I am blowing up.
 When you Google "Jenna Maroney" now, I come up first.
 Not the Jenna Maroney who electrocuted all those horses.
 Jenna, that was you.
 Anyway, I'll be back for rehearsal after I tape the show.
 Talent walking! This has nothing to do with Jenna's success that I'm jealous of, but if that yellow-haired bag of teeth keeps me waiting for rehearsal, I will set my dressing room on fire.
 Okay, first of all, Tracy, you know you're the real star.
 Huh.
 You know what? I'm not doing this.
 But I'm acting out.
 Right.
 And I know it'll all blow over eventually, and so I'm just going to skip the exhausting middle part.
 But you're supposed to control me.
 You're Liz Lemon.
 That's what you do! You're a 42-year-old man.
 No, I'm not.
 I took a real age test.
 It said I'm dead.
 Hey, I was just going to call you.
 You wanna watch today's Kidz taping? We're kicking off "Public domain week".
 This week, America's kids sing really old songs that everyone knows and NBC doesn't have to pay for.
 It's brilliant.
 Wow, more money.
 This thing's a real cash cow.
 Unlike cash cow, the failed NBC spin-off of cash cab.
 You try riding a cow through midtown Manhattan, Lemon.
 The animal will panic.
 Right.
 Anyway, I was just going to call you because I'm wondering why I received an email confirming my membership in a dating service called desperationships.
com.
 Because after 6 years, I know you're depressed after spending the holidays alone.
 I'm not depressed, Jack.
 And I don't need some dumb dating website.
 What if I told you your first match burned his groin off in an accident at his cake shop.
 No.
 Not interested.
 Five minutes.
 Show's getting started.
 I'd better get in there.
 I'll see you soon.
 Five minutes to tape, everyone.
 Die, you blonde bitch! Thank you.
 Is that your daughter? She's adorable.
 Thanks.
 She's my angel.
 Her name's Liddy.
 Oh.
 Ha.
 That's odd, because my daughter's name I'm going to interrupt you right there, Liddy.
 Terrible song selection.
 You were sharp.
 And I'm about to get raw with you.
 You're weird looking, Liddy.
 Even if you could sing, with that face it would be like eating a steak that just came out of a dumpster.
 I've done that.
 Here's my advice, Liddy.
 Go work on your presentation.
 Take voice lessons.
 Then seal yourself in a barrel, and fall off of the waterfall.
 You leave Liddy alone! I need it quiet to record my catchphrase.
 Sebastian, I'm going to give you a few options.
 Love it, Jenna! Go.
 Is this your show? Liddy, go jump back up your mother.
 Liddy, go jump back up your mother.
 Go jump back up your mother, Liddy.
 Yeah, I like the third one for me, and her crying on the second one.
 I love it.
 Brilliant, Jenna.
 Hello, Mr.
 Hornberger.
 Kenneth, what are you doing? Sir, this chiquita banana sticker had been stuck to that ceiling for years.
 So I finally scraped it off.
 No, listen.
 You can do whatever you want today.
 I know! Isn't it great? I'm finally doing my dream chores.
 Give me that.
 "Scrape sticker off ceiling, "fix that humming noise only I can hear, organize snack table by food jewishness" Kenneth, this stuff isn't even your job.
 That's why they're dream chores.
 Look, if it was my last day on Earth I wouldn't be here, I'd be with Paula, admitting I'm in love with her twin sister.
 Kenneth, we were just out on the Plaza, and four flaming horses rode by.
 Reverend Gary says super-gay horses are one of the signs of the apocalypse.
 Exactly! The end is nigh.
 You should raise your hopes up even higher than they are now.
 I will.
 I did! We have a problem, Liz Lemon.
 I just remembered, I started a camp for underprivileged kids last summer.
 We have to drive upstate to see if any of them are still alive.
 That sounds like a Tracy problem, Tracy.
 Okay, how about this? I'm changing my name.
 From now on everyone has to address me as "the gentleman formerly known as rectum.
" Pay attention to me, L.
L, or else I'm going to do something self-destructive.
 I just got an honorary sheriff's badge, and I'm going to start making real arrests.
 Great.
 I just realized, I haven't paid taxes in 30 years.
 Oh, we're not doing the pre-tape tonight because I'm leaving at 6:00.
 What's going on with you? Why are you acting so weird? I don't know what you're talking about.
 You're not doing your job.
 You're laughing at rectum jokes, you're leaving early.
 Did we switch brains? Why am I not feeling your boobs? Baah! What is happening!? Jenna.
 We need to talk about Kidz.
 Did you see last night's ratings? The only show I've ever been on that got a 10.
2 was when Mickey Rourke threw me onto the field during the super bowl.
 Obviously I'm thrilled about the show's success, but I wanted to talk to you about youronscreen persona.
 I had an idea B.
B.
 Gun.
 Actually, I think the mean thing may have run its course.
 What if you went the other way, and you were nice to the kids? Well, no.
 I mean, being the nice one is McEnroeâs thing.
 Ah, yes, well, we've done some focus testing, and frankly I haven't seen such a unanimously negative response since the Frasier spin-off, hey, Roz.
 Jenna, they hate you.
 No, Jack.
 They love to hate me.
 Kidz is minting money for both of us.
 And what's more important than money? Well, perhaps we could make even more money by pretending to be nice.
 I mean, look at Betty White.
 End of discussion.
 Just ease off on the kids.
 Look, according to Tracy, people are switching minds around here.
 That's obviously what's happened.
 So whoever you are, show me Jack's penis.
 That's for you.
 Damn, I've got to get more of these.
 I don't know what this is, but I like it.
 Ha, finally.
 After 6 years, I've cheered up miss Lemon.
 That was on your list? I'm not always in a bad mood.
 And I happen to be in a really good place right now.
 Well, enjoy it while you can, because tomorrow, you're going to women's hell.
 Uh, also, FYI, women's hell is the same as aroused dog heaven.
 Kenneth.
 Why are you still here? This is your last day on Earth.
 There's so much you haven't done.
 Oh, sir, I've done plenty.
 Oh, really? Have you ever been in love? Only while playing tennis.
 I'm kidding.
 I've never played tennis.
 Have you ever been in an airplane? Well, does falling off a bridge in a horse cart count? Have you ever stood on a beach and watched the sun rise? Sir, I've never even seen the ocean.
 Never? Kenneth, that's insane.
 We were all put on this crazy blue marble for a reason To love, and live.
 What is going on with you? Everyone's talking about how weird you're acting.
 What are you on? You know what? I have seen the ocean on a can of tuna.
 Newsflash, Kenneth! Everybody get down! It's not going to happen.
 The world's not ending.
 Oh, the rapture is happening, sir.
 Mr.
 Rossitano said he saw the snakes making peace with the mice.
 You're like a child.
 He's messing with you.
 And you know what? In the words of my father, "you deserve to be disappointed.
 Merry Christmas.
" Can I talk to you, Jennifer? Tracy, how do nice people dress? Socks on their hands, no belt, roller skates.
 Do you think Liz Lemon has been acting weird lately? She's hiding something from us.
 Like what? A present? For me? Can I return it for cash? No, this is bigger than that.
 Something like a sex-change operation or a secret pregnancy or a radioactive spider bite.
 I've got to get her focus back on me, or who knows the dumb stuff I'm going to start doing? Is that why you're not wearing pants right now? Yes! I'm actually glad this happened.
 You're proving my point.
 Look, if you think something's going on with Liz, just follow her.
 Steal her mail, go through her trash.
 That's what Paul and I do to maintain intimacy when he's having his period.
 Thanks J-Mo.
 Great advice.
 Breathtaking.
 You're the wind beneath my wings.
 Brock Ilike what you did.
 That was good singing.
 You don't have a little rat face, you opposite of a turd with eyes.
 Why are you messing with perfection, Jack? You need to remember that reality television is formulaic before you get us canceled.
 Because I will not go back to putting hair extensions on dogs.
 Easy, d'Fwan.
 Yeah, we have a problem, but we're going to get through it, 'cause we're family.
 It's not working.
 You're ruining the show.
 You think I don't know that it's not working, Jenna.
 Next week Jay-Z was going to do a duet with one of the spinning chairs from the Voice, and the chair just pulled out.
 You're off the leash, Jenna.
 Did you see what happened here? We turned an argument into an opportunity to become better friends.
 Aw.
 I'll see you in heaven, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Ken, I only have room in my brain for one problem, so I'm not really absorbing what you're saying.
 I have to go through Liz Lemon's trash before she gets in.
 You're at work before miss Lemon? Now, that's a sign of the apocalypse.
 Time to die.
 You know what Emma? That was pretty good.
 You were trying to get me to commit suicide, right? Liddy, thank you for coming in.
 I know you have to read your books with sleepy bear in half an hour, so I'll make this brief.
 You're almost one now, and you have to understand the way the world works.
 Now, I don't know if you've seen America's kidz got singing, but it's a hit.
 Variety called it "Boffo," and they don't throw that word around lightly.
 However, there are large portions of the show that feature Jenna insulting children not much older than yourself.
 I know what you're thinking "Do you really care about the bottom line "more than the feelings of helpless innocents? That's cruel.
" Well, guess what Liddy.
 Life is cruel.
 Sometimes in business, there's collateral damage.
 And if you think I'm going to turn my back on a 10.
2/4.
2 in the demo just because I feel bad Just because those kids had the same scared look on their faces that you had when that dog got too close to your stroller in the park.
 And yes, being a parent is like wearing your heart outside your body.
 And I don't want you to know that the world is really a scary, disappointing place.
 You shouldn't have to know that, not yet.
 Oh, God.
 I have to cancel the show.
 What are you doing, Liddy? Are you touching my hand becauseyou're a baby and you're developing your fine motor skills? Or are you trying to tell me something? What are you trying to tell me? Mommy.
 Did you say "money"? Is that your first word money? Mommy.
 Yes, money.
 Are you telling me that money's more important than doing what's right? That I should keep on doing the show? I want mommy.
 I want money too! Oh, thank you, Liddy.
 Thank you for convincing me to do the right thing.
 Aw.
 Hey, think how disappointed I am.
 I mean, I'm the I'm the one who had to nude-baptize all those teens.
 Hey, buddy.
 Are you here to make fun of me, sir? Well go ahead, make fun of the super-handsome guy who believed too much.
 I don't want to make fun of you.
 I know you're disappointed.
 I just wish I had a magic wand to make it all gah! Ah, Kenneth, it's all real.
 The beast is here.
 Aah! Redire ad abyssum! Princeps tenebrarum! Ow! It's me, Lutz.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
 Stop.
 Toofer.
 Frank.
 Get out here.
 You three are in a time-out.
 Everybody in the van! Liz Lemon is a crack whore.
 Probably not, but continue.
 It's the only explanation.
 She's on a ho stroll to pay for her drug habit.
 I followed her last night, J.
D.
 She went down to Penn Station.
 And not the fun stationery store up on the Upper East Side.
 The skeezy one with trains.
 Well, there has to be some other explanation.
 Are you sure it was Liz Lemon and not present day Sally Field? I know it's crazy.
 But ever since we got back from Kwanzaa She's been acting all weird.
 All relaxed and not angry.
 Well, it has been two days, and she hasn't once stormed in here carping about how all the destructive hurricanes get female names.
 But it can't be drugs.
 Then how come I found this in her trash? Oh, Tracy, this is dexoprex.
 My mother takes it for joint pain.
 Her wrist was starting to bother her from slapping busboys.
 So it's not the Bandito Blanco? A name for cocaine I just made up? I know Liz Lemon better than she knows herself.
 Why would she need joint pain medication? And why would she be meeting people down by Tracy.
 What building is right next to Penn Station? The Manhattan center for penis enlargement? I know because my friend goes there.
 His name is Tracy.
 Madison Square Garden.
 Did you know that Lemon attended college on a partial jazz dance scholarship? And do you know what event was held last night at Madison Square Garden? A crack whore convention? No.
 Worse.
 Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the WNBA's most popular dance team, "the Timeless Torches.
" Oh, God! So much grapevining! It's so beautiful.
 A mermaid! Dude, those are diapers.
 So that's why you've been so happy and distracted lately.
 The joy of movement, exercise, with your torch card.
 And who figured the whole thing out? The man who knows me better than I know myself.
 Pull over here, please.
 This is me.
 Ah, going to the movies.
 You're going alone, to the 9:10 showing of Garry Marshall's New Year's Eve.
 You've waited five weeks to see it, to make sure that you wouldn't contribute to it being the number one movie in America.
 You'll say you're seeing it ironically, and yet you'll tear up when Ashton Kutcher kisses Lea Michele.
 You know me.
 I love it when the swarthy girl gets the guy.
 A disgusting disappointment.
 My name is Bob.
 I'm 61 years old.
 My favorite move is the shoulder shake.
 My name is Joyce.
 I'm 63 years young.
 My favorite move is the Dougie.
 I'm Liz.
 I'm 39, for the third time, and my favorite move is sunset arms.
 Hi, I'm Lewis.
 I'm a grandfather from the Dominican Republic, and my favorite move is the lift.
 Sorry, Lewis.
 Nice try, Liz.
 Dance like nobody's watchin'!   

                




                    			Liz, there's something wrong with Pete.
 Oh, my God, is he dead? I I don't know what happened.
 Kenneth, I need a light bulb replaced in my dressing room.
 Easy as pie, Ms.
 Maroney.
 What could go wrong? Why would I even say that? Hey, whatever happened to TiVo? Remember, you used to fast-forward, it'd make that sound? Boop-boop, boop-boop.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, then it'd be all like, bung-bung.
 Boop-boop, boop-boop.
 Bung-bung, bung-bung.
 Bung-bung, bung-bung.
 Boop-boop, boop-boop.
 Boop-boop, boop-boop.
 What's this? It's Terry, the gender-neutral doll I had when I was a kid.
 And he/she has his/her baseball glove and baby.
 And both sets of genitals! That was hard to track down.
 Today, almost all of them are in police evidence lockers.
 So, happy three-month anniversary, and happy two-week anniversary of you going to the bathroom when I'm here.
 You shouldn't be buying me gifts.
 You should be saving for your business.
 Oh, I think remembering our anniversary is going to get me some business.
 Aww, yeah! There's a whole other hand where that came from, big boy.
 Not my best.
 Hey, listen, why don't you go in late today, okay? I'll make pancakes with M&amp;Ms in them.
 Fine, I'll stay! Gyah.
 All right.
 Do you want a smiley face? German flag, please.
 Jordan's comments have angered gay-rights groups and are likely annoying his co-workers who thought they'd linger over breakfast this morning, perhaps with a new lover.
 Wow, that is some detailed reporting, curry.
 When I say "NBC," you say Over it! NBC! Over it! NBC! Over it! Word.
 Ugh, look at that old bag from TGS.
 Okay, I am a human being, sir.
 Oh, you mean my tote bag.
 Yes, I need a new one.
 Look, I'm sorry about Tracy.
 He really is a good person.
 Do you think I'm pulling this hat off? No.
 From the top! Over it! Oh, my God, there you are.
 We're losing sponsors, Liz.
 Did you know that snuggles the fabric softener bear is gay? He's dating the charmin cub.
 I thought they were babies.
 Unbelievable.
 Tracy, do you know how many of your hard-working and dedicated co-workers are gay? Him.
 Him.
 Her when she's drunk.
 I genuinely don't know.
 That one's a puzzler.
 And why did you have to offend the gay community? It is the most organized of all the communities.
 They make the Japanese look like the greeks.
 How is what I said offensive, and that's not? Because no one heard me say it.
 Look, I need to know what we're apologizing for, Tray.
 What did you say? Being gay is stupid.
 If you want to see a penis, take off your pants.
 If I got turned into a gay, I'd sit around all day and look at my own junk.
 Oh, my God.
 First of all, if you "got turned into a gay"? Do you think the people of Raleigh, North Carolina turned Clay Aiken gay? Why not? The Bronx turned me dyslexic.
 Look, you're a public figure, and believe it or not, the dumb things you say may influence or hurt people.
 You need to apologize.
 I already called Glad, Liz Lemon.
 Thank you for calling Glad, stronger trash bags with less plastic.
 This is Diane.
 How may I help you? Hey Diane, it's Tracy Jordan.
 Sorry about what I said.
 Well, okeydokey.
 That's the wrong "glad," Tracy.
 Whatever.
 I'm tired of apologizing all the time for just being myself.
 Remember when I offended stubborn people? That took forever to sort out.
 Well, Tracy, I know you don't want me writing an apology for you.
 That's terrific, thank you.
 Aww.
 Lemon.
 I'm on top of the Tracy thing.
 I just spoke to him Actually, I want to talk to you about something else.
 Because of my unfortunate situation with Avery, I'm alone.
 And I know, of course, that you're not seeing anyone, therefore I've decided that you and I should become friends with benefits.
 No, thank you, please.
 Aha! The only reason you would reject that offer is if you had a secret boyfriend.
 Right, that's the only reason.
 I saw you, Lemon.
 At the movies, last night, with your mouth on a man.
 Why would you keep this from me after all of our time together? This is hurtful, Elizabeth.
 What's his name? I don't want to tell you.
 Why? Is it a stupid name, like "Dakota" or "Barack"? His name is "Chris," and I'm sorry, but for my own reasons And "Chris" is spelled? No "h" and two "s"s.
 That! Right there, that's why I didn't want to tell you, because I knew you wouldn't approve of him.
 Why? What does he do for a living? Criss is trying to You can stop right there.
 He's an entrepreneur.
 He's currently meeting with investors in the hopes of starting an organic gourmet hot dog truck.
 Lemon, I have said "good God" to you before, but I don't think I've ever meant it until now.
 Good God! Where does this person live? Don't worry about it.
 How bad can it be? Jersey city? His parents' apartment? It's not a walk-up, is it? He's actually been living with me for the past month.
 Ah.
 No, I am not engaging, I am not inviting input, Jack, because Criss is different.
 How is he different? Well, that's just a stupid question.
 I mean, I'm more relaxed around him.
 My jaw stopped popping.
 Listen.
 And for once I'm not overthinking everything, which is why I don't want you in my head.
 Ah, but I'm already in your head, Lemon.
 The fact that you felt you had to keep "Chris," and I'm saying his name with an "h" and only one "s", the fact that you kept him from me simply proves that it doesn't matter whether I meet him or not.
 You already know what I would say, and you know I'm right.
 I'm ignoring you.
 You're not here.
 Who's not here, Liz? I don't know, Liz.
 I love you.
 Oh, I love you too.
 So I might as well meet him and get it over with.
 I'll probably love him.
 After all, we're both Princeton men.
 Princeton? No, Criss went to no! I am on to you.
 I am not going to talk about him.
 You can't keep me out.
 Oh, Ms.
 Maroney.
 I'm afraid I have bad news.
 Jenny McCarthy died? But who could have been slowly poisoning her? Was she poisoned? I have no way of knowing, because I'm just hearing about it.
 No, ma'am, I spoke to maintenance about replacing the light bulbs in your room, but Mr.
 Subhas is refusing to do any work for TGS until Mr.
 Jordan issues an apology for his remarks.
 He also said that he thinks, quote, "sexuality is a continuum," and he is but a voyager on a vast ocean of pleasure.
 This is unacceptable, Kenneth.
 Do you understand how important proper lighting is to an actress? Especially now that I'm officially a "B-list" celebrity, thanks to America's kids got singing.
 Oh, congratulations, Ms.
 Maroney.
 I just found out this morning, Teri Polo and Ving Rhames called me at home.
 So what if a tour came by and some Fanny pack fatty took a picture of me in my poorly-lit dressing room? And then they put the picture on the Internet? That can't happen.
 I need my special, pink-gel fluorescents, and I need them now.
 But only maintenance is allowed in the supply room.
 Kenneth, do this for me, someone I hope you consider a friend, and who in return thinks of you as sort of an albino slave-monkey.
 Aw, you think of me? Mm-hmm.
 But I don't have a key.
 You think we need a key? I guess someone's never been locked in a dog crate and thrown overboard for displeasing the sheikh.
 A statement from TGS head writer Elizabeth Lemon, adding I gotta get a real headshot.
 In other news, after lots of high financial And now, I am headed home for a "nooner," which is what I call having pancakes for lunch.
 Liz Lemon, did you just call me an idiot on this TV? Yeah, but And what exactly is that supposed to mean? It means you're someone who should know better, but you constantly do stupid things.
 How dare you! I am nonplussed, and that is the correct usage.
 You have offended and humiliated me.
 Well, maybe now you know how gay people felt when you suggested that they sit around all day and look at their own junk.
 Wait.
 Why don't they do that? Okay, you're right, L.
L.
 I do get how they felt.
 Insulted, marginalized, and outraged.
 Which is why I'm going to do exactly what they did and organize a protest of this network.
 A protest? By whom? By idiots! What an idiot.
 All right, I'm out.
 I've been dealing with Tracy all morning, and clearly this is only going to get worse.
 Time to go into Hornberger crisis mode.
 Is that when you cry on the floor in your office? Nope, I do that when I see myself in the mirror on my birthday.
 Crisis mode is when I down a couple of sleeping pills with scotch, pass out in my secret napping place, and hope I dream about that latina security guard.
 The one you always kiss on the mouth.
 That's normal in Guatemala.
 Oh.
 Picking a lock is like riding a bike.
 They're both skills you need to escape the Atlanta Falcons' equipment room.
 Hurry, Ms.
 Maroney.
 If Mr.
 Subhas finds us in here, I don't even know what he'll say, because I can't understand him.
 There! My pink fluorescents.
 They're the same lights poultry farms use to keep the birds from pecking each other to death.
 Are you as turned on as I am right now? Oh, we have to clean this up.
 "Fluorescent lights contain Mercury.
" That's poisonous.
 I'm well aware of that, Kenneth.
 I faked Mercury poisoning to get out of my contract The musical.
 "If broken, remove all people and pets from the room"? Why? Are there fumes? Are we breathing Mercury fumes right now? Kenneth.
 I'm going to tell you what I told Phil Spector.
 "It's gonna be okay, baby.
 "We just have to get some trash bags "and get back here before anyone's the wiser.
 Then we can keep recording my album.
" Oh, come on, Subhas.
 Got to keep daddy's special sleepy-place clean.
 Hey, so check this out.
 I think I saw Billy Dee Williams in riverside park this morning when I was meeting dogs.
 Now that seems like a good use of time for a busy entrepreneur.
 Hello, Lemon.
 Chew with your mouth closed.
 So, question about Lando Calrissian Is that an Armenian name? Is he a space Armenian? I don't know.
 The Kardashians are Armenian, they're into black guys, so there's something to it I like how his voice goes up at the ends of sentences.
 That's very masculine.
 Oh, my.
 Is that a tan line on Criss' thumb? Did Criss used to wear a thumb ring? Oh, better hold on to this one.
 He's getting a free muffin soon.
 Wow, I've never seen a sunglass hut credit card before.
 Oh, a ukulele with an Obama sticker on it.
 Hmm.
 this guy might suck That was a gift from Criss' kickball team.
 Well, I think I've seen enough.
 Which totally supports your theory that the phillie phanatic is biologically a female.
 Oh, yeah, if you watch those games, that thing definitely has a menstrual cycle.
 Right? You gonna put on pants today? Eh.
 I'm in your head.
 We're here, we're proud, I came up with this rhyme! You brought this on yourself, Liz Lemon.
 The so-called idiot community will not be silenced.
 For God's sake, Tracy.
 We are legion.
 We are America.
 Frat guys, DJs, loud-mouthed old bitches, investment bankers, the tramp-stamped, parrot-heads, anti-vaccination crusaders, and people who won't shut up about scuba diving.
 It's a whole other world down there.
 And our celebrity spokesperson, actress Denise Richards.
 That's right.
 I'm an idiot.
 Surprised? Well, I am.
 For all "intensive purposes.
" Our community is mobilized now, L.
L.
 And we're not leaving until we're heard.
 You can't ignore us, Liz Lemon.
 We will be out here every day, misremembering movie quotes.
 Because as Braveheart said, "you can take our freedom, unless you take our lives.
" Say you approve of Criss, Jack.
 Am I in your head, Lemon? Yes, but don't be so proud.
 I also have a lot of imaginary arguments with the couples on house hunters.
 Why can't people look past paint color? Lemon, obviously I can't approve of someone I've never met.
 Yeah, well, I'm not letting you meet Criss, because you won't approve of him.
 Well, then I guess this is a catch-22.
 Although I don't know for sure, because I refuse to read literature that questions the morality of war.
 Look, clearly I hurt your feelings.
 You're upset that I didn't tell you about Criss.
 No, no, no, I'm quite over your subterfuge, although I do expect a note of apology.
 And don't try to make it funny.
 Just apologize.
 But I feel like people expect comedy They don't.
 It's exhausting.
 However, you're right that I am having an emotional reaction.
 It's very frustrating to watch someone I care about do something she clearly knows is bad for her, like that week you wore those blue contact lenses.
 I looked like Adriana Lima.
 And you don't know that Criss is bad for me, and you never will.
 So you better get on board the Criss train.
 Criss-a, Criss, Criss, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss-a, Criss train! Do you have any water? You know what, Lemon? Fine.
 You are technically an adult.
 You can do whatever you want.
 Really? So I won? With the train thing? I won't ask any questions about Criss again.
 You promise? Promise.
 With two "s"s.
 I would, however, like to ask you why Tracy is outside cursing this network on a megaphone.
 It's a good one, Jack.
 Tracy has organized a protest of NBC by his fellow idiots.
 He what? No, no, no, no, no.
 We need idiots.
 You certainly need idiots.
 Who do you think is watching your show? Funky taste-makers? Black nerds, jet blue passengers who fall asleep with the TV on, pets whose owners have died, and, uh, idiots.
 You need to fix this.
 I don't know what to say to those people.
 You wrote "remember to DVR Kendra" on your hand.
 I think you can handle it.
 Ah, no, damn it.
 Now I gotta pray for a marathon.
 Jiminy Cricket, copyright Walt Disney company, 1940! Mr.
 Hornberger? Sir? Pete! It's Jenna! The woman you're in love with! What's wrong with him? Is this because of the Mercury? What does the box say? "For a complete catalog of our lighting products, visit our website.
" We need a computer.
 Poor Mr.
 Hornberger.
 He came in here to do something for the show, something important, and now look what we've done.
 What you've done.
 You broke the lights.
 We have to get help.
 Are you out of your mind? We need to call security, and an ambulance.
 Think, you fool.
 Imagine what the Internet would do with this.
 "Maroney found in closet with unconscious married man and inbred virgin.
" Again? No way.
 I have too much to lose now.
 I am this close to becoming the spokeswoman for the vaginal mesh industry.
 Vaginal mesh.
 Nice try, prolapse.
 Now, if you want to take the fall for this, be my guest.
 But I can't be connected to it in any way.
 Take what fall? Oh, please.
 You said it yourself how many rules we've broken.
 "B" and "E", theft and destruction of company property.
 And who knows what we've done to Pete.
 If anyone connects you to this I'll get fired.
 They'd kick me out of the page program faster than a fella can come up with folksy similes.
 No one can know this was our fault.
 But we have to help Mr.
 Hornberger.
 What do we do? I don't know.
 But I know someone who does.
 Talk to me.
 I'm on my way.
 Any idea what bus I take to get there? 'Cause I'm in Chinatown, baby.
 Hi, this is Tracy's cell phone.
 Dot com, hold the steering wheel.
 I've got to leave my outgoing message.
 What did I just hit? Was that a person? Is that paint or blood? Dot com, this did not happen.
 We take this to our graves! Tracy, uh, this is Liz.
 Please call my office.
 My extension, as you have pointed out, spells "anus" with an "I".
 Hey, what's up? What time you coming home? Because I'm taking you out to dinner What? I called sunglass hut and got my credit limit raised to $80, plus, they told me I only needed to get free lens wipes, and I haven't even gotten to the good news yet.
 That's all awesome.
 What happened? I got an investor for the truck.
 I went over my whole business plan, guy gave me ten grand.
 Oh, my God.
 Okay, if you got it in cash, we can spread the money out on the bed and kiss on top of it.
 But nothing more.
 And I have a cold sore.
 Damn it.
 No, it's a check.
 But look at it.
 It's beautiful.
 It's him.
 Not cool.
  Who's that man behind the curtain   His kiss will make you certain   of the one name you'll be blurtin'   during love-making  Kelsey, Kelsey  one touch and you're not caring   how much you paid repairing  that China hutch that you kicked down the stairs   during love-making  thanks to Kelsey, his name is Kelsey   his friends call him Kelsey   or sometimes just "Kels"  his name is Kelsey, he's very wealthy   he doesn't have to be doing this   Kelsey   

                




                    			Previously on "30 Rock".
 Say you approve of Criss.
 I'm in your head.
 Why did you have to offend the gay community? Did you just call me an idiot on this TV? Tracy has organized a protest of NBC by his fellow idiots.
 Mr.
 Hornberger? What do we do? I don't know.
 But I know someone who does.
 Talk to me.
 They're still mad? We sent Elton and David a honey-baked ham.
 What more do they want? I'm joined now by one gay rights advocate who isn't sure Jordan and NBC have learned their lesson.
 Devin Banks, welcome.
 Thank you, Dallas.
 I have seen you since Michael Kors' new year's Eve masquerade.
 Uh, I don't know what you're talking about.
 Right.
 Let's dive in.
 Banks.
 Hey, try this.
 New recipe.
 We have to talk.
 How fresh is that dog? Yesterday, that was the face, feet and colon of a pig.
 I'm so fired up, Liz.
 I got some cash now.
 I can finally make a down payment on a real food truck.
 Yeah, the van's not great.
 All right, kids.
 Who wants some? Get in my van.
 Is there a problem, officer? But you can't take that money.
 What, why not? Because the guy who wrote you the check He's my boss and he doesn't really care about the hot dog truck or locally sourced pig sweepings.
 He just needed an excuse to meet you.
 Wait a minute, you know Jack? Why would he want to pay $10,000 to meet me? Because I didn't want him to meet you.
 He inserts himself into my business whether I want him to or not and now he's inserting himself into this.
 Well, that's what she said, but Why wouldn't you want him to meet me? You're embarrassed of me? No, it's not me, it's him.
 I didn't want him to lecture me about how you don't have a job and your name is spelled wrong and you went to Wesleyan.
 Wesleyan is the Harvard of central Connecticut.
 Yale is the Harvard of central Connecticut.
 Had that locked and loaded, didn't you? Well, you know what? This isn't a Jack problem.
 I think this is a Liz problem.
 Because you wouldn't care what he thought unless you agreed with him.
 Like you're so perfect.
 Let's not do this.
 You don't say cholesterol correctly.
 "Chloresterole.
" You're a 41 year old woman who cheats at board games.
 You don't use the tab closures on cereal boxes.
 If you think those are doing anything to seal in freshness, you are living in a fantasy world, pal.
 Forget it.
 This was a good day, Liz.
 I'm gonna be in the park meditating.
 What would Jack say about that? He'd say, "good God, Lemon.
" Locked and loaded.
 Good God, Lemon.
 Ep 03 Idiots Are People Three  I'll have you know the last man who wore jeans in this office was named Theodore Wrangler.
 And you, Banks, could not even carry his trademark, floor-length, suede cape.
 I was wondering when I'd hear from you, Jack.
 Do you know what comes up on my phone when you call? Where did you get that? The only copy of that photograph is in Stephanie Seymour's safety deposit box.
 You have bigger things to worry about, Jack.
 See, I've got you right where I want you.
 Really? You think you have leverage here? The news cycle is done with Tracy.
 They've moved on to a story about teenagers huffing other teenagers.
 Tracy's apologies have been accepted by GLAAD and I don't even know what organization you're here representing.
 We're new, we're called PEEN.
 And what is that an acronym for? Acronym? Okay, you've succeeded in annoying me and wasting my time.
 But your 15 minutes is up.
 Andyou've got nothing.
 Really? Nothing? See that little Tracy Jordan gem that I leaked last night was just the tip of the iceberg, Jack.
 And NBC is the Titanic.
 The highest grossing movie of all time! The boat, not the movie, the boat! See, I've been following Tracy's standup act for months now and if any of this gets out, every protected group in America's gonna be picketing this network.
 Enjoy.
 Good God.
 Oh, is this one about how asians act on the subway? I know, I almost threw up the first time I heard it.
 Oh, this one's fun.
 Starts out as a joke about our first Mexican President.
 My Lord.
 And ends up as just a rant against women.
 Oh No one can ever listen to this.
 Then she had teeth down there! What do you want, money? A job? This isn't a business play, Jack.
 I mean, what's the point.
 After going head to head with you for the last five years, I've ended up as a house husband in Brooklyn.
 You won, Jack.
 So what are you saying? I've given up trying to beat you in the board room.
 But there are still things I can make you do.
 All right, you can watch me shower, but no touching.
 No touching just makes it hotter.
 No, I'm after bigger game than you.
 See you're a very influential man, Donaghy.
 You can pull strings in the kind of venerable institutions that still reject creeps like me.
 I want you to get my triplets into preschool At St.
 Matthew's.
 Banks, that's impossible.
 Just last year, they rejected one of St.
 Matthew's actual descendents.
 I know.
 I head that during her interview she turned the class hamster into a dove.
 Good luck.
 Pick up the Mercury with the tape, bag it, then seal the bags.
 We'll drive everything out to the meadowlands and roll the car into a swamp.
 We should take two cars.
 You didn't tell me he was alive! Well of course he is.
 Pete's our friend, Kelsey.
 Damn it! No names! We don't want him to die.
 But more importantly, we don't want to be blamed for what's happened to him.
 It's been five hours since he's pressed an elevator button.
 His office is on this floor, isn't it? Yes, but to get him there, you have to go through the backstage and the backstage is full of people.
 We need a distraction.
 Something to clear the halls of TGS.
 How much time will Kenneth and I have? How long is the show? I don't know.
 I've never done it before, baby.
 I will make a brief statement on behalf of the idiot community, then I will open the floor for questions.
 Since its founding early this afternoon, the national association for zero intolerance, or Nazi We should change that.
 It's fine.
 We are outraged that the American bigot, Liz Lemon, has made no effort to reach out to us.
 Tracy, are you kidding me? I have been calling your cell all day.
 My ringtone is the chicken dance.
 If I answer it, I won't hear the whole song! I have to go talk to Jack right now.
 Wait for me in my office.
 Is there anything you would like to add? These microphones look like black ice cream cones.
 Thank you all for coming out.
 Jack, I am giving you your money back.
 You can't tear up my checks, Criss.
 They're printed on Nixon's old bed sheets.
 Look, I don't understand your relationship with Liz.
 She's my subordifriend.
 Well, she's my girlfriend and I'm not gonna let you get in between us.
 It's a little late for that.
 You're not going to want to hear this, but I am officially disapproving of you.
 Well, I'm sorry, but I really don't care what you think.
 That's really not how things work around here, Criss.
 Damn it, Criss, stop talking to him, it's a trap! You said I won.
 You said you wouldn't ask any more questions about Criss.
 I said I wouldn't ask you any more questions.
 Semantics! You had no right to come to my home to trick Criss to rearrange my bathroom.
 For the better.
 Yes.
 The basket of shells was a nice touch.
 But, I'm afraid I have bad news.
 I just told Criss that I am officially disapproving.
 Oh, no.
 Who cares? Of course, you're free to make your own decisions, Lemon.
 You can either pretend that you and I are not in agreement and continue this, uh charade.
 Or you can part ways with Criss now and go and find someone who will truly make you happy.
 I'm sorry, is this guy breaking up with me? Of course, you and Criss can still be friends.
 Okay, Liz, I guess you got a choice to make.
 You can listen to Jack, we can call it quits and I go back to sleeping on the floor of my Uncle's mattress store, or You don't understand.
 He's in my head.
 Okay, forget Jack.
 What does Liz think, hmm? What do you want? Do you want to be with me or not? Don't look at me, ask her.
 I don't know, Liz.
 It's gonna go wrong eventually, right? I mean, I like him, but, what are we doing here? Really? This is how you see yourself? Of course I pick you, Criss.
 If you would just address some of the issues that we as a group have been talking about.
 Unbelievable.
 Well, I have to go get a bunch of gaybies into preschool before we all get sued, so, uh Well done, Lemon.
 So, then he says "Tiff down there" Good one, Jack.
 I'll tell you, friendship is the one kind of ship that never sinks.
 Douglas, so good to see you.
 Uh, do you know my friend, Devin Banks? A friend of Donaghy's, eh? I'll watch my wallet.
 Yes, yes, very good, Douglas.
 Very funny.
 So now we're all good friends and good friends do favors for each other.
 Is that a St.
 Matthew's tie? I didn't know you went there.
 Not only did I go there, I happen to be President of the board.
 Although, during my financial report I may be President of the bored.
 St.
 Matthew's is such a wonderful school.
 We were just talking about that.
 In fact, Devin's triplets are applying to St.
 Matthew's right now.
 I see Splendid.
 On a totally unrelated topic, did you know that I'm also on the board of the Manhattan hospital for rich whites and assimilated Jews? I did not know that.
 Unfortunately, shortly before Don Geiss died, the Geiss foundation made a sizeable pledge to the hospital.
 A pledge which, sadly, has not been fulfilled.
 What a coincidence because Devin and I happen to know the new chair of the Geiss foundation quite well.
 That is a coincidence.
 Kathy, are you ready to come out now? There she is.
 Hey, you.
 Hey, funny.
 Kathy, I know this is a lot to take in but, your father made a promise to my friend, so, what can we do to get that check right now? And that's why I'm so thrilled to introduce NBC's new mascot, Magellica the Unicorn.
 It's wondrous.
 Indeed.
 Back to you, Thomas.
 Okaywe now return to our coverage of that train derailment in California.
 And idiots can do anything we put our minds to.
 I played a "nucular" psychiatrist in a James "Bong" movie.
 Look, what do I need to do to make this go away? I want you to call my phone so I can hear the chicken dance again.
 And I want the video for my new single to play on TGS this week.
  La piscine  j'adore la piscine  towels sunscreen bathing suits   diving boards and towels  those ladders  towels Can you make it We're short this week.
 I'll try to cut it down.
 But above all, we want you to recognize who we are as a community.
 Idiots aren't just strippers or stay at home moms.
 Idiots are all around us.
 I couldn't find a Lincoln hat so I grabbed this chimney sweep hat instead.
 If anyone notices We're dead.
 So it would mean a lot if you apologized publically, Liz Lemon.
 Let the healing begin.
 And since you wrote my apology, we went on ahead and wrote yours.
 Careful.
 Careful.
 Who designed your bathroom? It's exquisite.
 I did, you son of a bitch.
 I'm excellent at rearranging bathrooms.
 Now get out of here, you got what you wanted.
 I just wanted to say thank you, Jack.
 Very impressive.
 Can't imagine that your boss, Hank Cooper, was all that happy about the logo change.
 Eh, we'll see.
 Our new slogan, "NBC, we have a magical horse?" Is testing, uhOkay.
 Oh, I also wanted to say that I was lying when I said that this wasn't a business play.
 Banks, you're out of the game.
 That's true.
 And I've admitted defeat.
 For our generation.
 But for the next generation? Well, thanks to you, the Banks boys are way ahead.
 All the favors that you called in, you would have used next year for little lippy.
 Liddy.
 Is that even a name? In Brooklyn, I know, like, six lippys Doesn't matter.
 You just mortgaged your daughter's future to get out of a little jam at work.
 My mommy and me group would really judge your parenting.
 Especially lippy's mother.
 Which lippy? Lippy D.
 Oh, God, Liddy might have to go to public school.
 See you in 30 years, Jack.
 I wonder what Liddy will be doing with her degree from suny.
 Don't even say it.
 Oneonta.
 You, jacket.
 Well, hello there, welcome to the White House.
 Four score and seven years ago What's with that hat? Oh, I think it looks very authentic.
 Yeah, I guess you're right.
 Mary Todd, you say? Wha what's happening? Shh, Pete, don't talk.
 Wassup?! Yeah, baby! I'm here today to apologize for my earlier comments.
 I used an offensive term to describe a group of people who made America the great continent that it is today.
 Yeah! These kickass people have given the world countless bodacious things like the birther movement, intelligent design Water parks no, I will not endorse water parks.
 They are a cesspool of disease and people boo you when you walk back down the stairs.
 You know what you people have given the world? Girls gone wild.
 The Golden Globes, cans that tell you how cold beer is, Florida, bratz dolls.
 Oh, I get it.
 She's naming awesome things.
 No, listen to me.
 Because of you, there may be an entouragemovie.
 Hug it off, ma'am! Turtle, turtle, turtle! You know what, I give up.
 You should know better, but no.
 You're just gonna keep on riding motorcycles, having unprotected sex and voting against free health care.
 You will make the same self-destructive decisions over and over and you will never really be happy.
 And your jaw will hurt all the time.
 Oh, look at you.
 Perfect little weiner dog, you just need a little mustard on you like that.
 And a little bun, just boop, like that.
 No one will make you deutschepancakes, or welcome you home smelling of hot dog water and onion, or let you break out of jail when you play monopoly.
 Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot.
 Wanna make out? No, thank you.
 Hot crowd, hot crowd.
 We've only got a minute before I have to get back out there.
 Act two is a play within a play.
 It's funny, in school all you learn about Abraham Lincoln is that he was a gay alcoholic.
 Grab his feet.
 Kelsey Gram Shh, shh, shh.
 There, there, there you go.
 Okay, okay.
 I've gotta get back into character.
 Hit me in the face! What I forgot to press a floor again.
 Hey, what's up, Jackie d? In a lot of ways, you and I had similar upbringings.
 Terrible schools, broken homes Thinking basketball was the ticket out.
 Being wrong.
 At some point, our paths diverged.
 I went on to Princeton, business school, ge and beyond.
 And look at me.
 I spent all day creating a movement just to get back at Liz Lemon.
 I said creating a movement.
 The point is that excellence can come from anywhere.
 It's the same with stupidity.
 In this country, anyone could be the next Jack Donaghy or the next Denise Richards.
 This room Is moving.
 Oh, God.
 Banks.
 What are you still doing here? Well, my husband was supposed to pick me up at 6:00 but he can be such an idiot.
 I'm sure he can.
 Where did you go to school, Devin? I had the best education in the world.
 Private kindergarten where I got straight check marks.
 Experimental boarding school in carmel where the students teach the teachers, and the teachers teach animals.
 Year abroad on an all-male catamaran.
 Then on to Northwestern where I majored in confidence.
 I had every educational advantage, Jack.
 Just like my children will.
 But I beat you.
 What? I beat you.
 I came from nothing.
 But I caught up and I crushed you.
 Just like Liddy's gonna crush your sons.
 She's already sorting objects by shape and color.
 At 11 months, I don't think so.
 She can count to ten if you say seven for her.
 She gets five and nine? She can save five words.
 So.
 In mandarin.
 They've put her with the toddlers at her singing and clapping class at fun factory.
 She's in Orange group? She's already out of the piaget sensorimotor stage.
 That's impossible.
 She scored a 62 on the object permanence matrix.
 But that's an adult score.
 And did I mention She's using the potty.
 Surely just for wee-wee.
 No.
 See you in 30 years, Banks.
 It's already, like, turning itself.
 But I feel like I still have to turn it.
 Oh, oh, my God, mustard just came out my nose.
 Oh, it's burning the backs of my eyes.
 All right, I gotta go back to work, bye.
 Okay, all right.
 Ah, it's burning my face now.
 All right, I'm putting you on probationary approval.
 Okay, I don't really care.
 I'll tell you what changed my mind, Criss: a conversation I had with Tracy Jordan.
 You see, greatness can come from anywhere.
 So if a poor boy from Boston can become me, maybe you could become a suitable sex partner for Liz Lemon.
 You've got three months.
 But your opinion doesn't matter.
 You have no say in this.
 Liz, there's something wrong with Pete.
 Oh, my God! I don't know what happened.
 Pete, I have been out there putting out fires all day while you've been hiding in here doing this? You're disgusting.
 No, no, I was I didn't I Kelsey Grammer! Kelsey Grammer did this to me.
 Really, Pete? Kelsey Grammer made you do this while he was performing his one man show about Abraham Lincoln? Ugh.
 Here's to another successful operation by The best friends gang.
 Hang on.
 I didn't notice before with all the excitement, but I look incredibly beautiful.
 The lighting is back to normal.
 Both switches need to be on, woman.
 The bulb wasn't even broken? None of this was necessary.
  I know I've been successfully assassinated.
 But I have one last thing to tell my country.
 Blackbeard's gold is buried in I am a ghost now, Leaving behind my earthly possessions.
 And although I left my country divided by war, A civil war So that's where that name came from.
 I know that future generations will forge a stronger country And that some day, America will be a place Where everybody knows your name.
   

                




                    			From the director of Valentine's day and New Year's Eve What? Tomorrow is Martin Luther king day? Yeah, and neither of us have dates.
 Too bad we're just platonic friends.
 I have a right to love you.
 Hello.
 In the words of Martin Luther King, I've just got to go for it.
 You're a white supremacist? You guys can just do the fun stuff.
 Oh, my God.
 All I want is one extraordinary moment.
 Sounds like you have a dream.
 It's Martin Luther King day.
 So, I need you to promote that TGS.
 No, I'm not promoting that garbage on the show.
 Oh, Liz.
 This isn't a request, this is an order.
 I've already spoken to Jack about it.
 Wow.
 Well, now I'm going to speak to Jack about it.
 The rest of you, keep working Lemon, I'm sorry, but Jenna has become a huge star for this network.
 She's bigger than Maulik Pancholy on Whitney.
 Look, I put up with a lot from Jenna.
 A couple months ago, she cut off my ponytail because she was jealous of the attention that I was getting, on my own birthday.
 But this is new, going to you behind my back? You can't reward her for that.
 My hands are tied.
 But, and I will, heh, never say this again, you have a power that I don't.
 Besides the greatest power of all? The ability to gestate life.
 Of course, Lemon.
 That's why the President is always a new mom.
 I was referring to your unique leverage with Jenna: Your friendship.
 No, I like to keep "boss Liz" and "friend Liz" separate, because "boss Liz" is all "paperwork, paperwork," but "friend Liz" is all "my feet hurt, I'm staying in tonight.
" Lemon, I've decided to eliminate the NBC page program.
 What? I was in Washington yesterday reviewing satellite images of Avery in North Korea.
 For what it's worth, CIA analysts have confirmed that she is, indeed, "keeping it tight.
" I don't know how this is about my problem, but I trust you.
 I'm getting there.
 While I was in Washington, I learned the house shut down its page program.
 With texting and email, a multi-million dollar system of pleasure slaves is no longer needed.
 Hang on, we need the pages.
 Especially Kenneth.
 He, uh well, he, uh He always scratches that weird part of my back that I can't reach.
 Unless Oh! That's the business! Now who's in charge, winter dryness? I'm hoping that a bold, cost-cutting move like this will impress Hank Hooper.
 But I've only worked for Hank for a year.
 He's still difficult to read, much like that memoir Reagan wrote the week before he died.
 It's, uhscattered.
 Well, now I think we're just talking about your thing.
 You tricked me.
 You know how to read Jenna.
 Use your power.
 Oh, damn it.
 I need some tape! Ep.
 04 The Ballad of Kenneth Parcell  Hey, Tray.
 We just picked up your birthday party invitations from the printer.
 Wait! What is this? "Give to charity please, no presents"? Yeah, that's what you told me to put on the card.
 No, Dotcom! I said, "give to charity? Please, no.
 Presents!" Well, I'm sorry, but you don't really need presents.
 You already have everything.
 I mean, you just bought Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's bones, and he's not even dead.
 Wow.
 Maybe I do have everything.
 But what does that say about me? I need time alone, guys, to think About mortality.
 Hey, buddy.
 I thought maybe we could have a little talk, girl to girl.
 Mm, sure.
 I love light chitchat.
 Did you hear about how my fecalist murdered my kabbalist? Wow.
 Look, we're inside, you can take off the sunglasses.
 Oh.
 What are those? Leeches.
 They're good for your skin, and I've lost tons of blood weight.
 Oh, my God! Okay, remember the pact we made back in Chicago? Liz, if I become famous, will you tell me if I start acting weird? Definitely.
 And will you do the same for me? You? Famous? That's hilarious.
 Well, I'm invoking the pact.
 You're putting leeches on your face.
 Demi Moore does it.
 Plus, it makes P.
E.
T.
A.
 furious, and if P.
E.
T.
A.
 doesn't love you or hate you, you're a nobody, like a soldier, or a teacher.
 Jenna, take off the leeches! I feel like I'm losing you.
 I mean, we used to get lunch every week.
 When was the last time we did that? You know, with my fecalist in jail, I can eat whatever I want today.
 Maybe we could go to outback I'm going to call ahead and make sure we're in Darryl's section.
 Who am I? What does it all mean? Will I ever truly be happy? Tray, I hate seeing you like this.
 Sitting in here listening to your depressed thoughts CD.
 What is the meaning of  You remember Celia's bakery in the Bronx? It was on the corner of Malcolm X Boulevard and guy who shot Malcolm X Boulevard.
 When I was a kid, I wanted one of those pies so bad.
 So I swore to myself that one day I would become so rich I would buy every single pie in Celia's.
 I wanted for nothing as a child, but that brings its own challenges.
 Shut up, Dotcom.
 And now look at that kid, he turned into an incredibly fit genius who has everything he ever wanted.
 So if there's no more to want, what's the point in living? Whoa, hang on, Tray.
 You've got a family.
 Great, another thing that I've already got.
 Thanks for making this situation worse.
 Should we get another one? If you eat four, you get a T-shirt.
 So one more, and that's two T-shirts.
 Oh, no, they're here.
 And you don't want the paparazzi taking pictures of you? Not when I'm just trying to have lunch with my best friend like a normal person.
 It's like I'm in a cage.
 And not the fun kind where you dance while U.
S.
C.
 football recruits throw hot coins at you.
 I'm sorry, do you want to sneak out the back? They'd be expecting that.
 Would you like a chance to be famous, Liz? Naturally.
 Always.
 I'm from Tampa, Florida.
 Leech abuser! Nice try, P.
E.
T.
A.
 bitches.
 But I saw you hiding in the crowd.
 You just threw paint on a nobody, who can't even sing Make sure you get the outback sign in the shot or I don't get paid.
 Taxi! I have good news, and I have bad news.
 The bad news is, I am shutting down the page program.
 The good news is for a different group of people.
 Uh, as the most popular page, I feel I should say something.
 Kenneth, please.
 Everyone knows that Dalton is the most popular page.
 Dalton! Dalton! Dalton! Fine, but, you can't cancel the page program.
 Who will take messages or seat audiences or order lunch? Today, all of those tasks can be managed electronically.
 You're just going to automate us? Excuse me, sir, but this reminds me of the tale of John Henry.
 Now, gather 'round friends and We all know about John Henry, Kenneth.
 It's just a story.
 Well then, I know about another story that turned out to be true.
 It's about a virgin who gave birth to a man who had some funny ideas.
 That virgin was my sister.
 And her son, Lyle, has a learning disability.
 Security will escort you out.
 And these uniforms are still the property of NBC, and we'll need them back.
 You are insane! You knew that P.
E.
T.
A.
 guy was there.
 Look, I'm sorry, I couldn't be photographed with paint on me.
 I'd look like you do right now.
 That is psychopath behavior.
 How did I ever even become friends with someone like you? If I remember correctly, Elizabeth, we became friends because I felt bad for you, standing alone at that party like a loser.
 Yeah, 'cause I really wanted to talk to the girl who was wrestling in a kiddie pool full of lube.
 Well, what were you even doing at that bachelor party? Derek thought I was a guy, and I didn't want to ruin what was happening between us.
 God, I wish my first roommate hadn't died of old age.
 Then you wouldn't have moved in, and I wouldn't have wasted to make you feel better about yourself.
 'Cause guess what? The back of your neck does look weird.
 Why would you say that? You know I can't see it.
 Oh, forget it.
 I don't need you, Liz.
 I have real friends now, celebrity friends who understand what I'm going through.
 You see? Charlie from Charlie bit my finger and Knob Kardashian just texted me.
 They're my new besties.
 Well, I don't need you either.
 I've got a new bestie too, and her name is something cool, like Sam, and she does web design, maybe, and I haven't met her yet.
 Look out, New York, Liz Lemon is 41, covered in paint, and looking for a new best friend.
 Kenneth, you're a hard worker, and I will find you something else here at the company.
 Not interested, sir.
 I don't want to work for an organization that would throw away a tradition like the page program.
 Think of all the famous people who started as pages: Steve Allen, Regis Philbin, Ted Bundy, Richard Ramirez, John Wayne gacy Kenneth, I'm sorry.
 But progress means eliminating useless institutions.
 Well, Mr.
 Donaghy, there's one thing you haven't thought of.
 Who will give the NBC tours? No machine can repla We're calling it "notkenneth.
" It's hard not to take that personally, sir.
 We've inputted the entire page handbook into notkenneth's database.
 It knows everything you know, and more.
 Why, Jack, why? "Why Jack why?" is a 2002 episode of Will and Grace, in which Jack, Sean Hayes, chooses between two YMCAs.
 Featuring guest stars Daniel Day-Lewis as gay benchpress guy.
 Hey, Sue.
 What are you up to tonight? I'm not working late again.
 Why don't you write the show yourself? You take all the credit anyway.
 I hope you dream of your death.
 I was just wondering if you wanted to go to a movie? Oh.
 I can't.
 I have to work late.
 Hey, Hank.
 I didn't think I was going to see you until dinner tonight.
 Whatever.
 I don't even know if I'm coming.
 Hank, is something wrong? Jack, I bought this company a year ago today.
 Now, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but where I come from, anniversaries mean something.
 Hank, of course I remembered our "businessversary.
" I sent a gift.
 Oh, really? Was it invisible? Sorry.
 I drove all the way up here from Philadelphia listening to Garrison Keillor and just getting psyched for a fun day.
 I used our new messenger system and sent the gift to your office on the 60th floor.
 Ah, it didn't go to 60, it went to 6.
 What's on 6? Oh, no! Hey, how does an adult make new friends? I don't have time for this.
 Hank Hooper's businessversary gift went to TGS.
 TGSis a sketch show known for popular characters like Error.
 Error.
 Error.
 Error.
 Stop! Nerds, stop.
 Stop what you are doing immediately.
 Toofer, put that glass down.
 That scotch fountain obviously was not meant for you.
 Phillie phanatic, get away from him.
 None of this was meant for you.
 That should have been obvious, since a gift from me would suggest that you were producing good work.
 You are not.
 Lance Ito, you're out of order.
 Line! This was meant to go to the 60th floor.
 It's not their fault.
 It says 6th floor on the invoice.
 Must be a computer error.
 Well, somebody made a mistake.
 A dumb mistake.
 And it wasn't the pages, and it wasn't the computer Ha! It was Jack! Guys, Jack makes dumb mistakes.
 He's just like us.
 He's no better than I am.
 He's just got a suit.
 No, no, I am better than you, Lutz.
 Someone else is to blame, and I will find him or, more likely, her.
 He looks scared, like Lutz on an escalator.
 Twinsies! I called the paps earlier, and they sent Lester.
 No one ever uses him.
 Ugh.
 I'd like to bite his finger.
 Charlie.
 Sweetie, you look amazing.
 Knob Kardashian, Charlie bit my finger, this is mankind.
 And this, is Mr.
 Socko.
 Oh, I know Mr.
 Socko.
 Honey, I don't think that was Madame Bovary, I think it was Madame Ovary.
 Oh, no, you went there.
 Man, do my feet hurt in heels sometimes, and other things that women talk about.
 Can we help you? Sorry, I'm just trying to make a new best friend.
 Oh, sweetie, honey, oh.
 Yeah, it's really hard.
 I mean, how did you guys meet each other? We were at karaoke, and we all picked the same song.
 And then when the song came up, we all went on stage.
 And everybody was like, "what?" And then we were like, What you want? Baby, I got it  Shut up! That's horrible.
 But I get your point.
 I need to go somewhere where someone like me would be hanging out.
 But where does Liz Lemon go when she's out on the town? To the Barnes &amp; Noble bathroom.
 Occupied! God.
 I know it is.
 By my new best friend.
 Hey there, Jack.
 That Jenna Maroney sure is a hoot.
 I didn't care for Mr.
 Socko.
 In my day, socks just kept their mouth shut.
 Well, Hank, you'll be interested to know I'm getting to the bottom of our little gift mix-up earlier.
 Really, Jack? There's a problem with the computer system where it confuses 6 and 60? I don't like your tone, Rossitano.
 Aw, it's okay.
 You messed up, buddy.
 Lutz, don't touch me.
 Hang on, Jack.
 Are these two very ill children saying you messed up the delivery? That's unacceptable.
 Hey, we all make mistakes.
 Like farting when you're talking to three people.
 No, a mistake is something a man does, like going to war without a reason, or executing a simpleton.
 What Jack did is a "whoopsie-daisy," like a baby or a woman would do.
 No, no, Hank.
 It wasn't me, it was the machines.
 Tell him it wasn't my fault.
 My fault, a short-lived NBC game show in which homeless people won money by confessing to crimes they didn't commit.
 Damn you.
 Dam you.
A beaver goes to college in this 1987 anima Okay, who wants to see the red band trailer of Martin Luther King day? No, we need to decide which cell phone pictures I'm going to leak.
 Everyone, listen to Charlie bit my finger's new song.
 I'm rotten to the core mother Quiet! Mankind is trying to tweet about these clowns in Congress.
 Excuse me, guys.
 We're not doing your things, we're doing my me things.
 You mean me, right? Me.
 Me? You're all using that word wrong.
 I'm me.
 I'm me.
 Uhh! I hate it when they put the movie poster on the cover of the book that the movie is based on.
 Let me imagine what Peeta Mellark looks like, and how his arms smell of bread.
 Amy, this is great.
 We are going to be best friends.
 Where should we get dinner? I don't trust Sushi, Mexican gives me gas, and I already had a bloomin' onion today.
 Me too.
 Also, Ethiopian is out, because I don't want to see a man with a beard eat with his hands.
 And nothing family style.
 Ah! Why is family a selling point? Look at the state of the American family.
 Not something we'll ever have to worry about at our age.
 I saw a headline about those amoebas that eat your brain, but I didn't read the article.
 Well, you didn't have time.
 Our lives are half-over.
 Our mothers lied to us.
 Hey, you can't ride a bike on the sidewalk.
 Oh, my God, I am starving.
 We have been wandering around for Oh, brother.
 Hanging out with me is awful.
 Amy, we can't both be the negative, judgmental one.
 So what? I'm just supposed to sit around and listen to you complain? No.
 You're supposed to be so vacant and self-absorbed that you just let me vent without piling on.
 I need Jenna.
 I need Steffi.
 They say people who kill themselves never regret it.
 Tracy.
 Tracy, stop.
 I found something for you to live for.
 I already have a room full of old black women.
 No, Tray, this is Celia Monroe, from Celia's bakery.
 She lives in a nursing home on Long Island now.
 We're all sleeping with Carl, because he has the most puzzles.
 But we tracked her down, and she baked you a banana cream pie, see? That's something you didn't have.
 So that means there must be other things I don't have.
 Other reasons to live.
 You guys must have went through a lot of trouble to show me that.
 You must have been upset.
 And I know how that feels, because I've been upset.
 I was very upset when you put "no presents" on my birthday invitations.
 That's what this was about? Why didn't you just tell us back in your dressing room? Because showing is better than telling, and my schedule is light this week.
 Thank you.
 I never should have treated you the way I did, Liz.
 I need someone who has so little going on in their life, she lets me get all the attention.
 And I need someone in my life who doesn't listen to a word I say.
 Thank you, I just got it cut.
 I was wrong.
 I do need you.
 You had me at "I was wrong, I do need.
" I can replace just about everything you do, but no machine could ever be the human wastebasket that I dump my stupid mistakes into.
 Dump, sir.
 Dump all over me.
 You thumb with a wig, those gifts were supposed to go to the 60th floor.
 I'm sorry, sir.
 It was all my fault.
 Good job, Jack.
 Blame it on an albino.
 Classic, 'cause it works.
 I can never replace you guys.
 I love you, presents! Ooh.
 I have that.
 And that.
 Oh! I've already got this.
 Oh, my goodness.
 I already have this.
 I definitely don't need that.
    

                




                    			Hey, Liz.
 Package for you.
 Simon? Sorry, Liz.
 I had no other way into the building.
 And I lost all my contacts after I dropped my cell phone into the penguin exhibit.
 Yeah.
 I had my birthday at the Aquarium.
 What do you want? You're not my agent anymore.
 I'm still getting your business mail at my parents' house.
 Your contract's almost up, and Mr.
 Donaghy's office sent over that new one for you to sign.
 I'm not just gonna sign whatever Jack sends me.
 That's insulting.
 We haven't even talked about this.
 Well, I am the king of renegotiation.
 You watch the Wonder Pets on Nick Jr.
? I represent the turtle that tuck is based on.
 Yeah.
 No, thanks.
 I will deal with this myself.
 Did you miss me yesterday, Ms.
 Lemon? Awesome, great story.
 So, Ms.
 Maroney, did you miss me while I was gone yesterday? You weren't gone.
 I saw you.
 Kenneth! Just move.
 No Mr.
 Donaghy fired all the pages for a day.
 Didn't you notice your food wasn't pre-chewed? J-Mo, Marty Goldstein is your accountant too, right? I owe him a call.
 I bet he's going to tell me I can't write off all my shoplifting.
 No.
 He's calling you about his son's Bar Mitzvah.
 Marty wants to pay us crazy money just to show up.
 Well, you know I'm in.
 Getting paid to help a boy become a man is kind of my wheelhouse.
 Hey, I have a bone to pick with you.
 Look at this, Lemon.
 The Pentagon has hired GE to weaponize microwave technology.
 This is amazing.
 That was my old division.
 If I were still there, I would've controlled every aspect of that project.
 Planning, oversight, morale-boosting T-shirts indicating everyone "survived" a certain barbecue.
 There's nothing to challenge me here at Kabletown.
 Lemon, when was the last time I said, "no, senator, you're out of order"? Well, I've got something for you to do.
 You honestly thought I would just sign the same deal I got six years ago? Well, what would we negotiate about, Lemon? What do you even want? Well, for starters, I would like a hospital bed in my office.
 A real one.
 I don't care if it's against the law to resell them.
 My God.
 How far I've fallen.
 I used to be a legend.
 When there was a deal no one could close, they brought in Donaghy.
 So it's agreed.
 You'll be moving forward with this partnership.
 You know what, I'm insulted that you think it's beneath you to negotiate with me.
 Without me, there's no "TGS," so like it or not, we're getting into this.
 Call my assistant to set up a meeting.
 And by your "assistant," you mean you with a British accent? I have a new assistant.
 She's a cool college student from South Africa.
 Yeah, she'll be British.
 S06 E05 Today You Are a Man Hello? I'm back.
 What do you mean "you're back"? I wasn't here yesterday.
 Yes, you were.
 You were in the kitchen all day.
 Right over That's a broom.
 I know my job is to serve you all, but I thought that after six years, you at least thought of me the way an owner thinks of his dog.
 Kenneth, look No, sir! I am using my once-in-a-lifetime interruption to point out I am not even a dog to you.
 After all, when a dog goes missing, everyone's upset 'cause there's no dog milk for the babies.
 Jack wants a real negotiation? Well, I want a piece of the "TGS" merchandising.
 The catchphrase, "this smells," I wrote that.
 And when 20 cult members jump off a bridge together wearing "this smells" T-shirts, I should get a cut of that sale.
 Merchandising.
 That's smart.
 Here's the plan.
 I need to find a bathroom.
 It's on, Donaghy.
 Here they are! My favorite clients.
 Adam is going to be so excited to meet with you.
 He is a huge, huge fan.
 Yes, many of our viewers are obese.
 Now Marty, how Jewish is everyone here? 'Cause I may need to change parts of my act.
 These are the best clients you could get? Don't you represent Gina Gershon? My Nemesis? My Nemesis? Adam.
 You said you loved "TGS.
" I was being sarcastic.
 God, I told mom I wanted Transformer's theme for Bar Mitzvah.
 You know, this sucks.
 I hate you.
 Son Okay.
 We're going to go.
 Don't worry about the fee.
 You can just give it to us now.
 No.
 You're not going anywhere.
 If my boy wants Transformers, you're gonna be Transformers.
 I don't think so, Marty.
 If you don't help me out here, maybe the IRS finds out that your nine dependents are just vibrators.
 And Tracy, I'd hate for people to realize that your "charity" is just a front that has done nothing to make this country safer from Godzilla attacks.
 If anything, I've increased the likelihood.
 Hey, Kenneth.
 No, I'm not Kenneth.
 But he told me all about you guys.
 Let me guess who's who.
 You must be Toofer.
 I'm sorry, who are you? I was asking myself that same question.
 And I did not like the answer.
 So I made a change.
 I'm Hazel Wassername, and yes, you may recognize me from one of my two background acting gigs.
 Dr.
 Lingard, yesterday, we heard your daughter take full responsibility for her roles in these crimes.
 Where's Kenneth? He took my spot the Suze Orman show.
 What a first day.
 But you got to roll with the punches.
 Just like my hero, Ivan Drago, from Rocky IV.
 This is pathetic.
 Kenneth's trying to make us beg him to come back.
 Well, we are not doing that.
 I've learned from having children that when your kid throws a tantrum and holds his breath, you hold your breath too.
 When you regain consciousness, believe me, he's ready to leave the toy store.
 Finally, my client gets 5% gross merchandising, where gross means income before expenses and not gross like apples on a sandwich.
 to keep up with deflation Thank Obama And merchandising is a Nonstarter.
 This meeting is over.
 When you have a serious offer, email me at tatertotfreak@hotmail.
Com.
 From now on, you can deal with me directly.
 Simon, you're fired.
 Where did that come from? Are you being coached? Is it Pat Riley? Tell him the funmeister says, "hi.
" He'll know what that means.
 No one's helping me.
 Maybe you just weren't giving me enough credit when you said this was beneath you.
 Surprise.
 That's what the Donaghy method is all about.
 Use my techniques and I don't care who you're negotiating against.
 You'll win.
 I'm negotiating against you, you magnificent bastard.
 You.
 Charlotte Bob is in trouble.
 This is the part of the movie where I fell asleep.
 Jazz is gonna get you out of this.
 Say, hey! I am one slick brother.
 This blows.
 Be the robots from NFL on FOX.
 Boo! You suck.
 Here's your tea, Ms.
 Orman.
 There you are.
 Who are you? What happened to Hazel? I'm sorry, Ms.
 Orman.
 Hazel and I switched places.
 She's over at "TGS" now, but don't worry.
 It's temporary.
 I just want all the actors and writers there to realize how much they miss me.
 And why should they miss you? Well, I'd like to think on some level, we're all friends.
 Do you socialize together outside of work? Do you exchange gifts? Do you vacation together on nonjudgmental cruise lines? Well, no, but Listen, girlfriend.
 You're trying to solve an emotional problem, but what you have is a money problem.
 You want to be "friends" with people like Tracy Jordan and Jenna Maroney? They're rich, so show me the money.
 How much do you make? I'm not sure.
 My church requires a 110% tithe.
 How old are you? Don't worry about it.
 How much have you saved? Are you talking about saving squirrels from hawks? Zero.
 If you really want to be friends with people this, you are going to have to quit the page program, and get a real job so that you can earn for your future.
 What? No, I can't quit the page program.
 Well then, denied! You got the initiative.
 How do you keep it? By making a second first impression.
 You're going to wear dark colors, with a single power accent.
 Every hair in place.
 Hair movement Is a sign of weakness.
 And whatever you do, don't speak first.
 by the person who speaks first.
 Because what is speaking a sign of? Weakness? You, out.
 Fired.
 I hate those shoes.
 Are we starting? Please.
 All right.
 Let's start with salary.
 What are you doing? I'm sorry.
 Are you on some subconscious level seeing this as me toying with your manhood? Of course I am.
 I invented that.
 Boca 2002 You've seen the tapes? What? No.
 I-I just You are being coached by me.
 I'm sorry, Jack.
 I have to take this.
 Yes, may I please speak to pizza? The fake phone call to buy time in an emergency? Classic Donaghy.
 Okay, fine.
 You got me.
 Game over.
 No, no.
 This just levels the playing field.
 Going mano a mano against a real adversary, me It's the ultimate game.
 Jack Donaghy Playing with himself.
 It's a Jack-off.
 Well, great job.
 Adam locked himself in the bathroom.
 If we can get him out of there, you two have got to do better than that pathetic butchering of Who's on first?.
 "Who's on first"! That's the phrase I couldn't remember.
 What's going on here? I think we're waiting.
 I'm confused.
 We make other people wait.
 Forcing people to wait, throwing things, making crazy demands and never being satisfied Adam's acting like us.
 But he's not famous.
 Why is the government allowing this? Because today, he's the star.
 A Jewish star.
 If we don't make Adam happy, his dad is going to tell the IRS my house isn't a church, although I do let children drink wine there.
 Tracy, as fellow stars, we may actually be able to solve Adam's problem.
 I mean, when we're acting out, what makes us happy? When I'm acting out, it's never about the real problem.
 Like all actors, I'm not emotionally mature enough to deal with my feelings, you fart-face.
 I know you are, but what am I? Adam isn't upset about us.
 It's something else.
 We just have to find out what it is and save this Bar Mitzvah.
 So you've lost the initiative, perhaps by being a woman or a shorter man, but you can regain it by fighting on your home turf.
 No one has ever won a land war in Russia.
 Not Napoleon, not Hitler, not even Balki in the unaired ninth season of Perfect strangers.
 So where's your Russia? What's your home turf? The one place in the world where you cannot lose.
 Ice cream store.
 What are you doing? This is the men's room, Jenna.
 Not the C-list skank's room.
 That's solid, but that's not why we're here.
 Adam, we want to help.
 You're the star today.
 And we know how hard that can be.
 Look, we know you're not really mad about us.
 You acting out is about something else.
 You can tell us.
 We're in S.
A.
G.
 It's just Everyone expects me to dance with a girl today.
 And I don't know about girls.
 I mean, I've played this Japanese video game where you slap prostitutes to death, but you only ever dance with this penguin named Yamagiku.
 Adam, trust me.
 Any girl would want to dance with you.
 You're rich.
 And you're fat, so you'll die young.
 Women love that.
 Ad-rock, I'm going to tell you the same thing I tell my son.
 Put money in the girl's mouth.
 Also, my friend, Darryl, is your real father.
 Now you go get 'em.
 Hazel, why does my coffee order say "the black one" on it? Did you put peanuts on this? Yeah, it's delicious, hat guy.
 I'm allergic! Damn it! I have to write a 40-word exit evaluation of Kenneth! I wish I was dead! Okay, Kenneth.
 You win.
 Please come back.
 Okay.
 When is my birthday? I don't know.
 When is that party you throw that we never go to 'cause we don't know what to get the man who has nothing.
 Suze Orman was right.
 I need to quit the page program and get a real job.
 You know what we did today? An amazing rendition of "What's the guy's name who plays first base?" No, we solved a problem by just addressing it, head on.
 Tracy, what if you and I dealt with all of our problems that way? What if we were honest at work about what's bothering us? That would make everyone's lives a whole lot better.
 Like the polio vaccine.
 Or a no-bottom strip club near a Wendy's.
 Let's do it, J-Mo.
 Hey, Jack.
 Sorry I'm so late.
 You're not.
 I changed the clock on your phone.
 I just got here.
 Anyway, I really appreciate you coming to my neighborhood, my home turf, if you will.
 I see.
 Well played, Jack.
 You anticipated my counter move, employing "A shortness is weakness" power axiom.
 However, I knew that you might know that I knew to bring my own furniture, so I also brought my Jack Welch power pillow.
 I'm very sorry, sir.
 I thought you might do that, which is why I'm going to be the first person to do power quiet talking, forcing you to lean in and wonder if you're missing any key phrases.
 Like an idiot.
 I thought you'd try power quiet talking, which is why I'm wearing a hearing aid.
 Stalemate.
 I'm everything I hoped I'd be.
 Let's begin.
 a show on Christmas, no gross merchandising, and you have a run in your stocking.
 two weeks off at Christmas, I'm not wearing stockings.
 That's a vein.
 No raise, no vacation, and from now on, you have to say, "go for Liz," when you answer your phone.
 Um, hold on a sec.
 Come on, Lemon.
 I'm just doing the sorcerer's apprentice.
 You respond with a pirate holiday, and I have no choice but to play the hillbilly auction.
 It's all on the tapes.
 Forget it.
 This is taking too long.
 I'll do both sides.
 If you think I won't do the show without Lemon, think again.
 Jack, you're bluffing.
 Liz, we're out of here.
 If you walk out that door, you'll burn every bridge she has here.
 It'll be back to submitting topical menopause jokes to joy behar by fax.
 Please.
 You'd be in breach.
 You'd have more lawyers on you than a midtown hooker.
 You're all talk.
 It's like that time you said you'd hit on Carla Bruni in front of Sarkozy, and you totally backed down.
 So did you.
 Sorry, I have to take this.
 Hello? It's me.
 Nice try.
 I'm writing down a number.
 You're dreaming.
 Then I'd counter.
 I'd reject that.
 Then an elegante, parry with an elegante primo, No, that can't be right.
 Elegante, elegante primo, carry the one Good God.
 What? You won.
 I did? You got everything you wanted.
 Kabletown Jack made a mistake, and Lemon Jack pounced on it.
 I-me lost.
 Yes! I won! Nobody beats the Liz! Sorry.
 In your face.
 Mr.
 Hornberger.
 I got the message about the good-bye Kenneth brunch.
 I can't tell you how touched Yeah, that was a lie.
 But look who's here? Double actor announcement.
 Double actor announcement.
 Over the years, we've wasted a lot of time complaining about things other than what's really bothering us.
 From now on, Tracy and I are going to be more "haw-naist.
" Instead of just throwing tantrums, we're going to talk things through.
 Who's that lady? It's her fault that it's cold in here! Tracy Be honest.
 It's not about the air-conditioning, is it? Okay.
 It's just that I see a new page, and I'm not used to change.
 Because I was raised in foster care.
 Sounds like Tracy's missing someone.
 He's missing me.
 Boy, you are dumb sometimes.
 Tracy, this new page is Hazel, Kenneth's replacement.
 Kenneth wants to leave the page program so he can go make more money.
 But you need him here, don't you? Yes, I do need you, Kenneth.
 I depend on you.
 But I'm telling you to go, because now that I'm being honest, this job is a dead end for you.
 And it would be selfish of me to make you stay.
 Are you serious? Yes.
 Now go.
 Run, Kenneth.
 Run before I change my mind.
 Run, Kenneth! Run! Hey, your video says that after a negotiation, the winner should get the loser a gift.
 So I brought you this popcorn tin.
 There's no popcorn left, but it makes a great closet organizer.
 Socks, underwear, bras.
 I used to be a winner.
 Men wanted to be me, women wanted to sleep with me, bisexuals wanted to watch.
 Now look at me.
 A meaningless job, I can't get my wife back.
 What's the point? Maybe I'll just quit and Go work for a not-for-profit.
 Somewhere where there's less pressure and the people are nice.
 And I can wear sneakers and jeans on Friday.
 No, Jack, stop.
 It's okay.
 I hate myself.
 I want to be somebody else! I want to be a baby again! No, no, no.
 Look, you won.
 I'll sign whatever.
 Just don't cry.
 Daddy doesn't cry.
 I don't need gross merchandising.
 Excellent.
 What? What are you doing? Proving I could win.
 God! You were freaking me out.
 Exactly.
 Do you know why I lost earlier? Because of our friendship.
 I want you to have everything.
 And that made me make a mistake.
 In other words, I lost because of emotion, which I always thought was a weakness, but now I've learned it can also be a weapon.
 You didn't realize emotion could be a weapon? Have you not read the poetry of jewel? The point is, you had Liz's Jack on your side.
 And that's why he-me beat Kabletown Jack, until me-I turned the tables on you-you.
 So that means that my me-I taught your you-you a negotiation trick.
 Yes, I suppose you did.
 Wow.
 After six years, there's still room for growth in this friendship.
 What why are you signing that? You won? Lemon, I wanted to know I could win.
 I'm still going to take care of you.
 Excuse me, sirs.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, do you remember the other day when you said there are other opportunities for me at the company? Of course.
 Well, I would like to discuss those opportunities with you further.
 Because I am quitting the page program.
 But you have no other skills.
 He's a white male with hair, Lemon.
 The sky's the limit.
 To white men! Adam, we hear you're a Yankees fan.
 Tracy, aren't you a coach for the Yankees? You must know all the players.
 Sure.
 Those players have some crazy names.
 Like Derek and Alex.
 Who's on first? We're going to get confused.
 The guy who plays first is who? No, thank you.
 I mean the fellow's name.
 Everybody.
 The guy on first.
 His wife's name is don't.
 What's the guy's name on first base? Know what died in Vietnam.
 I'm not asking you who's on second.
 Let's just agree to disagree.
 Fourth base! Fourth base!   

                




                    			Liz, there's someone in the apartment.
  Someone who thinks you're special   in every single way  I wrote this song to wish you   a happy Valentine's Day  and the chorus goes here  yeah this is where the chorus goes  Criss, I  I didn't have time to write it   but the chorus goes here  Yeah! This is the chorus  Criss! Criss, it's okay.
 I really don't care about Valentine's.
 But you're a lady.
 Right? Why haven't I seen pictures of you as a baby? You know what I like to celebrate on February 14th? The 1920 founding of the league of women voters in Chicago, Illinois.
 They were supposed to meet on the 13th, but they all got lost, so But Valentine's Day is fun, Liz.
 I wrote you a song, I found you an awesome clip on Youtube.
 Good morning, everybody.
 I'm hanging out with my friend, John.
 Fox 5 morning news starts Look over there.
 And it starts right now.
 Oh, boy.
 And that's just the beginning.
 All right, Chros, all right.
 What else do you have planned? I don't know.
 How about dinner at some place amazing? You're kidding, right? It's New York, on Valentine's.
 You need a reservation.
 All right, so I'll make one.
 Right now.
 No, it's too late.
 Happy "league of women voters day.
" I've got a better idea.
 I will make you dinner at home.
 Mashed potatoes in a Martini glass, we'll open some of that wine we didn't give the super for Christmas because you decided it would come off as racist.
 I'm glad we gave him those G.
E.
D.
 books instead.
 We're gonna use real silverware.
 We're gonna light some candles.
 We'll play the soundtrack to Major League.
 You're making fun of me, but that love song is awesome.
 All in the comfort of our own living room.
 Look, Criss, you need to know what you're up against here.
 I am 0 for 40 on Valentine's Day.
 I will waste you! You'll have to go through this old bastard first! Bon Jovi.
 No, no, no, no, no, Lemon.
 Liz, you know, my mom did just die.
 Will you be my Valentine? I just realized I'm gay.
 If this is going to be "unterrible" for the first time ever, I'm not eating off a coffee table.
 Well, you know, for thousands of years Japanese diners have used traditional tatami mats Okay, no, no, no.
 We'll get a real table.
 But we're going to need one by tonight.
 That leaves us only one option.
 We, as a couple, are going to Ikea.
 Were you playing golf? It's freezing out.
 Yes, I was.
 In Avery's absence, I have extra time each day to, how do I put this? Release some energy.
 Are we talking about something gross? My animus has become pent up.
 Why don't you just come out and say you haven't had "mommy-daddy sheet monster times.
" I'm not about to cheat on the woman I love, and I've never "mommy-daddy sheet monstered" myself.
 Never? Not even during the Love Boat reunion? Anyway, sorry you're alone.
 I certainly know what it's like to have a crummy Valentine's Day.
 We're not going to chili's until I hit one.
 Go tell the guy the machine's not fast enough.
 I would kill to get hit in the crotch by a baseball today.
 Not only is my wife my mother-in-law has decided to visit.
 No.
 I've never had a mother-in-law, but I have seen Everybody loves Raymond.
 "Debra, where's the figurine I gave you? Raymond, I gave Debra a figurine.
" "Ma!" The Jessups are very white and very proper.
 The first Jessup moved to this country in 1760 to avoid an embarrassing regifting incident.
 But, my lord, I gave you these dueling pistols last yuletide.
 Yes, of course.
 Now, if you'll excuse me.
 It's been difficult to get Diana to acknowledge the reality of what's happened to her daughter.
 What is she, an Egyptian crocodile? 'Cause she is in "denial.
" I've had two coffees.
 Anyway, you'll be happy to hear that I am giving Valentine's a second chance this year.
 And here we are on six.
 For the first What a shame.
 It felt like we were just getting started.
 "Ma!" S06 Ep.
 06 Hey, Baby, What's Wrong Hazel, most people think of Valentine's Day as a celebration of the burning of a catholic loudmouth, but it's also about love.
 And escort prices going way up.
 Okay, so, how appropriate that on Valentine's, I introduce you to the new love of your life: This job, and everyone here.
 This is kind of the nerve center of TGS, the page desk.
 I've had a desk before.
 I managed a haunted house upstate.
 But, as you know, the haunted house industry is a real boys' club.
 Sure, it's hard, changing careers at my age.
 Well, I wouldn't know anything about being too old for something.
 But here I am, in New York, living at a 24 hour fitness, just ready to be inspired.
 Hazel, right? Yeah.
 It's so great to have a woman page here Thanks.
 To test unapproved Japanese medications on.
 Swallow.
 Swallow.
 Good girl.
 Now, let me know if all your pubic hair falls out.
 Oh, my God! No, that's what it's supposed to do.
 I want to make sure it doesn't cause seizures.
 Sorry to crash this sausage party Unnecessary.
 But I have an emergency.
 Sebastian, the producer of America's kidz got singing, OD'd last night in Guy Fieri's apartment.
 Oh, my God, that's terrible.
 Terrible for me.
 Oh, my God, that's terrible.
 Tonight's our first live show, I'm singing, and we don't have a line producer.
 So I need to borrow Pete.
 On Valentine's Day? No, Pete's got to go home to his wife.
 Actually, Paula didn't want to do anything for Valentine's, so she's just going out to dinner with her tennis instructor, mark.
 Perfect.
 Sound check's at 1:00.
 I'm having Sebastian's lucky earring sent from the morgue.
 Wear it.
 So you're not spending tonight with Paul? No, Paul's been performing on a transvestite cruise for the last month.
 It's called "Caribbean queens" for emphasize "No more love on the run".
 Billy Ocean is furious, and very litigious.
 But he's powerless as long as they stay in international waters.
 Sure.
 Since you asked, Criss and I are going to Ikea.
 For the hate-sex after your fight? Good idea.
 No, we're not going to fight.
 We're getting one thing.
 I have a plan you're going to fight.
 Ikea's where I used to go pick up newly-single vulnerable chicks.
 I've gotten women there two, three points hotter than me.
 So, you knowfours.
 Look, I don't want to go.
 But we need a table.
 And if Criss thinks he's the guy to get Liz Lemon on board with "Saint lame-entine's nay" Honey, that sucks.
 We better be able to survive a simple trip to Ikea.
 No, Liz, don't test it.
 Especially this early in a relationship.
 It's like when Mickey Rourke tested his catapult on me.
 I was almost listening.
 Where are you going? You never take my advice.
 Ms.
 Maroney.
 Thank you, Kenneth.
 We'll take a pube count, but it doesn't feel worth it.
 Maybe I'm hitting them too hard.
 And I should not have walked past that sporting goods store where the mannequins have nipples.
 And what race were those mannequins, because their skin was gray.
 They were like faceless sex aliens.
 Jack.
 Diana, you're here, I thought you'd be at the house.
 Yes, I dropped my bags off and shook hands with the baby, but I wanted to come talk to you about Avery's situation.
 What situation is that? According to your Christmas letter, Avery is in Asia on business.
 You know that she was kidnapped by the north Korean secret police.
 Don't be vulgar.
 As we said in the letter, she'll be back soon with some charming Asian ceramics.
 I'm sorry, but who is this "we" you keep referring to? Your husband has been dead for 15 years.
 Wonderful news.
 You know our pacing horse, squanto? She's foaling in the spring.
 Diana, I know the Jessups don't like to talk about unpleasant matters.
 But sometimes I feel like I'm the only person trying to get Avery back.
 Well, that is what I wanted to discuss.
 It has been months, and I feel like nothing has happened.
 Diana, extracting an American from North Korea is a, uh Is a lot more difficult than organizing a round-Robin paddle tennis tournament.
 What about organizing three round-Robin paddle tennis tournaments? I heard that one of them was a disaster.
 Who told you that? Bebe Butler? She's trying to destroy me.
 This situation has become embarrassing.
 One of Frederick's old Washington friends has some connections with the Transylvanian consulate at the united nations.
 I made an appointment for both of us.
 Let me stop you right there.
 I've been to the U.
N.
 repeatedly.
 Mein herr, meine frau Avery Jessup Kim Jong-Il vuvuzela Charlize Theron Boomerang my Sheila back to her Joey, mate.
 And it's gotten me nowhere.
 The U.
N.
 is a useless organization, with a ridiculous army.
 Robin's egg blue helmets? Great camouflage, if you're invading an easter egg hunt.
 Jack, perhaps you're not having success because of that attitude.
 I find you catch more flies with honey.
 First of all, why do you want flies? Our appointment is at 11:00.
 Strewth, what a bull-dingered Valentine's Day.
 And Jack? I speak Australian.
 Let ferry ride, was the first time when we've ever been on a boat together.
 Unless you count that time when the goose chased you into the Central Park boat pond.
 Criss, I need to ask you something.
 Have you ever been to an Ikea? Do you know what we're walking into? You know what? I like myself.
 I have good taste in drapes.
 I wish I'd died on Iwo Jima and never met you.
 What was that? Not us.
 We are a good team, and we have a plan.
 We're going to go in, get the kurtz with the birch veneer, and then get out.
 Then go home and have an amazing night together.
 I just got my period.
 Liz, what are you worried about? Come on, this is gonna be fun.
 I'm going back to those cute bowls.
 I swear to God, I will stab you! So tense.
 Just like my mom's back.
 Dude, what was that? I just don't want to be alone today.
 In 48 years, I haven't had one good Valentine's.
 Man, if I weren't with Lynn now we could team up.
 Valentine's Day is the perfect time to meet vulnerable women.
 It's scumbag Christmas! Just tell me what to do.
 Look, guys like us have to pick low-hanging fruit.
 We look like Far side drawings.
 So we go where women are sad, desperate, and weak Cat shelters, blood banks, the ice cream stand at a Celtic woman concert And we strike.
 Another good place is the beauty salon, where white girls try to do black hair.
 Sisters come out crying, feeling all bad about themselves, and we walk up on them all, "Hey, baby, what's wrong?" You're married, I actually have a girlfriend, all our dirtbag knowledge is going to go to waste.
 No, it's not.
 Lutz, prepare for the adventure of a lifetime.
 Then after we watch Fievel goes west, we're gonna get you some action.
 Hey, you needed to see me? Did you book a female hair-person for me tonight? Who's Karen? I need someone named Trentence, or Orbino.
 Get in the game, Pete.
 Your star is freaking out.
 What are you freaking out about? You sing live all the time.
 This is different.
 It's not some rinky-dink late night show that a bald idiot produces.
 It's the largest audience I've ever performed for.
 And after spending all season ripping cute kids new ones, everyone wants me to fail.
 Tomorrow night on America's kidz got singing, the judge becomes the opposite of the judge.
 Come on, guys, a little effort.
 Jenna Maroney's singing live, and all of America is just waiting for that To get  over and over and over again with a.
 Nice bleeping.
 Sorry about earlier.
 Jenna, you need to relax.
 Listen up, if tonight isn't a huge "jiumph," which is short for "Jenna triumph," it's on you.
 And like all celebrities, I'm very good at shifting the blame.
 I attacked Nancy Kerrigan.
 Did you get my message? Yes, your excellency.
 And I also wish you, a "bear-y" happy Valentine's Day.
 He said it'll be another hour.
 The assistant attache has a few minutes around 14:30.
 office is in America, right? Do you see a 14 on my watch? Yes, it's the date.
 Happy Valentine's Day.
 That's cute.
 And what insolvent country do you come from? New Jersey.
 I'm just a weirdo.
 Will you please stop being so hostile? You just make everything worse.
 No wonder you haven't accomplished anything.
 You know what? Avery loved a good fight.
 She used to call the cable company and dispute our bill, just for the sport of it.
 She wouldn't stand for this dog and pony show.
 I have organized several dog and pony shows, and I'm offended by what you're implying.
 How are you Avery's mother? We have a few things in common, Jack.
 We both married much, much older men, which can be hard, or, more often, flaccid.
 I have an idea.
 Maybe, we just don't talk at all.
 Maybe we sit quietly and read our, soccer magazine.
 Mr.
 Jordan's lizard, Jeremy, is always escaping and biting everyone.
 Like owner, like lizard.
 Oh, man.
 That's why Mr.
 Jordan got him a GPS collar.
 Now it's easier to find Well that can't be.
 It says he's inside the room.
 Maybe you're reading it wrong? Three feet, two feet, it says he's right on top of us.
 Oh, my God, my face.
 He's mating with my mouth.
 He likes you! Here's a good one.
 Go to a strip club on Father's Day, and shout things like, "I'm proud of you!" Classic.
 Where's Pete? I just dyed my gums because I want them to pop on camera.
 But now they're burning.
 Another way to meet damaged women is to hang out with actresses.
 Actresses? Where? How young are they? I'll do nudity.
 Back in the day, used to work as a stock boy in a chic uptown department store, called "Ray-Ray's discount clothes bucket.
" I would go to the swimsuit section and switch the tags.
 I'd take a size six and put a size twelve sticker on it.
 And then some thick girl would try to squeeze into it, and come out of the dressing room like, "I've gotten bigger.
 Why do I even bother dieting?" And I'm all like, "Hey, baby, what's wrong?" You know, a great place to meet vulnerable women is weight watchers.
 I did "watchers" to stay pageant-fit, but it was too much math for a six-year-old.
 Thank God I found cigarettes.
 "Weight watchers," got it.
 And if worse comes to worse, make the lady feel vulnerable.
 Check this out.
 Baby, did someone throw cereal on you? Let's get you out of these wet clothes.
 What is wrong with you people? Whatever.
 Jeremy says she's a tease anyway.
 Now, let's hit weight watchers.
 How is there no signal in here? Silence, prisoner.
 I mean, can I help you, valued customer? There you are.
 What are you doing? Buying stuff for tonight, to make it awesome.
 Look, salt and pepper shakers.
 You put them together, it makes a heart.
 Take them apart, two red sperms.
 We're not getting that.
 What's with the "neggy" vibes, jeez.
 I can get things.
 Not if you're not paying for them.
 Let's go get that table, buddy.
 Ikea.
 First things first.
 I am from Transylvania, but I am not a vampire.
 I'm just a night owl with a terrible garlic allergy.
 So, this is regarding that boy who went missing in my castle? No, we're here about my wife.
 My daughter, Avery Jessup, she's in North Korea.
 Yes, the Jessup case.
 Yes, I would like to speak to Kim Jong-Un, immediately.
 That is unacceptable.
 I understand.
 The operator wouldn't let me dial long-distance.
 So, thank you both for coming.
 No.
 That is exactly what I expected would happen.
 Does that hurt? Well, I'm so sorry.
 Well that is just the beginning, youpenis! This isn't some idiotic civil war in some country without oil.
 This is my favorite daughter.
 And she is a beautiful white American.
 So why the fudge isn't everyone fudging freaking the fudge out! She's right.
 You are a penis! I'm going to call security.
 One of the guys has a whistle.
 Vampire push.
 Did you just threaten her? I want you to apologize to this woman, right now.
 I am a very powerful man.
 I can see to it that Transylvania never sees another episode of Friends.
 No! Monica and Chandler just slept together in London.
 I'm I'm sorry.
 Okay.
 Now admit the U.
N.
 is useless.
 It is.
 Half the building is a laser tag arena.
 Admit it's annoying when Bono comes around.
 It's the worst.
 Every time he says he's not hungry when we collect money for pizza, and then he eats, like, three slices.
 You disgust me.
 Come on, let's go.
 And, Cjokula, at Monica and Chandler's wedding, Rachel's the one who is pregnant.
 Finally, tables.
 Stop walking so close to me! I'm sorry.
 It's this place.
 But also, if you would just let me get a few steps ahead of you first, and then you walk? I found it.
 Nice.
 What? It's nice, it's just I don't know if I'm feeling it, you know? What about this idea? I know a guy who cuts glass No.
 I took measurements, I looked at colors, we came here.
 This is the plan.
 Yeah, it's just that this table, it feels kind of uptight.
 And I think something a little more fun would be a better table, for me.
 Well, I don't know, Criss.
 Maybe a more fun table wouldn't be as supportive.
 What? No, no, we are not doing this.
 We are not letting this table be a metaphor for our relationship.
 That's what Ikea wants us to do.
 I'm just not sure my chair wants to be with this table.
 Why, because deep down your chair would rather be with other chairs? I think the table needs to stop listening to its mother.
 Well, it's just the table thinks the chair takes too many camping trips with Richard.
 Almost there, teammate.
 To the warehouse! Seriously? "Zoo York.
" Okay, everybody, sound check for Ms.
 Maroney.
 No, I don't want a live band.
 Live bands make mistakes.
 Pete, I have made love to Alfonso, he can't keep rhythm, get him out of here.
 That's a wrap on Alfonso.
 Alfonso Disparioso, everybody.
 This is your moment.
 The world breathes for you.
 I love you, myself.
 And playback.
 Jenna, you're not singing.
 Yes, I am.
 I'm sorry I was such an Italian in there, but that was unacceptable.
 No, you were wonderful.
 The way your eyes went dead, just like Avery's.
 I didn't know you had that in you.
 "Yosemite Sam" was based on my grandfather, so yes, I do have a temper.
 There are a lot of things you don't know about me, Jack.
 In 1978, I was in Playboy, just wearing a necktie and holding hands with a black girl.
 How could I have ever said that you're not your daughter's mother.
 Those incredible cheekbones, like an evil Disney queen.
 No, I misjudged you.
 The way you broke that man down like a folding table at a dog and pony show.
 And I am sorry I compared you to my late husband.
 You are not some liver-spotted old man constantly spilling hot tea in his lap until his whole crotch was useless.
 Useless! You are young.
 You are virile.
 Your hair, like a lion's mane.
 My eyes, like two pools of ice water.
 Let's keep walking, in the cold.
 Yes.
 Do you like baseball? Let's talk about baseball.
 I love baseball.
 Abner Doubleday.
 The bats are long and hard.
 The gloves are girls.
 Balls! Jeter's thighs in those pants.
 New topic.
 You know, it's funny.
 If those teeth were in your vagina, you'd be considered a monster.
 Well, Jenna, there's nothing physically wrong with you.
 That's impossible.
 Why can't I sing? Well, it must be psychosomatic.
 Don't worry, that's just a fancy doctor word for "your brain is broken.
" Unfortunately, there's no field of medicine that deals with the brain.
 But, I can give you a pamphlet for a cult.
 You don't understand.
 This is how I make my living.
 Like me and my cell phone bedazzling.
 I have to be able to sing.
 Maybe you're shutting down because of all the pressure.
 There is a lot riding on this performance.
 Pressure? That's ridiculous.
 Pressure is trying to pass for four when you just turned seven, at the "Miss Toddler Panama city" pageant.
 You're crammed into the same five-inch heels you wore the year before, blood pooling in your toes.
 But you know if you don't win, mom can't fix the hole in the gator fence, so you'll be up all night, stabbing gators.
 Pressure is performing on a party boat that catches on fire, your throat burning from the smoke.
 You still sing so beautifully that it calms the passengers, so that you and the crew can escape.
 Pressure It's the "Rule of threes," Pete.
 Is singing the Yemeni national anthem while a handsome but ruthless general pushes a scimitar into your neck, Kristin Chenoweth's corpse at your feet.
 That's pressure.
 This live show is nothing.
 Well, there's something weird going on here.
 You feel that sexual energy too? I mean, but it would be wrong to act on it.
 Well, it's 5:00 somewhere.
 No, this isn't happening.
 They're sold out.
 This is why you don't just choose one option.
 We were in a room full of tables.
 No, this is why you don't waste 45 minutes wandering around the "Valentine's marketplace.
" Trying to find stuff for tonight.
 For you.
 Really cool stuff.
 You still have those salt and pepper shakers, don't you? Well, I don't want them anymore.
 'Cause I'm not feeling romantic.
 God, you actually got me excited about today.
 Valentine's is the worst! It's even worse than earth day.
 You just see so many dirty feet in sandals.
 I don't know, Liz.
 This could have been special.
 I had stuff planned.
 No, you didn't.
 You wrote half a song, and thought you'd "wing it," like you do with everything.
 I mean, if you'd had a plan we wouldn't even be in this hellhole.
 Good, go wide with it.
 Go.
 Really? Well, how's your super-planned life going, Liz? You're 40-something One! Come on, Criss.
 You have no kids.
 The only thing you like about your job is taking home free sodas.
 And you're attacking the only good thing in your life because of a stupid table.
 This isn't about the table.
 This is about you never following through on anything, ever.
 It's why you didn't finish law school, it's why you still aren't done filling out your 2010 census.
 Well what race am I supposed to check? We all come from Africa.
 You know what? Ikea tested us, we failed.
 Okay, just go.
 That's a good idea.
 We're done here.
 Yeah, we are definitely done.
 Thank you.
 That's why I get out of the nidurgangur in the morning.
 It's one of our cheaper beds.
 There you are.
 I think your break is over, Ms.
 Wassername.
 Did I make a mistake, Kenneth? A big mistake.
 Tracy Jordan threw milk at you, and you didn't even thank him? How does that reflect on the page program? And our mascot, "Pagey," a piece of paper.
 Everyone here is awful.
 I need to be inspired.
 I came here to start a glamorous new life.
 'Cause today, anyone can be famous.
 I mean, look at foxy knoxy.
 What did she ever do besides not kill anybody? So, why not me? I could have a fragrance, or a line of children's handbags, or be in a reality show with other kooky dumb sluts.
 You don't think I have dreams? Last night, I dreamed a baby ate my hair.
 But sometimes, you have to start at the bottom.
 I'd like for you to make a delivery for me.
 And, while you're out, think about how your page underwear has been handed down, page to page, for over 70 years.
 So, do you like music? Yes.
 I have supported the Baltimore Philharmonic for years.
 These days, it's just a boom box and a guy in a crab costume.
 He gets shot out of a Cannon at Ravens Games.
 The city may not be thriving.
 Well, it's not just Baltimore.
 We live in a benighted age.
 The last time I heard classical music on television was Schubert's final sonata in a commercial.
 Now why would anyone use music written by a man dying of syphilis to sell douches.
 Because people are getting stupider.
 Think how much Schubert accomplished in the 31 years he was alive.
 Coming through.
 And then there's, this guy.
 My taxes are paying for your healthcare! Do a sit-up! I really underestimated you, Jack.
 Maybe we shouldn't talk at all.
 How do you think our boys are doing in there? I guess it's been a pretty rough week.
 Yesterday, I ate all the cheese out of the mouse traps.
 Now, who'd like to continue this magic over drinks? A Cosmo's five points? Okay.
 All right.
 Hey, baby, what's wrong? Nothing's wrong, you think something's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? Um, didn't the white lady just mess up your hair? I work for the post office, I was delivering a package.
 But you think my hair's messed up? No, I You're gonna tell me about black lady hair, you "Louie Anderson" little bitch? Run! Run for your life! Hi.
 Are you shopping for someone? Do you know what size she is? No.
 I don't know.
 Maybe.
 No.
 I see.
 It's okay.
 I have an Uncle who uses my discount here all the time.
 I'll take it.
 Okay, Jenna.
 I think I know what your problem is.
 It's the "yips.
" When will congress pass a law to get those bastards out of our country? No, no.
 The "yips" is something that happens to athletes.
 They get in their heads, and stop being able to do stuff they've done a million times.
 Like, bet me during a poker game at Tony Romo's house? I know you don't think it's mental, but it is.
 And, I get it.
 It's scary to admit How would you know? Because it happened to me! I was the best they'd ever seen, and I blew it! Peter Hornberger, a shoo-in for this Olympic squad, about to arch.
 You're going to want to watch this, folks, so put down your Rubik's cube, turn off that Yakov Smirnoff standup tape, and set all your swatches to right now.
 I've been shot! Someone run into town and find a payphone! This happened to you? We have something in common? Look, tonight is huge for you, and for me.
 If this goes well, it could get us both out of the late-night ghetto.
 Because you and me? We're prime-time, baby.
 Fine, it's mental.
 I have the "yips.
" What am I supposed to do? Okay, we don't have a lot of time.
 So, maybe just by acknowledging the problem, we fixed it? I think we did.
 I'm cured! It's worse.
 I can't open my mouth.
 Happy Valentine's to the two lovers.
 Come into my restaurant for the romance.
 No, no, no, we're not together.
 What? But, this is a crime.
 Such a beautiful, age-appropriate couple.
 You are perfect together.
 You are like pasta, and a mouth.
 Do you not think that she's beautiful? Yes, empirically she is attractive.
 And is he not handsome, with hair like black vermicelli? Yes, he is handsome, but The only "but" we speak of tonight, is the butt of the human ass.
 Valentine's, she is a celebration of love, and sex, and touch.
 Come inside, and have the most romantic notte of your lives.
 We have a unisex bathroom, with, come si dice, no lock, and extra mirrors.
 I have to go check on Liddy.
 I have to go walk around the park.
 Maybe forever.
 Darn it, what am I doing wrong? This is it, Lutz.
 The Ikea parking lot.
 If you can't close the deal here, you're on your own.
 Back in the day, you know how many women me and Lamar Odom's dad picked up here? And keep in mind, back then this was a marsh, where people came to shoot at fish.
 There's your low-hanging fruit.
 We can teach you no more.
 Fly, Lutz, fly.
 Hey, baby, what's wrong? Lutz? Mom-boss? What are you doing? Oh, my God, Lutz just hit on Liz.
 About time.
 The last six years has been like watching Moonlighting.
 Hang on, were you hitting on me? I'm sorry.
 I just wanted to have a nice Valentine's Day, so Frank and Tracy tried to help me out.
 But I keep screwing up.
 Every time I get a good thing going, I do something stupid and blow it.
 You want to know the reason why Lutz is alone? Lutz! And Dollhouse penis syndrome.
 Oh, my God.
 I'm female Lutz.
 I love you too.
 No, I mean I'm my own worst enemy.
 Do you want to know the reason Liz is alone? Liz.
 Also I menstruate a lot.
 Oh, God, does this mean I have to change? I have to go back and be the bigger person? What if Criss already left and I have to go find him? It's so cold.
 Oh, realizations are the worst.
 Excuse me, are you Jenna Maroney? My goodness, are these for me? Yes.
 For your grave.
 I hope you die out there tonight.
 Dude, that was a disaster.
 Worse than me trying to send a fax.
 Valentine's days alone.
 I mean, 48.
 Are you crazy? You're not alone.
 You spent Valentine's with us.
 Yeah, two people who care enough about your sexual needs to blow off their wives and girlfriends.
 No.
 Right now, Angie's in a hotel room dressed as a clown.
 And I'm supposed to get into an elephant costume and interview her for a job at the circus.
 I spent Valentine's Day with friends.
 Friends? We are work acquaintances at best.
 At worst, we are rivals who inspire and try to make each other better.
 Now let's go get some tiny meatballs.
 Meatballs, here we come! Meatballs! Pick up your phone, Criss.
 Jack, I can't talk.
 I am mentally writing an apology, and it's giving me a tension headache, and I am so cold! I want to have sex with Avery's mother.
 No! You can't do that.
 I know.
 And maybe it's just the loneliness, and the frustration, and stupid Valentine's Day.
 But she's amazing.
 And come on, didn't our friends the ancient Olmecs bed both mother and daughter to satisfy their Jaguar gods? And everybody loves them.
 Jack, listen to me.
 That is wrong on so many levels.
 You can never sleep with her, never, never, ever, ever Never, ever, ever.
 Never, ever, ever, ever! I get it, Lemon.
 Thank you.
 Just hearing your labored breathing while you walk up stairs has purged me of all sexual desire.
 Yeah, well, glad I could help.
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to clean up the mess I made here with Criss.
 You're still here.
 I tried to call you.
 How did Right.
 My ringtone is the sounds of cooking.
 Which is perfect, because I love cooking.
 But when I'm cooking Lemon, please hang up, I can't listen to any more of this.
 Yeah.
 Look I was planning on saying "it was my fault," and, "please, let's get back together.
" But, it doesn't look like I need to.
 What do you mean, "get back together"? You thought we broke up because of that fight? No, that would be idiotic.
 You wanted a table, I wasn't super-helpful.
 Who cares? I tend to care, you know I let little things ruin stuff.
 I mean, I stopped shopping at kmart because I found out that Kathy Ireland didn't design any of her signature socks.
 But maybe, after 40 years I can change.
 Don't bother.
 You can get mad at dumb stuff.
 That's your thing.
 I'll get over it.
 That's my thing.
 It's kind of perfect.
 But how are we ever going to break up? I don't know, maybe we never will.
 Maybe we'll still be celebrating Valentine's together Do you think our ape overlords will let us? They'll let you and me do whatever we want, because we'll be spying on the rest of humanity for the ape police.
 Wait, where did you get a table? I made it.
 I gathered fallen tree branches from Riverside Park.
 That's where we first met.
 Yeah.
 And the top is a Herman Cain poster I found in a dumpster.
 Excuse me? I have a package for Liz Lemon.
 Sure, come in.
 You're the head writer TGS? But you're so beautiful.
 Charlie what now? I love your brown hair.
 It's so bouncy, like the "after" picture in a lice ad.
 Thank you.
 It's from intermittent washing.
 And you own this place? Yeah.
 Holy Moly, there's stairs? And a dining room table? Is this your boyfriend? Yeah.
 He made me dinner.
 Mashed potatoes in a Martini glass.
 Who are you, the president? Of France? I know, right? You are an inspiration, Liz Lemon.
 I am an inspiration.
 I'll see you at work tomorrow.
 Happy Valentine's Day.
 You too.
 I want your life.
 And I will have it.
 I like her.
 45 seconds.
 Jenna.
 This is a nightmare.
 My Nemeses, Abigail Breslin and the woman from those progressive insurance commercials, are in the audience.
 Just, relax panic, don't.
 You failed me, Pete.
 And when I go down, I'm taking you with me.
 You'll never work again.
 But I have five kids.
 And grandkids can't be far behind, little Evelyn's so sexual.
 30 seconds.
 These shoes hurt, mommy.
 Good.
 Focus on the pain, not on the fact that if you lose, I'm gonna pour acid on your Barbies.
 Okay, come on.
 The shoes.
 The fire.
 The sword.
 It's the pain.
 She needs the pain to distract her.
 I need to hurt her, but she's all the way over there.
 How could I possib Come on, Hornberger.
 Archer Arch! Is she bleeding? It looks like an arrow wound.
 Jack.
 I didn't know you'd be down here.
 Nice place.
 What did you pay for all this wood? I don't believe we've met.
 Jack, this is Someone I saw fighting with a dog outside a liquor store.
 I'm Herb.
 'Cause you are what you smoke, right "Jackie"? Hey, where's the head? We're in mixed company, but let's just say I've got to go wreck your toilet.
 It's down that hallway on the right-hand side.
 Diana, don't do this.
 I'm lonely, Jack.
 So am I.
 Believe me, I know how you feel.
 Being alone on Valentine's Day, frustrated in all kinds of ways.
 Just wanting a connection, to hold someone's hand.
 Ideally when she's wearing only a necktie.
 But you deserve better than Herb.
 Why is this bathroom full of wine bottles? But what I deserve, I shouldn't have.
 Me neither.
 So, what are we going to do about it? Oh, baby.
 Oh, yes.
 Yes! That's good.
 Yes.
 Oh, yeah, don't stop.
 Just like that.
 Oh, yeah, but a little lower.
 Yes! Yeah, baby! Oh, yeah! Oh! Nope, nope.
 Let me have one.
 Give it to him, Frank.
 Give it to him, we're friends.
 You can have one of mine.
 Finally, I can say, happy Valen My legs! This get me out of sex.
 My God, Liz.
 We're wearing the exact same lipstick.
 Looks better on you, of course.
 I wish I could just cut those lips right off and wear them.
 Happy Valentine's Day, lovers.
 Happy Valentine's Day to us all.
   

                




                    			 [Phone vibrates] What? Lemon, I'm gonna be late for our meeting.
 I had to get out of my car and walk.
 Fifth Avenue is closed for a joint pain walkathon.
 It's only four blocks but they are so slow.
 I'm running late, too.
 My subway ride was the standard amazingness.
 No, that's not how it works.
 Let people off first, otherwise The train's going express for no reason.
 [Sneezes] Next stop, one millionth street and Central Park jogger memorial highway.
 Am I the last one in this city still following the rules of being a person? You know what, New York is overrated.
  Three bucks, two bags, one me  Say, where does a young prostitute get started in this town? Overrated? Lemon, we live in the world capital of culture, finance and King Kong attacks.
 New York is a testament to man's greatness.
 No, New York is a testament to man's selfishness.
 I quote, "she is a thug in a cocktail dress.
" Alex Mccord, Real housewives of New York.
 Give me your wallet.
 Now, technically that was about Luann being a bitch at Sonia's Art show.
 But hey, you never let me talk about h-wives this long.
 Let's just get this over with.
 Okay, well, I don't know if Sonja's ever gonna finish that toaster oven cookbook, but if she does, I am gonna buy it.
 [Exciting jazz music]  S06 Ep.
08 The Tuxedo Begins Ugh, I can actually feel myself getting sick.
 Am I the only person who saw Obama's press conference on how to sneeze? [Sneezes] Miss Lemon, the NBC gym sent this up for you.
 Oh, what is that smell?! It's my gym bag, Pete.
 Women do sweat.
 The gym said the odor was attracting bugs that were attracting bats that were attracting bat-hawks.
 Oh, also, the gym is closed.
 Well, don't worry, I will wash my workout clothes because I actually care how my behavior affects other people.
 Unlike the d-bag who let the elevator door close on me this morning.
 [Laughs] It was funny because you were so mad.
 Boy, when I move on to my new job I'm sure gonna miss you two and your whole Sam and Diane thing.
 Uh, Sam and Diane are the lesbian couple in my building who murdered each other.
 Is this my costume for the commercial parody? It's in my contract that I only play blondes, non-Irish redheads, or bald sex robots.
 Look, it's just for the old lady before picture.
 People won't even know it's you.
 Well then have Liz do it.
 She already has the frown lines.
 There, there they are.
 How funny, I was just talking about them and there they are.
 As always, I will step up and help because without people like me, civil society collapses completely.
 Oh, don't be so dramatic.
 That's my thing.
 And if you take it away from me, I will kill myself.
 And then you.
 Oh, I'm sorry we're starting so late.
 I know we're all very excited to adjust the TGS schedule to accommodate Tracy's next movie.
 I won an Oscar, so now I get to do real art.
 Beg snow dogs phase.
 There was a lot of traffic and, uh, I was attacked in a construction tunnel.
 Anyway, uh, this spreadsheet is the current schedule.
 Wait, you got mugged? Oh, I shouldn't hug you, I'm sick.
 This lamp is you.
 Ow, hot! That sucks, J.
D.
 I got mugged all the time growing up in the Bronx.
 Okay, I got in trouble the last time I said this, but maybe you were asking for it dressed like that.
 I wasn't wearing a tuxedo at the time, Lemon.
 The mugger took my cufflinks.
 All I have here are tuxedo cufflinks and I'm not about to wear them with a suit And look like an idiot.
 Give me the bad news.
 How black was this dude? On a scale from Lisa Bonet to dotcom.
 This is the thing that's bothering me.
 My assailant was a middle-aged white man wearing a button down shirt and dockers.
 Dockers! Not some drug addict or gang aficionado.
 His knife was from Eddie Bauer.
 Oh, my God.
 That means Please interrupt me.
 This is a sign.
 The lower classes are getting cranky about the rich earning all of their money away from them.
 Can't they see this is in their best interest? How could we pay their salaries without using their money? We're on the verge of a class war.
 There's no class war.
 You getting mugged just proves what I said to you on the phone.
 New York is a selfish filth-monster, and eventually, it gets all of us.
 It's Ghostbusters 2 all over again.
 No, my getting mugged was New York doing what she does best Calling a great man to action.
 It's the original Ghostbusters all over again.
 My attack was a wake up call.
 The rich need to defend themselves.
 I don't know, Jack.
 You can try to change New York, but it's like Jay-Z says.
 "Concrete bunghole where dreams are made up.
 There's nothing you can do.
" That's a wrap.
 [Laughs] That commercial parody is gonna be hilarious.
 What's a commercial? [Coughs] Oh, my God.
 You sound terrible.
 Oh is that brain? Hopefully it's not an important parg of my blurn.
 Please, don't get me sick.
 Paul's finally coming home tonight.
 And his sexpectations will be high.
 Maybe I should wear this home.
 Show Chris what he'll be looking at in 40 years.
 Looser skin, same underwear.
 [Coughs] Hey, Pete, can I have a car home tonight? [Old woman voice] I'm old and very sick.
 And there's a Monk rerun on.
 [Coughs] I'm sorry, I'm losing my voice.
 There's a Monk rerun on.
 Nope, no dice.
 I can't order you a car unless it's after 9:00, or you have a note from your killer.
 Aw.
 So you got mugged, huh, Mr.
 Donaghy? And you caught the guy who did it.
 Good for you.
 Oh, no, Len, Tracey is helping me with this.
 But I can see how you went there.
 I have a criminal skull shape.
 Len, commissioner Kelly and I are friends.
 We have competing columns in Irish arguments weekly, America's only all-caps magazine, but Ray hasn't returned my phone call, and I know that you were once a police officer.
 I was part of a special task force of very young-looking cops who infiltrated high schools.
 How do you do, fellow kids? What? So I'm glad you called me, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I checked with my contacts on the force and got you this free pamphlet.
 Len, I don't want a pamphlet.
 I want a show of force.
 A demonstration of who's in control of this city.
 I want a cop on every corner.
 Look, that's not gonna happen.
 It's just one mugging.
 Wait a second.
 Where did you get that suit? I'm not embarrassed.
 I get all my outfits at Ann Taylor loft.
 Their clothes fit my body and my budget.
 Exactly, budget.
 You have no interest in helping me.
 You're one of them.
 What do you make? Five figures? But don't let the woman who's blackmailing me know that.
 And the police have no interest in helping me either despite the hundreds of dollars I pay every year in taxes.
 They think that I'm the enemy.
 We have no choice but to take matters into our own hands.
 I agree! You do? Oh, no! [Coughing] [Door chimes] No, if I sneeze, I'll do it like the president taught me.
 I'm pregnant with a kitty cat.
 Those are my popsicles! [Chuckles] Well, hello, sexy.
 Hello, Paul.
 I'm wearing an edible nightgown.
 It's breadstick flavor and it comes with a dipping sauce.
 [Yawns] Oh, you poor thing.
 You must be so tired.
 Oh, no, no, no, not at all.
 I have been thinking about this night for a long time.
 [Yawns] Uh-oh, yawns are contagious.
 Like all the Thai STDs my penis is about to give you.
 Ooh.
 Okay, well, give me five minutes and then I'll unpack [Yawns] The sex monkey I bought in Jakarta.
 Ooh.
 What what happened last night? We talked for a while and then we fell asleep.
 Without doing anything.
 W how is that possible? We are Jenna and Paul.
 Did we mix up our days and accidentally both roofie each other? Or did we just fall asleep? What like some boring, normal, sit-com couple? Like, Mr.
 Brady and tiger the dog? Let's just think.
 We hate normal.
 Normal is death.
 But we didn't hate last night.
 So, it must not have been normal.
 Paul, I think we just found another level of sexuality.
 It's a whole new fetish called Both: Normalling.
 So last night, I napped on you and you liked it, you sick bitch.
 Oh, yeah.
 And I put that Afghan all over you because I thought your feet might get chilly.
 So chilly.
 Oh, I just had the sickest idea.
 We go out as a couple to bed, bath and beyond and shop for home necessities.
 [Whispers] In front of everybody.
 Normalling in public? You delicious whore.
 [Giggles] Really, Trump? My idea is stupid? Well you make your hair every morning by sticking your head in a cotton candy machine.
 What are you guys doing? The police can't be counted on to protect the rich unless they're rich too.
 So we're gathering support for a private police department where the starting salary is $5 million a year.
 How's that going? Slowly.
 Even Tommy Hilfiger turned me down and you'd think that he, of all people, would understand the lower classes can ruin something.
 Plaxico Burress just called our idea "poorly thought out".
 Then hung up by shooting his own phone.
 This is a travesty.
 The wealthy were once the heart of New York.
 I just don't understand this city anymore.
 That's funny, because I may have just figured it out.
 [Laughs] I used to be like you, thinking I could make the city follow my rules.
 I told off line cutters and movie theater talkers.
 And for what? Did anyone cheer me, or name a sandwich after me that would maybe be Turkey, pastrami, Swiss, Russian dressing, Cole slaw and potato chips? You can't count on anyone else in this city, Jack.
 All you can do is sink down into the filth.
 [Clears throat] Or rise above it.
 If no one will help me, I'll do it myself.
 I'll remind New York of what she once was.
 Yes, a native American paradise! The greatest city on earth.
 A city that needs a leader who still believes in order and justice.
 Who'll shine a light into all the tunnels and police the police, who'll make this city into a beacon, lighting the way for an entire nation.
 Anyhoo, Tracy, in the dog boner sketch.
 I hereby officially announce my candidacy For the office of Mayor of the city of New York.
 Vote for Jack Donaghy.
 Slogan to come.
 You know if we got cloth place mats then we could just throw them in the laundry.
 Well, these vinyl ones say dishwasher safe, that's easy.
 Yeah, easy for the person who never does the dishes.
 [Both chuckle] What we're doing is so sick, right? How many times have you climaxed? Zero.
 Me too.
 Bathroom organizers! Oh! Good news for your campaign, J.
D.
 I got a huge list of voter names.
 Do you know anyone who wants to be called Daryl Weenus? I just registered the domain name for my campaign website Jack-Donaghy-is-running for-mayor-2013 new-York-this-is the-website.
Com.
 That's as close as I could get.
 Everything else was already pornography.
 I got everything on your list, Mr.
 Donaghy, fresh undershirts from Vattene, for your bar, and, just for fun, I also got you these goofy water balloons my mom's friend Ron used to always send me out to buy.
 Thank you, Kenneth.
 I know they're condoms.
 All right, Tracy, let's buckle down.
 Now that I've restocked, we never have to leave this office.
 Hang on have you not left this building since you were mugged? What? Uh, no, I've been very busy.
 What about your daughter? Liddy is at a baby leadership conference this week.
 The timing is perfect.
 I know what you're doing.
 The first time I got mugged, I didn't leave my room for a week.
 I hid, but not in a tuxedo.
 All I had was a Chewbacca costume made out of used hair extensions.
 It made me feel invincible.
 Like someone who wouldn't get scared and freeze up when they got mugged.
 Perfectly-executed Chewbacca sounds! That's why you won't take off that tuxedo, that's why you're running for mayor, and that's why you won't go outside.
 You're scared.
 The only thing I'm scared of is what's happening to this city.
 Then I'm gonna say to you what I say to all my sharks right before they die.
 Let's go outside.
 [Exhales] [Coughs] Oh, Jenna, I have a friend Yeah, well I have a million friends.
 I get so many birthday cards it's embarrassing.
 No, I have a "friend" who wants to freak out some new yorkers, and I know you and Paul disgust everyone.
 Oh, he and I are on a whole new level.
 This morning, Paul and I signed up for zipcar.
 Now it's easier to get to Costco to stock up on cereal.
 Lee, I need the old lady wig again.
 Oh, and get me that coat that Tracy's dog gave birth on.
 A Costco run, huh? You sound like me and Paula.
 No, Pete you don't understand.
 This is normalling.
 It's a weird sex thing.
 Paul and I do things like reboot the Internet and discuss whether the chair would be better Over by the window where there's more light? Yeah, that that's not a sex thing.
 That's just couple stuff.
 Hey, you and Paul should come by the house sometime.
 We'll have dinner, play scattergories.
 No, that's not what this is.
 You get away from me! [Evil voice] Scattergories.
 [Screams] [Coughs] Where? Where? Miss Lemon, are you okay? Oh, you smell like when the stone Mountain tire fire joined up with the corpse fire, and then swept through the downtown Manure district.
 It was our fault for letting those high schoolers dance at their prom.
 Oh, I'm better than okay, Kenneth.
 I'm going to the movies.
 But you're sick.
 I am sick.
 Sick like a fox.
 I'm gonna clear out that whole theater and watch a sneak peak of The hunger games by myself.
 It'll be my greatest triumph.
 There's a Q &amp; A afterwards with Eh, the screenwriter? Bleh.
 Miss Lemon, this isn't you.
 You love rules.
 Try to remember.
 Remember who you once were.
 What did the rules ever get me? The worst seat at the movies? A bunch of music that I paid for? A drawer full of leaky batteries that I don't know what to do with? Rules? There's only one rule now, Kenneth.
 Plastic cups go on the top rack of the dishwasher so they don't melt.
 Otherwise, no rules.
 [Ominous music]  Well, well, well.
 If isn't the tuxedo himself.
 Shouldn't you be outside, fixing the city? Well you look even closer to death than usual.
 What happened to you? Are you scared? The back of the "B" train certainly was.
 I had the whole car to myself.
 So this is you figuring out New York? Making the city worse for your own selfish ends? [Coughs] [Laughs] Is that your gym bag? Aren't you a human woman? It's these new microfibers.
 They keep you dry but it all has to go somewhere.
 So, today a subway car, tomorrow, what? All in good time, Jack.
 [Coughs] Will you take something for that cough already? I'd rather see if it gets better on it's own.
 Do you want me to go on my antibiotic rant? It's endless.
 You'll beg for death.
 There's a war going on out there.
 And you're gonna have to pick a side.
 I've always wanted to say that, and I can't believe I've wasted it on you.
 [Laughing, coughing] You've crossed a line, Lemon.
 Someone's gonna stop you.
 New York is gonna stop you.
 The old Liz would have agreed with you.
 But that was two days ago.
 Now, I don't cross lines, I just make 'em disappear.
 [Coughing] Hey, hon, I got your g-chat.
 Two exclamation points, huh? What's up? Paul, what if normalling isn't a fetish? What if we're just in another phase of our relationship and we're kind of Settling down? That's what one of my work colleagues said.
 That's just couple stuff.
 You know what, you and Jenna should come visit me and my wife in Montclair.
 But if Daryl Weenus is right, if we're just a couple, why don't we hate it? I don't know.
 I always imagined this kind of thing would make me wanna tear my hair out and rip my skin off.
 But with you, it feels as natural as Having someone tear your hair out and rip your skin off.
 I never thought this would happen to me, but I can actually imagine myself getting married, having kids.
 But is this really what we want? I don't know.
 What are you thinking? What are you thinking? Okay, we'll both say what we're thinking on the count of three.
 One two Both: Sexual walkabout.
 We spend the next three months alone, doing every depraved thing we can think of with as many people as we can and if this, right now, is still the happiest we can make ourselves, we'll stay together forever.
 Next stop, dinner and a private show.
 Gym bag, check.
 Tupperware vat of steamed broccoli, check.
 Talking to myself to seem crazy moo-goo! Wallet.
 No, not wow.
 Not when I'm so close.
 [Growls] Not enough time! My plan.
 [Grunts] Come on, Donaghy.
 You've skied Mount St.
 Helen's, made eye contact with Michelle Bachmann, been trapped under a Boulder for 128 hours.
 You're not scared of anything.
 Gimme $20! [Yelps] Lemon! [Groans] Oh, my tail bone.
 I just wanted to borrow movie money.
 You caught that lunatic that's been terrorizing the subway.
 The worst criminal in  N-Y-C Oh, my God, are you okay? That was awesome.
 You were so fast and strong.
 Thank you, Lemon.
 You're the only woman I could ever fight to regain my manhood.
 [All cheer and applaud] They're cheering you for stopping me.
 Old Liz was right.
 People do want rules! There's good in all of us, Lemon.
 Even you.
 So, are you still running for mayor? The city no longer needs me.
 For now.
 [All clap] Reminds me of us.
 I'll never forget the first time you dressed up like and old lady and I threw you into some garbage.
 Good-bye, my love.
 For now.
 New York City.
 Villains and heroes.
 The 1% and the 99.
 beautiful city, and I, Jenna Maroney, am going to go to town on every last one of them.
 [Mariachi music] [Singing in spanish]   

                




                    			Liz! Liz Lemon! It's me, Thad.
 From college.
 I've had my skin tags removed since then so you can see my eyes now.
 You ran the light board at the theater.
 Everyone called you Thad, no nickname.
 And you, you were the star The Sound of Music.
 Thank you, no everyone thinks of the young Nazi boy as the star of that show.
 A lot of people didn't realize that was the free, unlicensed version.
 Look, I know it's last minute, but I'm having an epic Leap Day party this afternoon.
 A daytime party celebrating Leap Day.
 Sounds fun, but I have to work.
 Hey, Liz, new Bluetooth? No, I'm talking to someone.
 I'm sorry.
 I don't see people that look like that.
 Sorry.
 That was this creep I went to college with.
 Such a nerd.
 And this is coming from someone who wrote lyrics to the song the cantina band playsin Star Wars.
 But, at least I don't throw Leap Day parties.
 Wait, that was Thad Warmald, the billionaire? No, that was sad Thad the skintag lad.
 I coined that.
 That name has been all over the gold digger message boards lately.
 I don't know a lot about business, but he did an Internet and now the computers like him and Wall Street is Google.
 Oh, my God.
 We are going to this party and you're introducing me to Thad.
 Liz, I'm on a sexual walkabout right now.
 I need to know if anything can make me happier than being with Paul.
 And maybe $20 billion would do it.
 What? How much Internet did he do? Poke your eye, pull your hair, you forgot what clothes to wear.
 What the hell? You're not wearing yellow and blue on Leap Day.
 So what? Leap Day is not a thing.
 What the crap is going on in here? Why, Leap Day William is visiting.
 Leap Day William? Miss Lemon, did you not grow up with Leap Day William? He lives in the Mariana trench.
 He emerges every four years to trade children's tears for candy? What? No.
 But white haven was founded by the amish, and we really only celebrated their holidays.
 After high school, I went on rumspringa.
 It was crazy.
 I totally snuck into The Witches of Eastwick.
 But where were you when we did this four years ago? Certainly not at a Michael's crafts crafting cruise.
 Miss Lemon, you are missing out.
 Every four years, you get a magical extra day.
 A day to do the things you ordinarily wouldn't do.
 To take chances! For instance, I am wearing a braided necklace with a shark's tooth on it.
 I listened to rap music for the first time.
 Not a fan.
 And you and I are going to a party thrown by a billionaire.
 Come on, take a leap, Liz.
 Okay, fine, I'll go, but if he has a giant chandelier in his house, I'm out.
 Those things fall.
 Waah, waah.
 S06 Ep09 Leap Day  Happy Leap Day, Lemon.
 Help yourself to some rhubarb.
 Rhubarb? Is white haven the only city in America that doesn't celebrate Leap Day? It's not such a big deal in Boston, either.
 Just a Leap Day William parade, citywide ice maze and, uh, we don't poke you in the eye if you're not wearing yellow and blue.
 We just, uh, stomp on your foot.
- Kick you in the knee, Yankees suck, go pats.
 I can't believe the woman who watches all six pawn shop reality shows has never seen the movie, Leap Dave Williams.
 I'm sorry, is Leap Dave Williams a play on Leap Day William? It's a classic.
 Uptight lawyer Dave Williams turns into the real Leap Day William after an ice fishing trip gone awry.
 USA runs an all day marathon.
 Dave, is everything all right? I definitely don't have gills.
 I mean, nothing.
 I mean, yes.
 Oh, my God, that's what Chris kept quoting this morning during our love making.
 New assistant reporting for duty.
 Kenneth's filling in.
 Gabe's got the weak off.
 He's a mormon.
 You know how they are about Leap Day.
 No, I don't, I don't know th Fine, I didn't wanna have to do this, but I am wearing yellow and blue.
 Kenneth, I'm hoping to find you a permanent position here at the company, but it's hard to take you seriously when you're dressed like that.
 I'm sorry, sir.
 I just get so excited spreading holiday cheer.
 Well, certainly you remember the joy that fills a young boy's heart on the day of leap.
 Don't get me wrong, I love this holiday.
 But do you know why? Sir, I never know why.
 Because it's an extra day to do business.
 A bonus profit opportunity.
 I have a bet with my business school roommates every four years to see who can make the most money on Leap Day.
 And that is why I am announcing today that cable town is purchasing Xaro, the 3-D Internet company.
 It'll be like those Bible quotes are right in your face.
 Yes, now take off that bald cap, Kenneth.
 We have a lot of work to do.
 Of course, take off my bald cap.
 Not put on my wig.
 Well, he's definitely rich.
 Look how lame this crowd is.
 Thad's been in his little nerd world for so long and now he's peeping out of his shell like a um, oh, what's that animal? You know, the one that crosses so slowly across the road and then you swerve to make sure you hit it and then a car coming the other way swerves to avoid you and goes off a cliff.
 And then that night you and your companion have the greatest sex of your lives because you're both sharing a secret.
 It's a turtle, Jenna.
 Yes, he's a turtle.
 And he's coming out of his shell for the first time.
 And when he does, he's gonna see this.
 We really gotta get all the furniture out of here? My aquarium guy's coming to see about turning this whole room into an aquarium.
 Who's really in the aquarium? The fish or us? Greetings, coworkers.
 Mr.
 Donaghy would like to inform you that, "unfortunately due to the Obama worldwide recession, "there will be no Leap Day bonuses this year.
 "Mean laughter, sound of a drink being poured.
 "What are you writing now, you slack-jawed donkey? What are all these letters, tray? It's just fan mail.
 I mean, would you read a bunch of letters from people who look up to me? A $50,000 benihana gift card? Right, I did an ad and insisted on being paid in beni bucks.
 No sir, this card is only good through February 2012.
 Any other year it'd be march already.
 But we found it today! It's a Leap Day miracle! Gentlemen, we have one day to eat $50,000 worth of Japanese food.
 That's impossible.
 Nothing's impossible on Leap Day.
 It's like I said in my cameo appearance in Leap Dave Williams, "gimme your wallet, old man!" Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce you to the future of Kabletown, the future of web-browsing, and, quite frankly, the future.
 Welcome to the age of 3-D Internet.
 Following an unintentionally racist press conference Help us to "Whip" the competition.
 Kabletown shares down sharply Careful, sir, those leaves are poisonous.
 You know the saying, "rhubarb red, eat away, rhubarb green, don't eat them.
" Kenneth, I've watched newt gingrich eat a plate of ribs.
 I think my stomach can handle some rhubarb leaves.
 Do you have any idea how long you'll be needing me today? One of my birds is sick and I want to get home in time to baptize her.
 We're both staying here until I come up with an idea to turn this day around.
 Now, would you watch a television show And I'm just spitballing here Called spitball? Sir, Rebecca Birdstein needs me.
 Kenneth, we all have to make sacrifices.
 Watch this.
 Sherry, I'm afraid something has come up at work and you'll have to stay late with Liddy.
 Just dab some scotch on your neck and make your eyes the color of a winter crystal so she'll think you're me.
 Thank you Sherry.
 Good night.
 How many rooms are in It's my, uh, d&amp;d room.
 The gaming table comes up out of the floor.
 Table! Frak, I'm supposed to say "floor" first.
 Forget it, damn it! This is all for you, Liz.
 What? I have been in love with you since college.
 Watching you every night on that stage and realizing my dad was wrong.
 I do like girls.
 Oh, boy.
 Okay.
 The party, the New York apartment, everything.
 Do you know why I spun off Xaro and sold it to Kabletown? Just so I could accidentally run into you.
 That is why it's called Xaro.
 In Game of Thrones, Xaro is a rich merchant prince who wishes to acquaint himself with the mother of dragons.
 Great, well Scooby Doo! Liz, wait! $10 million! I want you to take my virginity on leap night for $10 million.
 Fine, 20.
 No, Thad, I Don't answer yet.
 I mean, okay, unless you were gonna say yes.
 No, you heard me say no.
 Don't answer yet.
 Don't answer yet.
 Come  on.
 Son of a glub.
 Mr.
 Jordan, you'll never spend all this by midnight.
 You appeared in that ad for nothing.
 Well the joke's on you because that commercial never aired for unexplained reasons.
 I just touched the table again.
 God, you call for help! I'll just put my head on the table for a second.
 Now let's get started, bring us a bottle of your finest wine.
 Of course, Mr.
 Jordan.
 That will be $12.
 Hey, Liz.
 I can't find Thad.
 Thad just indecentproposal-ed me.
 One night, $20 million.
 My God, that's the gold digger's dream.
 Where is he? No, Jenna.
 You don't understand.
 He's been in love with me since college.
 He only wants me.
 And you're still here.
 You're considering it.
 Liz, you know you're not doing this.
 I'm on a sexual walkabout.
 But you're a nice girl with a live-in boyfriend.
 Honey, I'm about to do something pretty crazy.
 You should.
 It's Leap Day.
 Real life is for march.
 No, just hear me out.
 Because if this doesn't work It doesn't matter.
 Nothing that happens on Leap Day counts.
 Nothing that happens on Leap Day counts.
 Well, then, here goes nothing.
 Hey, Liz, what's up? Criss, I'm about to do something pretty crazy.
 You should, it's Leap Day.
 Real life is for march.
 Oh, boy.
 No, hear me out, because this could really ruin No, it doesn't matter.
 Nothing that happens on Leap Day counts.
 Hey, listen, I gotta run, but whatever it is, go for it.
 My.
 It looks like we've got a slut-off on our hands.
 We've only spent $6000.
 We should just give up.
 Never.
 We can't keep eating! Lutz's shirt button popped off and hit Cerie.
 It counts as us touching.
 This is important.
 Everybody's always telling me not to get paid in gift cards.
 Angie, my lawyer, my imaginary friend, Dotcom.
 Tray, I'm real.
 I moved your furniture.
 And, yeah, Leap Day has become too commercial.
 And people have forgotten what it really means, but I remember.
 One Leap Day when I was a kid, the Harlem River froze, and I decided to cross it carrying my brick collection.
 I told him not to.
 No one can hear you, Dotcom.
 Then I fell through the ice.
 They still don't know who pulled me out.
 I did.
 Charlie Rangel gave me a medal.
 I like to think it was Leap Day William.
 You really believe in Leap Day William? I used to.
 Then I tried to eat all this benihana.
 Now I don't know anymore.
 I gotta take a walk.
 Do some thinking.
 But I can explain.
 I'm Leap Day Williams! No, really! Please, believe me.
 Have a little faith.
 Boy.
 I'm getting sleepy.
 You're famous.
 I have screen grabs of all your nip s.
 You know what, Thad? I was trying to remember.
 What was the dance that Rolf did for Liesl? Did it go like this? Yes.
 That's it.
 That's how Rolf danced.
 Why don't you go and get me and Liz some drinks? Very well.
 Liz, a moment, please? If you're really gonna do this, you better get a move on.
 Right now, there are models waking up from their coke binges, multi-ethnic bartenders with daddy issues, former ballerinas who had to quit because their boobs got too big.
 They're gonna hear about the horny billionaire, and Thad's gonna forget all about his little crush.
 They're coming Liz.
 Click click.
 That's their stilettos.
 Click click.
 Sir? Sir, you don't look so good.
 You shouldn't have eaten those rhubarb leaves.
 I can't be sick.
 I won't lose money on Leap Day.
 I'm just gonna rest a second.
 Please get better, sir.
 I've dug too many graves.
 Why the long face, son? I do have a long, elegant face, thank you, but I can't enjoy your compliment, because I'm sad.
 I'm starting to think Leap Day William isn't even real.
 I reckon you may be right.
 Leap Day William's probably just a tall tale told to kids to help sell candy.
 But this old fool still believes he exists, right here, inside all of us.
 I am always coughing up blood.
 Could that be Leap Day William trying to get out? Might could be, but I think if he were here right now, Leap Day William would tell you everything's gonna be all right, Tracy, as long as you remember where you come from.
 Thanks.
 Nice costume, by the way.
 Right, costume.
 So, what should we do now? Stop pressuring me.
 What are you? An intercourse monster? I'm sorry.
 I'm nervous.
 Is sex like when the Na'vi intertwine their hair braids? Sure.
 Yeah, Thad, that's exactly what it's like.
 Okay, look, if we're gonna do this, we kinda need to do it now, okay, before No.
 Aw, damn it.
 Hot bitches.
 Wake up, sir! Wake up.
 What is this? Kenneth, is that me? I'm not Kenneth.
 I'm the spirit of Leap Day.
 Welcome to your Leap Day past.
 Jackie, we can't go to the parade today.
 I got called into work at the hospital where I'm a nurse.
 Why are you showing me this? This is the kind of adversity that made me the man I am today.
 Good.
 Cry.
 Let your sadness form a hole inside you that can only be filled with money.
 Of course we're going to the parade today, Jackie.
 But you can't have candy and cigarettes without a few tears first.
 How did I forget this part? And when did we stop giving children cigarettes? It's the liberal war on Leap Day.
 It's time to go, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Welcome to Leap Day present.
 Okay, I'll change me eye color, but it seem like a waste of voodoo.
 Good night, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Sorry, baby.
 Daddy not coming home tonight because of work.
 It's a good lesson.
 This will help her in life.
 Are you sure? Welcome to the future.
 Five leap days from now.
 That's Liddy.
 I assume this is her horse stable and that she's hammering that nail as a funny joke.
 No, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 She's doing habitat for humanity.
 After you missed all her leap days, she started experimenting with liberalism.
 That's not her.
 It can't be.
 What have you done with my daughter? Where is Liddy? She's at home, sir.
 With the nanny.
 There's still time.
 Kenneth, I want you to go to citarella and buy the biggest rhubarb there is.
 The one that's as big as me, sir? That's the one.
 But first, you take Rebecca Birdstein to the vet.
 What a Mitzvah.
 Merry Leap Day, sir.
 Merry Leap Day to us all! Liz, why don't you go and Get you and Karolina some drinks? Okay, fine.
 Looks like this time the male will be in the Czech.
 That kind of wit is a thing she will never give you.
 Hey, Liz, a gym teacher on a sex tour of Indonesia called.
 He wants his shirt back.
 Okay, that's solid, Kurkova.
 That's a good burn.
 What was that old man trying to tell me? What am I gonna do with all this free food? Remember where I came from.
 But we all came from the sea.
 Sea? Like the letter "C", which is part of the alphabet.
 Alphabet soup.
 Soup kitchen.
 Kitchen No, no, don't keep going.
 The kitchen debate with Richard Nixon.
 Richard M.
 Nixon.
 The M-train.
 Soul train.
 Chicken soup for the soul.
 Chicken soup.
 Soup kitchen.
 This is a Leap Day miracle! Merry Leap Day, tourists.
 Merry Leap Day, closeted gay guys meeting in the city.
 Really? Seriously 20 million bucks? I would sleep with Thad Warmald for that.
 Couldn't go through with it.
 You know, I just kept seeing your face.
 Also, I have too much dignity.
 So another woman? Victoria's secret model.
 Feast, homeless, feast! I saved Leap Day! And connected with my son! And I solved the big case from earlier! Merry Leap Day, everybody! Hey! Take a leap, pal! That's the spirit! Happy Leap Day, sweetheart.
 Yes! Well, I guess we all learned something tonight about love and friendship, about taking chances, about the true meaning of Leap Day.
 But, these lessons aren't good just for every four years.
 No.
 They're good every year.
 Because we should live every day as if it's Leap Day, and every Leap Day as if it's your last.
 And if you should ever see an old man in a blue suit busting out of the middle of the ocean, take the time to say howdy.
 It might just be worth your while.
    

                




                    			There she is! Whore of whores! My Frankie could have any woman on earth, and he chose you? Ma! What are you doing here? Why can't you just be happy that I'm happy With Liz? Can I just say one sentence? Dio mio,i'm an old fool.
 What is wrong with me? My boy's in love! Come over for dinner.
 Tonight.
 Do you like ox, Liz? I'll defrost an ox for you.
 Look, if the situation was reversed, you know I'd pretend to be your boyfriend.
 I have a boyfriend.
 In Canada.
 Seriously.
 Chris is in Canada for the week.
 And I can't be your girlfriend, 'cause I'm not an old pedophile.
 We prefer the term adultophobe.
 Lynn, what is going on here? Well, I'm hiding from Sylvia.
 I got really good at hiding in prison and making wine in my toilet.
 Does your mom not know you guys are together? It's been a year.
 Sylvia doesn't approve of me.
 No one can remember why anymore.
 You were his teacher, and you seduced him.
 Look, here's what happened.
 My mom was snooping in my room, 'cause she loves me, and she found a letter.
 Look what I found in your pornography collection A love letter.
 Who sent this to you? Who is "L"? So you told her "L" was me? Liz, we just need you to go along with this until I don't know, my mom dies.
 Or I die.
 No.
 I'm not helping to protect this.
 It's creepy.
 This is creepy? In prison, I was part of a fake family with a bald woman, and our son was a basketball with a wig on it, but okay.
 This is creepy.
 Frank, tell your mother the truth, 'cause living a lie will eat you up inside.
 Like that parasite I got from eating Sushi on AmTrak.
 S01 Ep.
 10 Alexis Goodlooking and the Case of the Missing Whisky That's quite a suit, Kenneth.
 Thank you, sir.
 All my suits are my late father's Mr That's weird.
 Kenneth, since you've left the page program, finding you a new position here has been one of the most difficult challenges of my career.
 And I'm including making it through the '80s without having sex with Belinda Carlisle.
 I know, sir, but I just couldn't work in ad sales.
 We have far too many sponsors that make housework easier for women.
 That's why I'm putting you in the standards department.
 You'll be responsible for keeping the airwaves free of content that might offend any group.
 It's a good starting place, but Kenneth, if you wanna make it in the business world, you can't be so Morally stubborn.
 There are gray areas.
 No, sir.
 There's always a right and wrong.
 Before he died, my father gave me a piece of advice.
 "Son, if you wanna get ahead in this world Oh, God, this hurts Tell your mother I'm gay.
" Nerf rifle.
 Mass Effect 3.
 What else do we need for, uh, research? Well, I need the deutsche grammophon box set for my opera sketch.
 An opera? Is there singing? Because I sing.
 Tracy doesn't sing, so I should do it.
 The audience expects it.
 I'll sleep with you.
 No, Jenna, none of this stuff is really for sketches.
 We're just saying that so we can charge it all to the show.
 It's the perfect crime As long as Pete never finds out.
 Who drank this? This is the scotch I was saving for my birthday.
 Someone with a key to my office, a janitor or a security guard or some black Hearted individual, probably white, has ruined the Hornberger hang for all of us! Let's get forensics in here.
 Have the techs lift a latent print, and run it against AFIS.
 Maybe the perp's in the system.
 J-Mo, you sound like a cop, and I should know.
 My Uncle was a cop In a porno.
 Tracy, every blond actress in the business has done a pilot about a tough but pretty lady cop with special abilities.
 Mine was called goodlooking.
 I played Alexis goodlooking who was also good-looking, and my special ability was being good at looking for clues.
 Let's get forensics in here.
 Have the techs lift a latent print, and run it against AFIS.
 Maybe the perp's in the system.
 Unlike my husband's killer, who got away, and it haunts me.
 You know what? We should use your skills to solve the case of Pete's missing booze.
 That was a long time ago, Tracy.
 My detective days are over.
 You sure about that? Because like all black actors, I have a lot of experience with playing a wise black fellow who gets reluctant white people to do things.
 Well I'm just an old fool, of course, and I don't know much about politics or the like.
 But I do know America's kinda like this here crab apple tree John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
 All right, I'll do it.
 Let's ride, partner.
 I have some real problems with this We can't say "dick wolf" on TV.
 Listen up, standards and practices.
 I just had an emergency meeting with legal, and we can no longer use the words "hit, great show, fun," or "broadcast television.
" Now, Kenneth Mr.
 Donaghy, Bradley Tarkin, junior compliance associate.
 We met last year at your completely silent presentation on the power of eye contact.
 Yes.
 I believe it was entitled I was just an intern then, but afterwards, I got you to sign my first edition Jack attack.
 You know, the first edition has a typo.
 When I took over microwaves, I said to the team, "by the end of this quarter, "we're all gonna be in the black comma guys.
" Not, "we're all gonna be in the black guys.
" Anyway, nice to meet you again, Bradley.
 Kenneth, a word.
 Balloon! Kenneth, you are now officially in the business world.
 Bradley is trying to destroy you.
 Destroy me? He's the best friend I've ever had, tied with everyone I've ever met.
 Kenneth, if you learn one thing from me, it's this: In business, you have no friends.
 Let me tell you a little story.
 There was once a man named Henry Warren.
 Henry pretended to be my friend, but he turned out to be my very first Nemesis.
 We got the contract! We're gonna make the bottles for new coke.
 And I'm gonna make sure you get all the credit.
 Aces! Let's do some cocaine.
 My friendship with Henry was a lie.
 We were just waiting for the chance to destroy the other one.
 But Bradley gave me my nickname.
 "Susan.
" Like "lazy Susan," 'cause I'm lazy and effeminate.
 Bradley is dangerous.
 Last year he was an intern.
 Now he's a junior compliance associate.
 How did he get promoted so quickly? I signed his book.
 He had my signature.
 He probably put it on a forged letter of recommendation.
 Sir.
 That's awfully paranoid.
 Exactly.
 "Paranoid," from the Greek "para" meaning "beside," and "noid," which is some sort of a Pizza demon! No, that can't be right.
 The point is, you've got to be paranoid, Kenneth.
 You've gotta go in there and crush Bradley like I crushed Henry Warren.
 But I've never crushed anyone except accused witches.
 Get in there! Be cool, be cool, be cool.
 How did you get in here? Frank said you couldn't come to dinner because you weren't feeling well.
 But I know the best thing for a fever is food, wine, and cheek pinching! So I packed everything up, prayed to the patron Saint of locked apartments, and here we are.
 No.
 Absolutely n You don't have a say in this! Now, lie down.
 While I'm here, you do nothing.
 As we say in Italy Eat an arancine.
 I love our little family.
 Pete? Yeah, I saw him earlier today.
 Why? Something wrong? Someone drank his scotch.
 You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Why would I? I was gonna drink it with him on his birthday.
 Okay, but if you think of anything, use this phone as a reminder to call us.
 I may not pick up, 'cause I lost my phone just now.
 If you think of anything, call us.
 Hang on.
 This chair's been moved.
 Read him his rights.
 I should tell my husband I'm gonna be late tonight.
 No, wait, I can't.
 He's dead.
 Hang on.
 The trash was moved.
 Hiding something, Mr.
 Lutz? Okay.
 I drank it.
 We all drank it.
 We wanted booze, but we didn't wanna hang out with Pete.
 It's the worst! He always brings out his guitar and sings.
 He's got one story, and it's about him seeing Phil Donahue at a mall.
 Now comes the worst part.
 The paperwork.
 What's wrong, Susan? Mr.
 Pfister just took me to the woodshed, which I didn't even realize could be a metaphor.
 I guess I signed off on a script where an Asian character refers to "Rindsay Rohan" posing for "Prayboy.
" But I know that's very offensive.
 Especially because asians are under-represented on this network.
 Exactly.
 If there are more actors of Asian descent Shut up! Just shut up, Roy! I am talking to Kenneth.
 I'm dealing with something! No one wants to hear from you.
 I don't even remember reading that script.
 It's your signature on the memo.
 That does look like my "X.
" Susan, as a friend, quit before they fire you.
 Your meatballs are good! Like Ikea good! Is there parmesan in this? And Lemon.
 And a little fennel? Are you sure you're not Italian, Liz? Maybe from the North? That's where the vampires used to live.
 What's the matter, Frank? You're so quiet! You're sitting at dinner next to a beautiful older woman.
 Eat something and kiss her! No! I can't do this.
 Ma, Liz isn't the "L" in that letter.
 It's Lynn Onkman.
 Elizabeth, I'm gonna ask you to leave.
 But this is my I don't think Bradley's my friend.
 I hate to say, "told ya," because it reminds me of my one-night stand with Nikki finke.
 He's trying to get me fired.
 What do I do? Pray for a body switch mix-up so we can see the world from each other's perspectives? No.
 You destroy him.
 With this.
 I did some research.
 And unlike what he wrote on his application, Bradley never graduated from Syracuse.
 He's four credits shy of a degree in bro studies.
 You slip this transcript under your manager's door, and he's fired.
 No! I can't do that.
 It's wrong! If you don't get him, he gets you.
 And that little snake keeps slithering up the corporate ladder instead of a good man like yourself.
 Kenneth, sometimes you've gotta get your hands dirty for the good of company And country.
 My two favorite kinds of music.
 Hey, everybody's just sitting around in there waiting for you two to shoot promos.
 Thank God I've got my awesome Phil Donahue story.
 Pete, there's been a development in the whiskey case.
 What? No! Forget the whiskey! Look, all I wanted to do was hang with my friends, rock some jams, and tell the story about my cousin seeing Phil Donahue.
 I mean me! I-I'm the one who saw him.
 We just wanted to tell you We don't know what happened to your whiskey.
 What was that? He doesn't need to know how it went down.
 It would hurt him too much.
 I broke the number one rule of being on the force.
 Don't fall in love with your car? No.
 I let it get personal.
 You're right.
 The car thing is stupid.
 The thing is, the writers got away with it.
 So what are we gonna do about it? We're goin' rogue.
 Hey.
 Sorry about last night.
 Yeah.
 I had to sleep here.
 You know, they turned the heat off.
 If I hadn't found that other blanket, I'd Wait, where'd it go? Oh, God.
 It was mice! The blanket was mice! So what happened with Sylvia? You were right, Liz.
 Lying to my mom was stressing me out.
 I mean, I haven't gained weight in months.
 It wasn't worth it.
 So what, you broke up with Lynn? Just promise me Here.
 That you'll take care of yourself.
 Don't let Liz work you too hard.
 I do really hate her.
 I think she's a terrible person.
 First of all, why were you in my bedroom, and why would you tell me that part of the conversation? It's the only part where we weren't having break-up sex.
 Come on! Look, I'm sorry.
 And I appreciate everything you did, so I made you some meatballs.
 It's my mom's recipe.
 So you're sure you're okay? Yeah.
 Definitely.
 With all this behind me, I'm happy.
 Thanks.
 Eat them now! Quiet.
 I do the talking.
 Henry.
 Henry Warren? Henry Warren-Chang.
 I married a very bossy Chinese lady.
 What on earth are you doing here? Please, sit down.
 Thank you.
 I haven't seen you since the 1985 G.
E.
 talent show when I convinced you to sing Monster mash, knowing full well that Jack Welch is terrified of monsters, and I ended your career.
 Not "ended.
" Doing quite well, actually.
 In publishing now.
 Encyclopedias.
 I wanted to stop by because a young man named Kenneth parcell came to my office this afternoon.
 He did? What did he want? He wanted to find out if my life turned out okay after you took me down.
 Because he's afraid he might have to do the same thing to someone else.
 And what did you tell him? I told him the truth.
 I'm great.
 I lease a certified pre-owned lexus, both my sons are magicians, and for my birthday, wei-lin got me tickets to the Broadway show Memphis.
 So- And I see that you've done very well for yourself.
 Well, that sofa is made from sea biscuit.
 Well We're both very impressive.
 But at what cost, Jack? The first couple months that we worked together, we were good friends, and then we turned against each other and Come on, Henry.
 We were never friends.
 We were pretending so we could learn each other's weaknesses and then Exploit them.
 But what about all the dinners? I mean, we talked for hours.
 I was gathering information.
 All right.
 What about the drive up to pittsfield when we stopped at sturbridge village? Remember? We had fun.
 We saw a candle being made.
 I didn't really care about that candle, Henry.
 I don't even remember what color it was.
 Regular white-tan candle color, Jack! You know what? I really feel sorry for Kenneth parcell, because you're gonna beat all that's good out of him and turn him into another paranoid corporate killer.
 I remember our trip to Hilton head.
 That wasn't me! Take a sit 'cause no one is going anywhere! We know you all drank Pete's scotch So here's how we're gonna play it.
 You're gonna hang out with Pete every night this week.
 Why would we do that? 'Cause we have you dead to rights, you black bastard! And if you don't play along, we tell Pete about your little scam How the show's been paying for your video games and nerf rifles and pornography.
 That's right! We know you ordered a porn version of Temple Grandin entitled ten poles rammed in.
 You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
 Let's get outta here, Maroney.
 The sight of these people plus the crayons I ate earlier make me sick.
  Sing us a song, you're the guitar man   and this is Pete's birthday night  Any mysteries that need solving, Liz? Actually, yes.
 What happened? Who attacked you and gave you that haircut? No, it's these meatballs.
 They don't taste right.
 There's an extra ingredient.
 It's something familiar.
 P.
S.
 I love you is so sad.
 No one should have to be married to Gerard Butler.
 Or hilary swank! It's tears! Frank was crying when he made these.
 He lied! He's miserable.
 But I don't understand.
 He seemed so happy earlier.
 Forget it, Tracy.
 It's midtown.
 Kenneth, don't do it.
 You can't destroy Bradley, you innocent goon.
 You're the most remarkable person I know, and I've met jaleel White.
 Incredibly charismatic.
 He makes Stefan urquelle look like Steve urkel.
 But my career.
 Forget about your career.
 I'd rather see you get fired and lease a car than watch you turn into someone like me.
 Now, give me that transcript.
 So you're trying to help me.
 Of course I am, Kenneth.
 I'm your friend.
 It's just the other day you said in business I have no friends, and you were right about Bradley, so what does that say about you? Maybe you're afraid I will become you.
 I'll climb that corporate ladder until I eventually take your job.
 And then where will you be? Out on your ass like stone Mountain's mailman riding his trusty donkey erasmus.
 That is some high-level paranoid thinking.
 Like Hitler Or Willy wonka.
 If you're thinking that way, then I'm already too late.
 Why are you keeping me late to write the cold open? Well, you know politics.
 I don't know anything.
 I get all my news from the radio in Grand Theft Auto.
 Frankie! Are you okay? La Donna di scoregge called and said you were sick, so I came by to make you chicken soup.
 Where can I kill this? Wait Liz called you? No.
 She called me.
 You! How dare you? Get out of my Liz's office.
 You said Frank wanted to get back together.
 Why would you tell her that? I said I was happy.
 You lied you're miserable.
 You cried in my food! Sylvia, your son is not sick.
 And Lynn, Frank didn't actually say that he wanted to get back together.
 So I wore my sexy underwear for nothing? I'll kill you! Ma'am, I am in a Mexican prison gang.
 You kill me, Los Tiberones will green-light a 1-8-7 on you, and you don't want that kind of heat.
 Sylvia, your son is not happy.
 And not that you care, but neither is Lynn.
 That's true.
 When Liz called me, I was getting this tattoo.
 I'm not creative.
 And believe me, I get it.
 This shouldn't work.
 I mean, how they met is disgusting.
 Their age difference is just weird.
 They shouldn't go together.
 But you know what else shouldn't go together? Veal, fennel, lemon, cheese, and pork.
 That's right.
 Your meatballs.
 Lynn and Frank Are just as good as your meatballs.
 That's it? We're meatballs? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
 Do you have any idea what I've been through for love? Public humiliation.
 Johnny Carson in his monologue said I was looking at 20 years, but I'd probably be more attracted to 12.
 I mean, that's an okay joke, but it hurt.
 And then prison, where we only had one movie with dabney Coleman and the kid from E.
 T.
? Cloak &amp; Dagger? Shut up, Liz.
 I lost my house, my life, but it has all been worth it.
 I mean, even if I never see Frank again, it was worth it.
 And you call us meatballs! Elizabeth, I'm gonna ask you to leave.
 Okay, but if you look at my Internet history, I'm researching a movie about two male centaurs kissing.
 I was wrong.
 This isn't creepy because you're dating your teacher.
 This is creepy because you're dating your mother.
 You found someone just like me because I'm the woman you really wanna be with! 'Cause you're the best! Frankie, you're the best.
 My big family.
  And Phil Donahue's walking past cinnabon   and he's making eye contact with me   I can tell by his smile that he'll stay for a while   and say, "Pete, you're who I wanna be"  Well, maybe I never did go to college or travel around the world.
 So I don't know much about worldly things like taco meat and having all your fingers.
 Lord knows some of my friends are just shrubs I put hats on and get high with.
 My wife had two of the president's babies, and you're one of 'em.
 I can tell you one thing I'm gonna kill all y'all in y'all sleep.
 Now, I don't know nothing about no literature or history, but I'll tell you what I do know.
 This movie was written by white nerds.
 Cut!   

                




                    			 Well, hello, Hank.
 So good of you to come up.
 Well, I'm not gonna miss the America's Kidz got singing finale.
 Last time I was this excited was this morning.
 I saw a cat wearing the same sweater as its person.
 Jack, you remember my granddaughter.
 Hi, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 Kaylie.
 There's Jenna Marone.
 So, Jack, how's your wife? Still kidnapped? How's the yearbook going? I heard you made editor Of the photo captions.
 Pop-Pop, wait up.
 Pop-Pop, wait up.
 I'm so excited for the finale.
 Not that it matters, even if Brock doesn't win, he is going to get a record contract.
 So, it definitely doesn't matter.
 This isn't the last we will be seeing of Brock.
 Well, whoever wins, it's a great night for the industry.
 Kidz is a hit the whole family can watch together, not your usual sitcom crap full of gratuitous vulgarity and pratfalls.
 My penis! Jenna, this is a big night.
 And I've got something big planned.
 Tonight during the finalists' duet, I'm gonna cry.
 Now, of course, none of these little condom accidents could actually make me cry, so I'm gonna rub this under my eyes to help me fake it.
 It's an old acting trick I learned from Glenn Beck's prostitute.
 Well, mark my words, Jenna, tonight is going to be the greatest.
 Disaster in the history of television.
 The young contestants apparently inebriated on live TV.
 I gotta throw up.
 What happened? Why haven't you been returning my calls? Because my phone melted last night, Lemon.
 Come here, Jack.
 That was my angriest hug, 'cause that's how I feel right now.
 Instead of heading back to Philadelphia, I'm going down to deal with the FCC.
 The Federal Clown Commission.
 I hope that comes off as respectful.
 My father was a clown, and I know how hard those men work.
 I'm going to get to the bottom of what happened last night, sir.
 I've already detained Brock and Ava under the patriot act.
 People have forgotten about that thing, but any white male can arrest any other person.
 Hello, peers.
 Sure has been a busy morning down in the Standards department.
 Because of last night's cluster-whoops, Darren was fired.
 Then he threatened to come back with a gun.
 Then I got a promotion, and the desk closest to the door.
 Here are my new business cards.
 Late night programming? So you're covering TGS now? And a wonderful new show from D.
L.
 Hughley that's already been canceled! I feel like Oscar the grouch today, and not just 'cause I woke up in a garbage can this morning, startling someone named Gordon.
 What's wrong, Tracy? I can't eat for 24 hours 'cause I have a colonoscopy tomorrow.
 I'm starving! You know, fasting can actually clear your mind.
 In college, I once went on a hunger strike to protest apartheid You're the one who solved that? Thank you so much.
 what are you doing here? What? Jenna! Save it, Liz.
 Yes, I was disappointed that I didn't get to do my fake cry, but I do have a plan B.
 The whole point of the cry was to humanize me, to change public perception, but what else humanizes a monster? Motherhood.
 God.
 Don't adopt.
 That child is better off in Somalia.
 It could be a pirate, or a warlord's concubine.
 This is better than adopting.
 Remember my little moneymaking scheme back in Chicago? Cashing your dead aunt's social security checks? No, I'm still doing that.
 I'm talking about when I donated my eggs.
 So, a couple of months ago, I called the calumet city egg donation center and house of blues to see if there were any little Jennas out there who wanted to meet me.
 Hang on, are you saying you have a kid? No, I don't.
 I have six kids.
 Jerome, share the bronzer, you slut.
 Dear God.
 S06 Ep 11 Standards and Practices  I'm a very powerful man, Brock.
 Little league tryouts are coming soon.
 How would you like to wind up on a team with None of your friends? It was her idea! She made me do it! Brock just sold you out, Ava.
 What are you doing to Molly? She already had to live through world war ii.
 Brock said it was all your idea.
 No, it was her idea.
 She's just so cool.
 Like a human silly band! Who? Who's a human silly band? I'm tall enough now that there isn't a roller coaster in the world I can't go on.
 So You guys drink beer.
 Or are you babies? Jack versus Kaylie, round two, colon No subtitle necessary.
 Mommy announcement.
 I hope we're all waxed, because you're coming with me to my interview tonight for Barbara Walters' 10 most overexposed people.
 Barbara Walters! Okay, so, let me just quickly identify everyone's good sides.
 Left, left, right, right, left Judy.
 That's not really on message.
 Look, I didn't call the donation center to be on TV, Jenna.
 I wanted to go get a cup of coffee and get to know you.
 If you want to get to know me, read my 2006 interview in AmTrak magazine.
 If you want to be my daughter, put on this wig and smile.
 There you are, liierz.
 Boy, I am still not comfortable calling you by your first name.
 Then again, you've never been comfortable calling me by my full Christian name.
 Kenneth.
 No, "Kenneth" is short for andromakennethamblesorton.
 So, what's up? Wait, what is this? "Additional restrictions to broadcast standards"? Yes.
 People are pretty upset about last night.
 How can we do "Fart doctor" without the word "fart"? I'm surprised they allow you to say "doctor.
" It's so close to "gynecologist" which is disgusting.
 Have you seen this memo from Standards? Kenneth is being a real dingbat, which is now the harshest word we are allowed to say.
 You can blame that on Kaylie Hooper.
 She's the one who ruined the Kidz finale.
 Really? What a dingbat.
 Why didn't I see this coming? I knew this company was making me lose my edge.
 That's why I hired a Cato to attack me at random.
 Like inspector clouseau.
 Cato? Don't attack me tonight, okay? I know I told you that when I say, "don't attack me," that's when I most need you to attack me, but I'm serious.
 Cato? Excellent, Cato, excellent! Did Kaylie really think I wouldn't figure this out? No, she knew I would.
 So, she's going to be ready for me.
 Good.
 I like a fair fight.
 Okay, she is just a teenage girl.
 Lemon, you know very well that a Nemesis can be anyone Or anything.
 Autocorrect.
 I was trying to say "pen organizer.
" God! You're a winter! I don't know what that means.
 Why are there only six chairs out there? There's seven of us.
 No.
 One of us will have to sit out the interview.
 I'm just gonna choose at random who it's gonna be.
 Eenie-meenie-miney-moe, out goes  y-o-u I'm sorry, Judy.
 Bye, Judy.
 Could've just gotten another chair.
 Who is it? Sweetie, it's Pop-Pop.
 I came back from D.
C.
 early, and I lost my darn key.
 What a world.
 Surprise.
 I'm very good at voices, Kaylie.
 I'm very good.
 I know what you did.
 And you had to assume I'd break Brock and Ava, so, you're ready for this, but here's what you weren't counting on This has nothing to do with you! I just had to get Pop-Pop out of town because I am in so much trouble! Henry and his friends had to go to the King of Prussia mall last Thursday night 'cause it was a half day, and I couldn't go 'cause I had piano, and my friend Vickie, well, she said she got grounded 'cause she went to some highlighter party with Dylan while his parents were out of town.
 Okay, hang on.
 Calm down.
 And then fat Vickie saw her there, so I called her, and Henry answered her phone because he had Vickie's phone! Wait, which Vickie? Fat Vickie? Vickie P.
 Are you even listening to me? Okay.
 God! Vickie used to be my best friend.
 I had her youface password, so I logged onto her account, and posted all these photos with "I am a slut" written on her forehead, and then school found out, so now my life is over! Please! What does this have to do with sabotaging me? This has nothing to do with you! I messed up the show to make sure Pop-Pop wouldn't come back to Philadelphia with me, 'cause Dr.
 Melvoin is trying to kick me out of school, and if Pop-Pop comes to the teacher conference, well, then, he'll let them expel me, and I'll have to go to some school in the middle of nowhere, and then I might as well be dead! Wait, where are your parents? Who knows? My mom is in Indonesia visiting her charity where poor children make shoes.
 Isn't that just a sweat shop? I know! And then my dad put a Porsche engine in a model T and drove it to Mardi Gras! I know what it's like not to have your parents around.
 I once took a log with googly eyes to a father-son picnic.
 But, uh, who's going to take you to this parent-teacher conference? I don't know.
 I have nobody! I wanna die! Do you have a second, Kenneth? No, there's only one of me.
 What? What are you asking? Look, we have a show tonight.
 You can't just take away all these words we've been using for the past six years.
 That reminds me.
 You can't say "using" on TV.
 It implies drug use.
 We're saying whatever we want.
 No, you can't.
 That's an order.
 I stole that speech from an episode JAG, but it applies here.
 Are you kidding me? Last week you were a page, now you're telling me how to run my show? Well, I am arguing back at you.
 I have enough crap to deal with around here, Kenneth I'm interrupting you 'cause I'm good at arguing! I don't need you to make my life worse.
 I am responding, I am matching your tone, and making my own point.
 You know what, Kenneth? Fine.
 You win.
 But as we saw the other night on Kidz, anything can happen on live TV.
 Right, Tracy? What? I'm just saying, Tray, you're very unpredictable.
 And we'll write clean sketches, but you might just do your stand-up act.
 Who knows? Okay.
 I'm still fasting because I misread my calendar.
 Tomorrow is my colonoscopy.
 Today was my meeting with Colin o'Scopy.
 Therefore, I have no idea what you're saying, talking Turkey leg.
 Were you a difficult teenager? Well, I was voted head of the PTA, so no.
 I'm accustomed to dealing with difficult people, Lemon, but teenage girls, ugh Are a puzzle.
 Yes, how was your meeting with your Nemesis? I volunteered to accompany Kaylie to a parent-teacher conference at her school.
 What? Why? It's complicated.
 The point is, and I never thought I'd say this, I actually feel badly for Kaylie.
 On the other hand, I know full well that this is an opportunity to destroy her.
 I could get her expelled, sent off to some second-rate boarding school, then on to that last bastion of the incompetent rich, USC.
 I don't know, Jack, you should stay out of this.
 No, I could help this girl.
 Or destroy this monster.
 If I could just tell whether she's vicious or vulnerable.
 That's the problem.
 She's a teenage girl.
 She's vicious and vulnerable.
 She might be completely lying, like when I was 15 and told everyone at my school that I'd already gotten my period, or she could be in real trouble, like when I was 17, and finally got my period at a very loosely supervised petting zoo.
 Once again, Lemon, I leave your office more confused than when I entered, but having glimpsed yet another tile in the rich mosaic that is your menstrual history.
 So bravo wants to do a reality show about us, and I thought the opening credits could be all of us in a giant dog bed, and you guys are suckling on prosthetic dog teats that I'm wearing.
 Actually, we had a different idea.
 Now that Judy's gone, it's kind of obvious someone is the odd person out.
 It's Jerome, right? I didn't want to say anything 'cause I was trying to be a good mother, but you're cheesy, and everyone hates you.
 No, Jenna, you.
 You're so much older than the rest of us, so we're thinking the show is more like The girls next door, and you're that old boat captain that shows up sometimes.
 That's Hugh Hefner, Jessica.
 Yeah, we have no idea who that is, so you're kind of just proving our point.
 I see.
 Very well.
 Looking for this? Well played.
 Dude, what's up? I'm just having a bad day, sir.
 All right, bro-bro, let's just be cool, and sit down and pee in silence, like dudes do.
 It's just I started a new job, and it's stressful enough just having my own wastebasket that I have to fill every day without Liz Lemon yelling at me, and I just wish I had never been born! 'Cause if I can't even get my friend Liz At least I thought she was my friend To respect me, how will I ever run a network and boss around those Jewish executives that were trained from birth to argue? So, I should just give Liz what she wants, and quit.
 Bro You should just smack that Liz in the mouth.
 Sorry I babbled so much.
 Thanks for listening.
 I'm Kenneth, by the way.
 Me too.
 I'm Kenneth.
 Kenneth uh Toilethole.
 I'm so sorry Dr.
 Melvoin.
 You know, I already apologized to Vickie, and to fat Vickie.
 Fat Vickie's parents were very upset that she was dragged into this mess.
 I know.
 I know what I did was stupid, and I've really learned my lesson.
 Look, if I could go back in time, I'd just I'd skip clarinet, and I'd go to the spring football with my friends, and none of this ever would've happened.
 Or you simply could have not posted those pictures.
 On hot Vickie's youface page, miss Hooper.
 Hold on, Melvoin.
 You told me it was the piano, and that everyone went to the King of Prussia mall.
 Well I don't remember.
 And I'm just so emotional right now.
 I'm sorry, how are you related to miss Hooper? I'm her Nemesis.
 You bastard.
 Don't do this, Donaghy.
 I think that this school has done everything it can for Kaylie, but the only fitting punishment Is expulsion.
 It's days like this that remind me why I got into teaching in the first place.
 Kenneth, we need to talk.
 I don't know, 'cause someone who actually cares about my feelings told me to smack you in the mouth.
 No, don't listen to Kenneth Toilethole.
 You know him? Yeah.
 He's great.
 We should all go get dinner sometime.
 Kenneth, you can do this job, and I do respect you.
 Then wash my feet with your hair.
 No! But I did completely rewrite the show.
 We're not even using the word "dingbat," Mr.
 Parcell.
 A Parcell man has never been called "mister" outside of an execution chamber.
 Boy.
 The blonde ones, they turned on me.
 They threw me away like I was some kind of Judy.
 Oh, God.
 Is this how Judy felt? Judy was nice and sweet and wanted to get a coffee enema or something, and I treated her like garbage.
 Well, then why don't you apologize to her? She's right behind you.
 Judy, you're so beautiful now! I just came to say good-bye before I head home.
 I wish we had spent more time together, but I guess I'll see you on TV.
 No.
 Of all my children, you're the only one that proves there's any good in me.
 Forget TV.
 Let's go get that coffee now.
 No.
 You know you can't do that.
 One minute to air.
 One minute.
 I have to stop Jenna from leaving.
 You just No problem.
 I'll cover.
 Day two of my fast, and you were right.
 My mind is clear, and I'm sharp as a tack.
 Great, Tray, thanks.
 My brain is working overtime.
 I finally understand the ending of The sixth sense.
 Those names are the people who worked on the movie.
 Yeah, and I just got what you were trying to tell me yesterday.
 You want me to do my filthy stand-up act instead of reading the cue cards.
 No.
 Jack! Help! I was right about Kaylie, and I crushed her.
 That's great.
 I need The whole time, she was playing me, but in the end, she made the biggest mistake.
 She could not have been worse in that meeting than if she had wanted me to Son of a dingbat! Tracy's gonna do his stand-up act on the show! What are we gonna do? I'm gonna live bleep him.
 Normally, I'd have to get permission from Irene first, but there isn't time.
 You know why I love Dominican women? 'Cause they love to those big 'Cause they eat all our aloud.
 I'd like to introduce housed in a [Bleep], booooy! You just ate a with extra? Well, you called the right.
 That's our show for tonight! See you next week! That was amazing! It sure was.
 Kenneth, I'm Gaylord Felcher.
 The head of Standards? I have never seen bleeping like that, so guess what? I'm promoting you, you littleface.
 All right, Felcher, you don't have to talk like that.
 Well, who's gonna stop me? Who among you has the power to censor the censor? What a surprise.
 Whatever are you doing here, Kaylie Hooper? Enjoying my total lack of adult supervision.
 I just had fruit roll-ups for dinner At a strip club.
 Do you wanted to get expelled from school, didn't you? Look who figured it out.
 It only took you, oh, I don't know, a million hours.
 You didn't lie to me about getting sent to school in the "Middle of nowhere.
" What I realized too late is, you were talking about Beekman Academy, right here in Manhattan, in the neighborhood North of ware street, otherwise known as, uh, "noware.
" Now I'll be able to be close to my boyfriend Henry.
 Like hot Vickie could ever steal him from me.
 He's going to NYU.
 To study acting.
 If Pop-Pop had gone to that meeting, he would have just written a check and made it all go away.
 You needed somebody to throw you under the bus.
 You needed a patsy.
 I, uh, couldn't help but notice that lacrosse ball in your backpack.
 Too bad I'm on the board of the Central Park conservancy, so beekman won't have a field to play on next year.
 Well, good, 'cause I planted that lacrosse ball there to get back at a girl I hate who plays lacrosse.
 Her name is Jack ie.
 Jackie officecouch.
 Damn you, Donaghy! Cato? Seriously, not tonight.
 I mean it this time.
 Son of a dingbat!  Sorry.
 That phone call took forever.
 Where's Kenneth Toilethole? You just missed him.
 Again.
 He had to go to the bathroom.
 You know what? I'll go get him.
 No, don't! Every time one of you leaves, the other one comes back.
 You know, I'm starting to suspect that I have bad luck.
 Dude, bro, where's Liz? You didn't see her? She just left.
 I gotta go feed the meter.
   

                




                    			  Tracy, Jenna.
 We all know what happen when you hosted the St.
 Patrick's day parade three years ago.
 [Celtic music] Wake up, mother-[Bleep].
 And when you hosted two years ago.
 Die, demon! Why didn't you ever call me back? Unfortunately, unless Harry's law really took off this week and no one told me, you two are the biggest stars at the network.
 But this year, everything you say will be scripted and on prompter.
 Do not deviate from the script.
 Jack, Tracy and I are total pros.
 On television, and when it comes to the assisted suicide debate.
 Secret handshake, my baloney.
 Hazel, I won't be here tomorrow, so I wanted to give you this.
 It's the tail I had until I was 16.
 Well, don't worry about the parade.
 I'll take care of Tracy and Jenna like they're my own children.
 Which is a bad example, because I left my kids at a sears in 2004.
 Oh, I told you about Mr.
 Jordan's allergies, right? Yes, Kenneth.
 He's only allergic to allergy medication.
 But he loves it.
 And Ms.
 Mulroney's Kenneth, let go.
 This is my rodeo now.
 Well, not literally, of course.
 The U.
S.
 Rodeo Association does not lift lifetime bans.
 So are you gonna work through St.
 Patrick's day? Don't you want to celebrate Ireland's great accomplishments, like Michael Lohan and vomiting into a bagpipe? Wow, Lemon, so I take it you will not be wearing green tomorrow.
 I will be wearing head-to-toe orange, in honor of protestant William of Orange, inventor of the Orange, according to Yahoo answers.
 You in Orange? You'll look like a creamsicle with an old tooth stuck in it.
 Well, you'll never see me, 'cause I don't leave my house on St.
 Patrick's day.
 Criss and I are going to ride out hurricane shamrock holed up in my apartment, laughing at excerpts from Angela's ashes.
 You know, some people might find your attitude offensive.
 Oh, what are they going to do about it, write a meandering play about how amazing the Irish are at not overcoming adversity? Well, I'm sorry we can't all belong to ethnic groups as beloved as the Germans.
 Please, without Germans, you wouldn't have any of the Indiana Jonesmovies.
 Lemon, your secret love of the Irish is well-documented.
 After all, I am your mentor, you dated Dennis Duffy, and in the '90s, you gave money to the IRA.
 I thought it was contributing to a retirement account.
 You know, I think someone needs to learn a St.
 Patrick's day lesson.
 [Speaking gaelic] What is that? A curse? Take it back, you witch! [Exciting jazz music]  S06 Ep 12 St.
 Patrick's Day On Radio: This American life, Saturday, March 17th, St.
 Patrick's day.
 You know, everybody complains about the weather, but today on the program, we meet somebody who actually [Glass breaking] Hey, what are you doing? Get out of my studio! [People cheering] Happy St.
 Patrick's day! Let go of me! Didn't you hear my show on bullying? Hey, Criss, watch this.
 [Celtic music playing] Megan! Megan! Look at them spin around.
 They're so confused.
 Awesome.
 It's too many Megans, right? I love you.
 Uh huh.
 I just ordered thai food.
 How much do you love me now? [Knock at door] Man, they're fast.
 You know what, I can't wait till the asians take over.
 Thank God for delivery, keeping us inside and safe from all the Irish nonsense.
 Hey, dummy.
 The curse.
 What's up? I'm Dennis, a former lover of Liz's.
 Oh.
 I tried to steal beer from a Duane reade, and some black guy cold-cocked me.
 Ooh, like a security guard? I don't know, pal.
 I don't see people that way.
 [Groans] No, no.
 No.
 Hey, before we go on, do you want to pray together? Yeah.
 Oh, Michael Jackson's ghost Oh, Great Kabbalah monster NBC is showing the promo I worked on for the parade! I'm famous.
 And now back to NBC's live coverage of the 2012 St.
 Patrick's day parade, with hosts Jenna Maroney and Tracy Jordan.
 Oh, my God! They said my name first.
 But I'm more famous than you.
 Oh, this is probably some Hollywood prank, like on the set ocean's 12, when I put that snake in George Clooney's bed.
 I was not in the movie.
 Or maybe now that Kidz is a giant hit, I'm the one America wants to see.
 You better not be talking about my dear friend, America Ferrera.
 Get your stuff out of here, 'cause I get the bigger dressing room now.
 I'll replace your lizard with a gay guy in a giant champagne bottle.
 Siri, kill Jenna! Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on? I get second billing to this small-boobied grandma? No, you guys are friends, remember? "My baloney"? The only baloney Tracy has is the baloney he's full of.
 [Crying] Why would you say that? You can't take that back.
 [Sobbing] Siri: I killed Jenna elfman.
 Is that right? Did you show them the promo? Hazel, we don't let them watch NBC.
 Jenna thinks that Christina Aguilera lost her voice during childbirth, and Tracy doesn't need to know that he just became number two around here.
 That kind of mistake can ruin everything.
 I don't like the way you're talking to me.
 Why don't we drive to Sears? I'll buy you a toy.
 Excuse me.
 May I help you? What? We don't use your bathroom when you're not here.
 I'm Lutz.
 Frank, first of all, what are you doing here on a Saturday? None of the writers can go out on St.
 Patrick's day because we all have faces people naturally just want to punch.
 So we're all hiding out here, playing Colonizers of Malaar.
 It's a strategy board game from the makers Goblet quest and virginity keep.
 In Malaar, you build a kingdom and battle for world domination.
 Right now, I'm just the Lord of the Karthian plains, but that means I control all the wheat! Huh.
 It's actually interesting.
 You have a monopoly on wheat.
 But what happens if you overproduce, flood the markets? Prices drop, your economy collapses.
 You've got to diversify, Frank.
 It's basic capitalism.
 What other resources do you have? Uh, unicorns? Can you breed and sell them? There's got to be a market for unicorns.
 If I've learned anything from reading Liddy's princess books, unicorn hair has magical properties.
 You've got to know your product, Frank.
 That's awesome.
 Ah, it's nothing.
 That kind of thinking is what I do for a living.
 At least, I used to.
 You just have to replace "Malaar" with "Fairfield, Connecticut," and "unicorn" with "Project: Unicorn," a death Ray.
 Hot dog truck, huh? I went entrepreneur, too.
 I got this new business where I burn your old DVDs onto laserdisc.
 Whoa, Dennis, I don't think you should be drinking with a head injury.
 [Laughing] That's a good Liz impression, Criss.
 She's a bummer.
 Well, 911 is still busy.
 What could be causing so many medical emergencies today? Oh, right, an Irish religious festival.
 Irish pride! Go, Celtics! Celtics suck.
 Go, Knicks! As soon as I get through, I'm getting you an ambulance, and you are out of here, Dennis.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 I can't get into an ambulance.
 I don't have health insurance because of Obama.
 Look, Liz, I don't think he needs to go to the hospital for a concussion.
 I was a volunteer EMT.
 At burning man, and we agreed never to talk about that.
 At sunset, the CACTI start to resemble people looking for hugs.
 It gets ugly, Liz.
 You know, there's some things I miss about being with you, like having somewhere to hook my SEGA up to, but this constant judgment Criss deserves better.
 Criss, may I speak to you alone for a minute? No.
 Anything you need to say to him, you can say in front of me.
 Me and Criss We're bang brothers.
 Ugh.
  God, live TV's such a rush.
 It's like sex, but your husband isn't looking at a picture of a bridge.
 Peter, can you explain this to me? Well, obviously I'm host number one.
 We all saw the promo.
 Hazel, the script had Tracy and Jenna's names in it.
 Did you change that? Duh! After you PMS-ed about their names yesterday, I thought numbers would make everyone happy.
 We're on in five, four, three Both: Welcome to the 2012 St.
 Patrick's day parade on NBC.
 They're both reading host number one.
 Would a third host help? I am S.
A.
G.
 eligible, but I will only do nude stuff if there's a mirror behind me.
 Forget the parade, Hazel! For six years, we've been tricking them into thinking they're friends, and you've undone all that in a day.
 Both: I understand you have some interesting trivia about this year's parade.
 No way, that's amazing! No.
 I've moved on.
 Both: I couldn't agree more.
 I'm playing two timber and one brick to build a bridge and establish a trading post in Midgar.
 [Dice clatter] That failed And the Orcs raped everybody.
 Okay, and I am offering Frank for the neutral land between the Elf kingdoms.
 I'll double it.
 The price is now 3000.
 I'll mortgage Theowyn castle.
 I'll take out a loan.
 Don't you see what you're doing? You're creating a real estate bubble, and the only person who'll benefit is sue, who'll buy up all the neutral land for cents on the dollar.
 Thanks a lot, Klootzak.
 I don't come to where you work and slap the It's basic macroeconomics, people.
 None of you is fit to be king of Malaar.
 And you would presume to wield the scepter of Thalbain? Yes.
 Yes, I would.
 Why are you being nice to him? What, you want me to be jealous? I'm not that guy.
 I'm this guy.
 No, you need to know something.
 Dennis Duffy is like the Terminator with cheaper sunglasses.
 He just keeps coming back, because his potato brain thinks he still has a chance with me.
 Hey, Liz, you'll be back.
 If I ever see you again, I'll kill you.
 You'll be back.
 Never again! You'll be back, Liz Lemon.
 You'll be back.
 I'm not kicking Dennis out of here in his condition.
 Guy with a concussion on St.
 Patrick's day is like a horse with a broken leg.
 Exactly.
 We should shoot him.
 Don't you see what he's doing? He's already driving a wedge between us.
 Criss, get in here.
 There's a lez movie on showtime.
 Um [Dramatic music]  [Indistinct chanting] [Dice rattling] Ugh, three again? And your yak Has smallpox.
 Rockefeller, no! [Cell phone ringing] What? Dennis is here.
 Take back your curse.
 This isn't funny anymore.
 Oh, really? You're cursed? Try ruling over the desert wastelands of Kroth with no spell cards.
 Are you playing Volonizers of Lamar with the writers? Malaar, and this game is just dumb luck.
 I dug all these trenches to irrigate the desert But no one's playing his rain ca [Yelps] I'm trapped in a barren wasteland, and no matter what I do, I can't get out.
 Wait.
 [Hangs up phone] Oh, my God, it's happening again.
 The desert of Kroth is Kabletown.
 I've got to get some fresh air.
 So fine, two can play at this game.
 I'm putting an old German curse on you.
 [Speaking German] [Door opens] Hey, Dennis had a great idea.
 No.
 I should take the hot dog truck out after the parade, and sell empty buns to drunk people.
 Oh, my God, Criss, he's just trying to get me alone so he can start a gas leak or claim squatter's rights or hit me over the head, and when I wake up, we're on our honeymoon.
 At seaworld.
 Are you sure this is Dennis's obsession? 'Cause you're the one who can't seem to stop talking about him.
 Are you kidding? I know Dennis Duffy's brain.
 I saw some of it when he jumped on the ice during an islanders game.
 His next move will be mentioning some fake girlfriend to try to make me jealous But I'm going to turn it against him.
 And once again, the puppet will become the puppet master.
 What does that mean, "once again"? That's not a thing.
 This ends right now.
 Dude, you missed the end of the lez movie.
 Their daughter, she goes off to college, and Mark Ruffalo, he's just gonna do his own thing with the restaurant.
 Look, is there anyone you want us to call to let them know you're okay? I left a message for Megan earlier, but it's hard for her to answer her phone, 'cause her boobs are so big.
 I'm sorry, and who's Megan? She's my lady, Liz.
 I'm seeing someone.
 She's a card girl at kangaroo boxing matches, so she's got a body, and she's loaded.
 Her grandfather invented the stop sign.
 Wait, are you saying you're over me? Elizabeth, don't do this.
 [Fake crying] Because I am not over you.
 I never will be! I love you, Dennis.
 I love you so much Whoa, what the hell, Liz? No, Criss, I'm just proving my point.
 I don't care what you're doing.
 So it turns out you can't say "I love you," just not to me.
 Wait, what? It's not like you haven't had the chance to say it.
 Love you.
 You're the best.
 Love you.
 Scooby-doo.
 I love you.
 I just ordered thai food.
 And I thought you were just emotionally infantile.
 I am! Me baby.
 Yeah.
 I'm gonna take the truck out.
 Oh, no, it's happening.
 The wedge! [Groaning] Liz, we need to talk.
 Open the bag of wine.
 And we're back with our live coverage of the St.
 Patrick's day parade.
 I'm Al Roker, taking over for Jenna Maroney and Tracy Jordan.
 He should have said my name first.
 Roker should be on my side.
 Why, because you both have had huge weight fluctuations? [Sobbing loudly] [Phone ringing] [Shouting] What? Okay, that's not how you're supposed to answer the phone.
 Just thought I'd check in.
 Everything's fine.
 Pete says I'm doing great.
 I'm not about to screw this up, Kenneth, 'cause I'd get kicked out of show business, and then how would I be famous? By starting a fire and then rescuing everyone from it? And then I'm a hero and then I'm Playboy? Hazel, are Mr.
 Jordan and Ms.
 Maroney fighting? Well, you're not a page anymore, Kenneth.
 That information is classified.
 [Solemn music playing]  You look troubled, son.
 Would you like to talk about it? I'm stuck, father.
 Stuck in a company that won't innovate or change.
 I feel helpless.
 Impotent.
 Whoa, buy me a drink first.
 [Laughs] Sorry, we've been instructed to keep it light.
 Ah.
 Now there's a man who overcame some difficulties.
 I'm sure you know the story of St.
 Patrick, driving the snakes out of Ireland.
 I'm going to have to stop you right there, father, 'cause I know for a fact that there were never any snakes in Ireland, and St.
 Patrick didn't drive anything out of anywhere.
 Knock, knock.
 First of all, he was born in fourth century Ireland.
 He might as well have been born in a grave.
 His only worldly possession was no snakes.
 But he turned that Huh into sainthood, a holiday, this magnificent cathedral.
 He was just some guy starving in the wilderness Exactly like me.
 But he found a way to change his luck, to take nothing and turn it into [Awed whisper] By the scepter of Thalbain.
 Out! Now! [Sighs] Look, Liz, there's something I've got to tell you.
 Not interested.
 Megan isn't my girlfriend.
 I know, and I am not letting you She's my wife.
 We just got back from Seaworld yesterday, and I know this is hard for you to hear Oh, yeah, it's so hard for me to hear about your "wife.
" I'm so jealous.
 Dennis, baby! I would have got here sooner, but I passed out laughing on 69th Street.
 That's hilarious, Megs.
 What's up, sugar? Hi, how are you? How are you doing? Wait a minute, Megan is real? I thought you were lying to get us back together.
 That's why I said I loved you.
 I was trying to call your bluff.
 Wow, you know, that's really messed up, Liz.
 Okay, wait, you said you love him? [Laughs] Okay.
 You got two minutes to fill a sock with quarters, and then we go outside.
 Oh, my God, stop it, no more of this Irish nonsense.
 Dennis, you came in here, possibly as part of a curse, and ruined everything! What? I did nothing.
 Hey, if anyone's full of Irish nonsense, it's you.
 Excuse me? Think about it.
 You're the one that got all emotional and made a fool of herself at a party.
 This wasn't a party.
 Tell me about it.
 It sucked.
 Look, you're stubborn, you hold grudges, you're emotionally repressed.
 She's been living with this great guy, and hasn't said "I love you" yet.
 Really? Not even on a Ferris wheel? Ugh.
 Let's face it, Liz.
 You're the most Irish person here.
 Happy St.
 Patrick's day, dummy.
 Wait, it's St.
 Patrick's day? St.
 Patrick's day, baby.
 [Shrieks happily] [Sighs] The first car is here for whichever one of you wants to leave first.
 [Groans] Why do I keep doing this stuff? Is 70 not a good IQ? Well, the bigger star gets the first car.
 But the sign says it's for host number two.
 I'm scared, J-mohr.
 And not just 'cause today's the day that guy that tried to kill me gets out of jail.
 I'm scared 'cause What if I'm not the biggest star anymore? Tracy, I know how you feel.
 I've felt that way for the past five years.
 And now that I've gotten everything I wanted, all I can think about is how quickly it can all go away.
 Tell me about it.
 A year ago, I won an Oscar.
 Now look at me.
 I had to beg to take over for Andy Rooney.
 And it did not go well.
 When I was a kid, you could get a prostitute for $5.
 You know what? I'll read host number two.
 No.
 We'll read it together.
 Aww.
 Know this, Hazel.
 I will always be here For them and for you.
 Nothing can ever make me [Over megaphone] Move your car.
 [Siren wailing] [Indistinct chatter] I'd like to spend my remaining gold To purchase a fire spell.
 And against whom will you be casting this spell? Against myself.
 I am setting fire to my own desert.
 You're insane! Am I? I'm going to turn my desert into glass, and glass is a commodity that you all need, for your elfin oracle mirrors, for your crystal palace, for the colorful glass beads that you keep buying for some reason.
 I'm going to wear them to the pirates' ball.
 You need my glass.
 And I'll take your gold And eventually, the throne of 1,000 kings.
 You see, it doesn't matter if I'm on the wind-blown dunes of Kroth or in the fluorescent-lit boardrooms of 30 Rockefeller Plaza.
 [Echoing] I will create something from nothing.
 Today Malaar Tomorrow Kabletown.
 [Coins jangling] Your highness, you may take your right as king.
 I am a virgin with white guys.
 All right, mustard only.
 There you go.
 Enjoy your bun.
 Sorry, sorry.
 These are the only green things I own.
 More importantly, I have never been with someone for longer than nine months.
 You and I have been together for six, so I assume something will go wrong soon.
 You'll tell me you believe in ghosts, or I'll reveal that I am terrible at expressing my feelings.
 But it's not because I don't have them.
 It's just because I'm used to being let down.
 Wait, is now the time on St.
 Patrick's day when we talk about our feelings? I don't understand your art, Kevin.
 [Spluttering] But this isn't fair to you, Criss.
 This is the happiest I've been in a long time, and I'm sorry that I can't just be a normal person and tell you stuff.
 Like, nice stuff.
 Like Greeting card stuff.
 Oh, you're right there, buddy.
 Come on, homestretch.
 Come on.
 [Groaning] Okay.
 I love you.
 I know.
 [Gasps] You solo-ed me.
 [Crowd shouting] Both: Thanks, host number one.
 Let's take a look at what's happening live in Rockefeller Plaza.
 I love you.
 Oh, I got this! That is a person named Liz Lemon who just told some dude she loves him.
 Well, I have known her for a long time and she never said that before.
 **** Also, TV viewers liked when in a show is a song.
 Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling From glen to glen, and down the mountain side Don't you dare fade out on me.
   

                




                    			  On the subject "why I lotgs?" Please tell me it's not-- The annual tgs viewer walk-on contest.
 It's great promotion, lemon.
 We found that if someone is actually on nbc, They're 4% more likely to watch it.
 Really? We're doing this again? After what happened last year? Gassy patsy, you can't eat-- [robotic voice] keep the white house white.
 [audience boos] You know who enters these walk-on contests? Weirdos.
 Read the essays, lemon.
 It's not going to kill you.
 Oh, really? 'cause this one is typed on the inside Of a bloody halter top.
 Just pick one.
 And while you're at it, which one of these ties Do you prefer? I thought you said a man should never wear pastel Unless he's a black guy on easter.
 Usually, but I'm going on   the today show To talk about avery, And I need to tone down my natural aura Of strength and sexual dominance.
 Which wasn't going to happen With the tie I was going to wear.
 [gasps] oh, my.
 [stammers] So, uh, what is the news with avery? Uh, there isn't any, and that's the problem.
 The u.
N.
 Is useless, the state department Is full of democrats, And as it turns out, amnesty international Is nothing but a company that makes and sells candles.
 That explains all the vigils.
 That is a good scam.
 It's been a year, and the media have moved on.
 Media is a plural noun.
 Put this tie on.
 I have to find a way to get avery's story Back on the front page.
 Fortunately, I run a network with a news division, And I will do whatever it takes to keep avery's plight In the public eye.
 Even Go and see matt lauer's band.
 It's blues rock, lemon.
 It's called Rhythm and news.
 Lemon, no.
 [exciting jazz music]  Sir, I've been thinking.
 I know I'm a big shot now with my suits And a desk lamp that I control, But I just want you to know I will always be a page at heart.
 Even if I did just receive a fancy award at my new job.
 On behalf of the mother[bleep] Standards department, I, gaylord felcher, present you With the "employee of the [bleep] week" award.
 Let's give it up for this [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] [bleep] bag of [bleep].
 So what can I get for you? And hazel's on it, tracy.
 Kenneth, can I speak with you? Can you? You just did.
 What's your problem? Oh, my, well My parents were technically brothers-- Look, I'm trying to do my job here.
 Tracy's my responsibility now.
 I take care of him.
 Oh, well, I'm sorry, ms.
 What's-her-name, But I'll always be there for mr.
 Jordan.
 He has a special place in my heart.
 Just like nana parcell, my heartworm.
 Ugh! Hey, jack.
 What are you still doing here? Your segment was bumped.
 What? Why? You guys doing another hard-hitting expose On how to plan a staycation with your cyber bully? No, it's real news for once.
 There was a mine collapse in china.
 Turns out, to keep labor costs down, All the miners there are babies.
 They pay 'em in yogurt.
 God.
 Remember when we used to be the world leader in baby cuteness? I can't compete with that.
 Also, adult dogs can't fit in the baby mines, So they're lowering down puppies to bring in supplies.
 [sighs] Hey, thanks for coming to see my band last night.
 Yes, I didn't expect you to play for four hours.
 Hey, dummies, I need you guys to write a sketch With a non-speaking part for whoever wins this dumb contest.
 And do not write another sketch about krang From teenage mutant ninja turtles.
 No one knows who krang is.
 It would be a waste of time to talk about krang on television.
 No more krang! Liz? Krang! What the hell, hazel? Can I ask your advice, woman to woman? Are you sure? 'cause I took one of those "which gossip girl are you?" quizzes, And it said I was the dad's guitar.
 [scoffs] please.
 You are so amazing.
 This place is such a boys' club, But you boss them around like an amazon warrior queen.
 And look at your body.
 Your rack is like, "pow!" Hazel, what is the question? It's kenneth.
 He's not a page anymore, But he keeps trying to do my job for me.
 And when I confronted him about it, He was so condescending.
 He laughed at me, and then he undressed me with his eyes.
 And then he had his way with me.
 With his eyes.
 Ugh.
 The male gaze.
 Yeah.
 They're all a bunch of gays.
 No, kenneth is sweet, but he's still a man.
 And in our society, men get praised For just taking whatever they want.
 But what do people call women who are tough and ambitious? Leslie or courtney? What? No.
 A bitch.
 Well, you may be at the bottom of the totem pole now, But you're in the game.
 So play it like a man and don't let anyone try to stop you.
 Just like the karate kid-- hilary swankarate kid iv.
 I want you to be my mentor.
 Julie-san, fighting not good.
 But if must fight, win.
 Kesuke miyagi, karate kid iv.
 I accept! You listen to me, blitzer.
 Either cnn gets back on the avery jessup story, Or I'll tell everyone your real name, steel hammerhands.
 [click] hello? Steel? Mr.
 Hammerhands? Jack.
 I have an important actor request.
 This is not really a good time, jenna.
 I want you to hire a giant to stand in the background Of every scene I'm in to make me look daintier.
 It works.
 It's why lamar odom married that giant kardashian girl.
 I run a tv network, And I still can't get my wife's story on the air.
 The world may have forgotten about avery, but I haven't.
 Sometimes at night, I sit here in the dark, Drinking scotch, staring at that doorway, Hoping against hope That she'll walk as if nothing ever happened.
 "I'm home, jack.
 And I brought back a bunch of oriental sex powders.
" I know how you can get avery back on television.
 Her story has everything! Blondeness, kidnapping, A villain with an accent.
 It's the perfect tv movie.
 I should know.
 I played italian party whore in   the amanda knox story.
 A tv movie--jenna, I don't want to trivialize this ordeal.
 But those movies get results.
 Every kidnapped woman I've ever played Has been released.
 Well, it would allow me to control the story.
 Well, you better hurry, jack.
 Oxygen is already working on a movie About the baby miners.
 Then we'll have to slow them down.
 Gabriel Send a bunch of pies to the oxygen network.
 Excuse me, ms.
 What's-her-name.
 What's that? Not that it's any of your business, But tracy's jaw is tired from pretending to be pac-man.
 So I'm making it easier for him to eat.
 No! No! He can't eat that junk.
 He just got his cholesterol down to triple digits.
 Get off my ass, parcell.
 I'm doing my job.
 You think you can push me around just because you have a penis? I definitely have a penis.
 You think I'm some delicate little girl Who'll do whatever you say? Well, I'm not delicate.
 I've been in tons of car wrecks.
 Hazel, I just peed this.
 Could you take care of it for me? Sir! I am resuming responsibility for your care.
 You are in dire need Of a getting-your-act-together montage.
  down so low, don't know what up is   when-- I'm sorry, tracy.
 You wanna be bossed around by this trailer park hitler? Or do you wanna do whatever you want with a sexy, fun bitch Who just bought you a pinata? Awesome! [inaudible] + Miss lemon, do you have a second Or are you busy regretting your life choices, For example, missing your window for having children? Get to the point, kenneth.
 It's hazel.
 I'm trying to help her, but she's gone crazy.
 Uh-huh.
 You can't handle the fact That a woman is doing your old job.
 What a world.
 I bet even hillary clinton has to put up with this crap From whoever was secretary of state before her.
 You mean condoleezza-- shut up.
 Look, I believe in hazel.
 I happen to be her mentor.
 So to quote mr.
 Miyagi, "leave girl alone or you deal with me, surf shop owner.
" Hey, sweetie.
 How was your day? Not even half over, hazel.
 Ugh! I still have to read all these essays.
 Okay.
 Look at you.
 You're a whirlwind-- in charge in the board room And the bedroom.
 Sure.
 You're a modern, dtf type woman Whose whole vibe says, "yeah! Dig sex and I'm not gonna apologize for it.
" Okay, here's a little bedroom tip.
 Put a bag of popcorn in the microwave beforehand.
 That way, when you're done, you have a treat.
 I wish I had your emotional intelligence.
 My boyfriend razmig and I have hit a little rough patch.
 Okay.
 Lay it on me.
 Well, I went home this afternoon to get some, And I found razmig banging the fattest chick I've ever seen.
 And you know, I used to weigh 800 pounds.
 Stop right there.
 You didn't hit a rough patch.
 He cheated on you.
 You have to dump him immediately.
 What? How can you say that? Hazel, I'm trying to help you.
 By asking me to break up with the man I love? Helping me would be teaching me how to spice things up.
 Like by greeting him at the front door Wearing nothing but false teeth.
 I'm very disappointed in your mentorship, liz.
 If this were two years ago, I would sit on you till you died.
 No wigs.
 I said no wigs.
 You're not a lead, gabe.
 At best, you're a featured extra with no lines.
 Do you understand? Hey, gabe.
 Lemon, would you be interested in writing the screenplay For the greatest love story ever told? You mean lois lane's love affair with journalism? I said it.
 Avery and me.
 I'm producing a television movie To get her back in the headlines.
 For obvious reasons, I'm fast-tracking the project.
 The script is due on Monday.
 Monday? Hmm.
 I guess I won't be able to go to the gym this weekend.
 I know it's short notice, But I would consider it a personal favor After six years of listening to you complain About how there are so few women on death row.
 Is a coincidence, or is the system sexist? Oh! Speaking of our amazing dynamic, I have taken on a mentee of my own, jack-- A page named hazel.
 You're a mentor? But that makes me a grand-mentor.
 And I'm still so young.
 Don't worry.
 I already messed it up.
 I told her to break up with her awful boyfriend And she got really mad at me.
 Often, the best way for a mentee to learn Is for you to let her fail.
 Wait, does that mean you've done that to me? When? Um-- I think the crowd at the apollo Might welcome a change of pace.
 You're right.
 You should do it.
 Sometimes, they have to learn the hard way.
 If hazel rejects your advice, let her.
 She'll get there on her own Just like you did after the crowd at the apollo Chased you into the river.
 Okay, I understand the irony of what I'm about to say, But I reject that advice.
 Don't worry, I'll bring you back a t-shirt from successtown.
 Ow! My groin! Mr.
 Jordan! K-dog.
 You were wrong.
 They do still make crossbows.
 You let him buy a crossbow? And a motorcycle? No, kenneth, I let him buy a motorcycle ramp And no motorcycle! Can I help you? Tracy's very tired.
 He didn't sleep last night.
 Why not? If he doesn't get at least He starts to go crazy.
 We on a show within a show! My real name is tracy morgan! Well, tracy wanted to go clubbing.
 And I don't know if you know this, kenneth, But night clubs are open at night.
 You didn't let him drink, did you? Mr.
 Jordan can't mix alcohol with his medication.
 I'm not an idiot, kenneth.
 I took him off his medication.
 You what? Why are you doing this? Because liz told me to.
 Having access to tracy is an opportunity, And I'm taking advantage of it.
 Did you see page six today? Those are my toes he's sucking on.
 And he did not want to.
 [gasping] ah, mm.
 Jack! What the hell is this? Where did you get that? Donna from casting and I are friends.
 Well, not so much friends As I own a magnet that can scramble her pacemaker.
 Jenna, you are not playing avery.
 Why not? This movie was my idea! I appreciate that.
 You can play a korean party whore.
 I just don't think you can capture avery's essence.
 That's ridiculous.
 I posed bottomless in essence.
 Jenna, avery is worldly.
 Traveled.
 She went to yale.
 Oh, I see.
 You think I'm stupid, just because my college Got tipped over by those miami heat fans.
 I didn't say stupid.
 Jenna, there are many kinds of intelligence.
 Practical, emotional, and there's actual intelligence, Which is what I'm talking about.
 I want this part, jack.
 It's a guaranteed emmy nomination.
 I'm sorry.
 I've made up my mind.
 Very well.
 But let me ask you this, jack.
 Would a dumb person be able to think of something amazing To say as she leaves? Liz, we have a show in four hours.
 Have you still not picked a contest winner? Ugh! Fine, I'll just pick one at random.
 It's joren van der sloot.
 We can't fly someone from peru now.
 There's no time.
 Oh, hazel, we need to talk.
 I'm busy, liz.
 Tracy wants me to paom in .
 Is this dress appropriate For watching pornography with penn jillette? Okay, normally we don't encourage tracy to go to vegas, Because of his gambling addiction and his fear of magic.
 But maybe a weekend away from razmig is a good thing.
 No.
 Razmig's coming with me.
 [armenian accent] what? Who is this, hah-zel? I no permit you talk other woman.
 Okay, I'm putting my foot down.
 This guy is no good for you and I order you, as your mentor, To dump him.
 You don't know what you're talking about, liz.
 Razmig is amazing.
 He makes me laugh.
 Oh, where is toilet pail? Razmig must make mud.
 [chuckling] razmig! Hazel, no.
 I'm not letting you-- [jack's voice echoing] let her fail, liz.
 Let her get there on her own.
 You know what, fine.
 You're right, I'm wrong.
 Go, be with razmig.
 Thank you, liz.
 It takes a big woman to admit she's wrong.
 You are a big woman.
 You have pictures? Fat nudes? [knocking] I need your help, ms.
 Maroney.
 Absolutely.
 Oh, I thought you were someone famous.
 You sound a lot like reese witherspoon.
 What do you want? I'm afraid if mr.
 Jordan goes to las vegas this weekend, He's gonna die.
 I'm not hearing my name, kenneth.
 So I thought you-- Oh, thank god.
 That took forever.
 I thought you could teach me how to get around hazel.
 If I could just get one minute alone with mr.
 Jordan-- You can convince him he's wrong.
 Yes! But how do you get his attention? All the world's a stage, kenneth.
 Just play the part.
 Play the part? + Ms.
 Lemon.
 If it's not too late, I would like the essay contest to win a role On   tgs with tracy jordan.
 No, kenneth, you can't enter.
 The contest isn't open to nbc employees.
 I know, ma'am-maw.
 Which is why I just quit my job At standards and practices.
 I may [bleep] hate you right now, You little [bleep], but [bleep] damn it I respect you.
 Kenneth, you know this is just To be a non-speaking extra, right? I know.
 But have you ever loved something so much That you would sacrifice anything for it? Nope.
 But you know what, this is perfect.
 Because then I don't have to pick some crazy person, And I know you won't do anything weird on the air.
 I'm kenneth! Get to wardrobe, contest winner! This is gonna be a great show.
 Hello? Hi, it's charles from the u.
N.
 We found your wife And I dropped her off at the office.
 She should be there right about now.
 Jack, it's me.
 I'm home.
 No, you're not my wife.
 How could you say that, darling? I'm avery jesbert.
 Jenna? No, don't turn on the light.
 Surprised? Let's set aside how idiotic that plan was, And imagine a world where it actually worked.
 I appreciate your feedback.
 If I had believed you for one second, I would've been devastated, heartbroken! You wanna talk about devastation? How do you think I felt when you told me I couldn't play avery? You are a monster.
 What you have done here today, it's--it's The second cruelest thing that anyone has ever done to me.
 Do you know what the cruelest is? When I went to the bathroom on the hood of your car Before I thought of this plan? Avery had me committed to a mental hospital So she and her college roommate Could use my yankee tickets on opening day.
 That's a nice story, jack, but I don't hear my name in it.
 You-- finally.
 You may not have avery's grace and acumen, But you do have the one thing that makes her so special-- Her ruthless pursuit of self-interest.
 It's the heart of capitalism.
 And the beautiful black heart of my wife.
 Jenna, you have avery's essence.
 Congratulations.
 The part is yours.
 Oh! You won't regret this.
 We're gonna get her home, jack.
 Now if you'll excuse me, I have a female condom to take out.
 Unless Going once Four, three-- [audience cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, A message from the president of the United States.
 Goo-goo, ga-ga, my fellow ah-meh-ri-cans.
 Okay, he's never been worse.
 Is kenneth supposed to enter? I love you, sir.
 Ken, where have you been? Damn it.
 I've been here all along.
 I never left.
 And I never will.
 Go to commercial.
 They told us we can't do that any more.
 What? I quit my job to be here, mr.
 Jordan.
 It was the only way I could get around hazel.
 You quit your job for me? I'm not just gonna sit by and watch you destroy yourself.
 'cause I would do anything for love, But I won't do that.
 The girl in that video was hot in an early '90s kind of way.
 NowTake your medicine.
 This has been a message From the president of the United States.
 Tough night? Come on, lemon.
 The show was all right.
 What about the sketch with the guy who was worried About his sexual performance? That was a real commercial for an erectile dysfunction drug.
 Well, I laughed.
 So, uh, how did things shake out with hazel? Not great.
 My way, which is still the right way, didn't work.
 So just to see, I did your thing.
 Good.
 You let her fail.
 That's how the banking industry learned its lesson.
 And now they're doing amazing, and everyone's honest.
 Mm.
 Your thing didn't work either.
 Are you sure? Mentoring is not an exact science.
 Why aren't there more female serial killers? What does that say about our society-- Liz! Oh, here she is.
 She's here.
 Liz, I was watching the show fall apart While razmig gave me a prison tattoo of his face, And I heard your voice.
 I finally heard everything you said to me.
 "hazel, you're a beautiful flower.
 "let yourself bloom.
 "what are you doing this weekend, hazel? Are there still bath houses? Let's go to one!" I never said any of that, but-- You were right all along.
 You knew I was making the wrong choices.
 But you let me fail.
 With razmig, with tracy.
 Yes, I was definitely on top of that tracy thing.
 You were teaching me the whole time, And all the while lighting a fire with that hot ass.
 I'mJack.
 I'm your grand-mentor.
 Liz? She's beautiful.
 + Okay! Please welcome to the stage leminem! Ooh! [scattered applause, booing]  ahhh, do the sprinkler here we go.
      

                




                    			 Lemon What do you think? "kidnapped bydanger, colon, "the avery jessup story, comma, "brought to you with limited commercial interruptions "by pride bladder control pads.
 Pride: Make every room a bathroom.
" Really, is that the title? 'cause as the writer, I was thinking Of naming it dancing with ophelia-- Don't overthink this.
 It's a classic love story.
 Boy meets girl.
 Girl gets kidnapped by asian dictator.
 Boy makes movie to get girl back.
 Girl's so grateful she does birthday things to boy.
 Boy falls asleep.
 You're forgetting boy meets girl's mother.
 They are creepily attracted to each other.
 What does that have to do with avery and me? Just stick to the story, lemon.
 Tell it exactly how it happened.
 If you get this right, gay men will be dressing up Like avery for Halloween the next 20 years.
 Okay.
 Oh, speaking of Halloween, are you dressing up this year? Lemon, it's March.
 'cause I'm gonna be mitt rom-mummy.
 I call it.
 You can't steal it.
 Why wouldn't you be mitt-zombie? Because I'm an idiot! Oh, come on, liz.
 Think for, like, one second before you buy all that gauze.
 [exciting jazz music]  I didn't want to write a song for the film.
 I wanted to focus on making the film-- What film? The avery tv movie? But my manager, gary greasy, Harangued me to write a song for the film Oh, no, in her mind, she's already accepting an award For whatever this is.
 I need to thank my co-writers, gary greasy And jesus, a homeless man I stole the melody from.
 We also filmed a video for the song for the film.
 Thank you.
  kidnapped, my heart has been stolen   I am kidnapped and I wonder for how long   my darling gone so far  but not forever more  I am kidnapped [chuckles] that's awesome.
 I didn't even realize your song was the original.
 What are you talking about? Weird al.
  knapsack, the zipper is broken   on my knapsack and I lost my bakugan   trapper keeper, snickers bar, my thermos hit the floor   broken knapsack What is that? Weird al yankovic parodied your song.
 Like, michael jackson's eat it or adelesomeone likes food.
 [sighs] it's a huge honor.
 Like, when people wanna see your boobs at mardi gras.
 It's nothing like that.
 I'm calling my lawyer.
 Weird al corrupted something beautiful That was written to distract gary greasy While he came down from meth.
 Hey, kenneth, nice tux.
 My father wore this to his high school prom.
 The theme was enchantment under the jim crow laws.
 So, what's up? Well, as you know, I recently had a minor setback In my goal to become president of television, But I'm ready to start over again at the bottom.
 Well, we're not really hiring now.
 I'll do anything.
 Except work in the sound department.
 Those guys are-- [dubbed over] beautiful geniuses-Holes.
 Look, I'm sorry, kenneth.
 It's just the budget's really tight.
 Okay.
 But if anything comes up, Put a message in a bottle and throw it in the river.
 That's where I go every day to fish for shoes.
 Say, old janitor, Do you know if they're hiring in maintenance? Oh, we're always looking for the next generation of janitors.
 Throw your resume away on the fourth floor And we'll be in touch.
 [all chatter] okay, everyone.
 Welcome to the table read for Kidnapped by danger: The avery jessup story.
 Brought to you with limited commercial interruptions By pride pad.
 Pride: The world is your toilet.
 [all cheer] Written by elizabeth "diablo" lemon.
 We open on a midtown restaurant.
 Jack donaghy, 50s, big irish head, Sips drinks with avery, 30s.
 Avery, do you believe in love at first sight? I believe in two things.
 Fast money and fast curves.
 We smash cut to a night of passion In a completely dark room.
 Bathing suit areas get a workout.
 Interior, hotel room, one month later.
 Jack sits on the bed in a tuxedo.
 His cell phone rings.
 Jack, where are you? We reveal jack's high school sweetheart, nancy donovan, In bed next to him.
 [ridiculous boston accent] jack, who's calling ya At such a wicked late hour? Ya mother? Jack looks around the wedding reception.
 Across the way, his friend liz-- think courteney cox-- Dances with a handsome pilot-- Think a young fred grandy.
 Jack turns to nancy.
 I love you, nancy.
 I want to marry you.
 Stop it, jack.
 Avery's here and she's knocked up.
 Jack looks shocked.
 You gotta do the right thing.
 I'll miss you, jack.
 Go red sox.
 My character seems so passive.
 I mean, what if I were like, "I need to sleep with you both, one more time to decide.
" I don't know, I'm not a writer, but Do that.
 Yeah-- Liz, am I going too big on the accent? No, that's how people from boston sound to me.
 Great.
 Lemon.
 My office now.
 Hey.
 You have amazing skin.
 I'm married to a woman.
 I got four inches of steel that might change your mind.
 Sid, how long will it take to get a cease and desist order Against weird al yankovic? Oh, that's too bad.
 Did they also take away your handgun license? Don't do it, j-mo.
 You don't want to mess with weird al.
 Oh, please.
 I'm not afraid of anyone in show business.
 I turned down intercourse with harvey weinstein On no less than three occasionsOut of five.
 I'm telling you, just let him do it.
 Eminem backed down.
 Lady gaga backed down.
 Tracy, I'm supposed to perform my song on fallon tonight.
 I can't do that now.
 It's ruined.
 I'll have to write a new song.
 Don't you understand? He's gonna parody you again.
 That's what he does.
 That's all he does.
 You can't stop him.
 Unless, I write a song that can't be parodied.
 Impossible.
 What do you think phil collins Was trying to do with sussudio? Which weird al famously parodied soup soupy-o.
 I'm not saying it'll be easy, but if anyone in the world Is talented enough to pull it off I'll make coffee.
 You also make coffee.
 After the coffee contest, we'll start working.
 Yeah.
 Really, lemon? You had to include nancy donovan in your screenplay? You told me to write it exactly how it happened.
 That's not how it happened.
 You took the facts and you twisted them Like chubby checker took the traditional standing dance And made a mockery of it with "the twist".
 This is a love story, lemon.
 You clearly have no idea how to write romance.
 Hey, you wouldn't say that if you read My    mythbusters fan fiction.
 It is sexy.
 And you're welcome for not twisting any more facts.
 Like the fact that nancy got divorced for you With no idea that you'd already gotten another woman pregnant.
 And when avery abandoned you for her career, You told her to go.
 Jack, we need to talk.
 Now there's this hot slut.
 [clears throat] hi, I'm liz.
 I work for jack.
 Diana jessup.
 And I'm glad to see the endgame of feminism Is women dressing like dennis the menace    at work.
 Diana, I wasn't expecting you.
 It has come to my attention that a television movie Is being made about my daughter.
 I knew you would not approve.
 Because it's crass, jack.
 Like personalized wedding vows or standing up in a pool.
 And to hear about it the way I did.
 My housekeeper started screaming.
 I should have called, but I thought it would be awkward.
 I--I mean I thought you would disapprove.
 Not that there's anything awkward between us.
 Of course there's no other reason it would be awkward.
 And I didn't dream that I was a sex slave To a squid-like alien with your head.
 Jack, if this tv movie will help, Then I won't stand in the way of it.
 But I am gonna stay here and make sure The jessup name is not soiled.
 Of course, I'd love to have you.
 Uh, I mean, as a guest, not, uh, under a waterfall.
 I'm gonna go freshen up.
 The train was disgusting.
 I flew here, but I saw a train from the window.
 What are you doing? Leave.
 No.
 This is weird and I am not letting it get any weirder.
 All my life, I have been the third wheel That prevents people from having sex.
 Well, movie's over lizzie.
 Why don't you head on up to bed? Are you kidding? It's your anniversary.
 We're celebrating! Let's get these scabs off my knee.
 In college, they called me "the blocker".
 I don't need a chaperone.
 I'm sorry, but you're stressed and you're lonely And that woman has flawless skin, Like an organic chicken.
 I haven't had lunch.
 Oh, you're still here.
 That's what they all say.
 +  But I don't think there are any small jobs, Only small people, Like children, or a giant who's very far away from you.
 All I want is an opportunity, sir, to once again work For the greatest company that has ever existed Since the creation of earth 800 years ago.
 [as the nbc jingle]  I love this This is everything that jenna will be wearing in the movie, But of course, jenna isn't as slender-hipped As avery or, uh, you.
 Jessup women have terrible osteoporosis in later years.
 You must crumble like greek statues.
 You guys like factoids? Check this out.
 One in four americans has an std.
 Chlamydia, herpes, garden variety genital swelling-- That's quite enough, lemon.
 Rectal fissures.
 Lemon, a word.
 Actor time-out.
 Just wanted everyone to know that I'll be method acting; Staying in character at all times.
 It's a technique that was invented By constantin stanislavski When he was four years old And wanted to act like a pirate.
 Uh, this is lance drake mandrell.
 He'll be playing me in the movie.
 I'll beBecoming you.
 Easy, chief.
 Lance, this is diana jessup, avery's mother.
 Diana, are you a time-traveler? Because I don't know how my mother-in-law Could be younger than my wife.
 [flattered gasp] Was that supposed to be me saying that? Because I would never use that much math In complimenting a woman.
 Their brains can't handle it.
 [giggles] it's evolution.
 That's exactly the kind Of stuff I need to know.
 Hey, quick question, jack.
 Our underwear, is it regular black bikini cut? Or is it silk boxers with tweety bird on them? Because I have both.
 I think you and I should Have a meeting with wardrobe.
 The resemblance is quite striking, don't you think? The fighter pilot wrists, the hair like a mature otter's pelt, Shoulders you could ride bareback.
 I'm sure you don't wanna hear this, But every woman here would love to slip it to your son-in-law.
 Slip what? Whatever.
 Drill him against a wall.
 The point is, that would be wrong, Because we all work for jack.
 But boy, I'll tell you that lance drake mandrell Seems like the next best thing.
 Wouldn't mind giving him the old skin flute.
 Interesting.
 Okay, how about this?  don't say good-bye-- are you kidding me? Don't eat that pie, don't eat my fries, don't wear that tie, Don't smell that guy.
 We got to be better than this.
 All right.
  these lonely eyes-- I'm sorry, did you just say baloney thighs? Because that's the name of the boat weird al's gonna buy With the money he makes off youDumb bitch! I'm sorry.
 I just care too much.
 We might as well just write a song about pizza, Because at the end of the day, that's what it's gonna be.
 Oh, my god.
 If we did that, he'd be powerless.
 There's nothing you can change pizza to.
 Because it's already weird.
 Exactly.
 Weird al's about to get a taste of his own medicine.
 I'm jack donaghy.
 I am jack donaghy.
 [wretches] Oh, god.
 This ice tea is so strong.
 [knock on door] lance.
 I mean, jack.
 What do you need, diana? I'm very busy right now.
 I've got to get to the bottom of this business case.
 I wonder if you might say something negative About obama for me.
 "hope"? More like "nope".
 And what is your opinion on hybrid cars? Prius is the latin word for impotence.
 [sexually flustered] rose wine? Pairs well with failed suicide.
 Oh! Oh, you know, hey, this has been great practice, But I'm late for a tooth-whitening appointment And they just freak out if you don't Give them 24 hours-- no, no, no, no.
 Stay in character.
 There hasn't been a good Non-boat painting in 5,000 years.
 [moans] Sometimes to prevent monkey business, we must create it.
 The blocker.
 What do you want, lemon? I've gotta get to the bottom of this business case.
 Ugh, do you really have to be here, lance? I'm trying to find a quiet place to finish this rewrite.
 How is that rewrite coming? Maybe jack should go to the gym.
 You know, the actor playing him can do four boy pull-ups.
 Actually, jack, the rewrite is not going great Because I'm the only person willing to admit How messed up this situation is.
 Sounds like you need some advice.
 Ronald reagan use to say-- Stop right there, lance.
 Only nancy used reagan's first name.
 And only during bath time.
 You've got a long way to go before you're jack donaghy, But, my god, you do have amazing eyes.
 Thank you.
 Oh, hello jack.
 Both: Hello, diana.
 You can deal with liz, jack.
 I was on my way out anyway.
 Wait, where are you two going? Out for a drink.
 Stop acting like me.
 How is taking your mother-in-law Out on a date acting like you? Uh, it's not, obviously.
 Uh, you two go and have a good time.
 We will.
 It's impossible not to have a great time At planet hollywood.
 [wretches] Ice tea.
 [gags] Jack, there's a reason I can't write this the way you want it.
 I don't care if it's nancy or diana or your insistence That the jack character have an awesome catch-phrase.
 An idea that's off the charts, kemosabe.
 You're living in a dream world.
 Apparently because I thought you were a writer.
 Hey, I'm trying to help you.
 Who do you think got diana and lance together? The blocker? But of course that doesn't bother you, right? Because there's nothing going on Between you and diana, And your relationship with avery was perfect, And the only problem is that I can't write.
 That pretty much sums it up.
 You're fired, lemon.
 I'll write this thing myself.
 Fine, but you are in denial about your life.
 That's not a way out.
 + Hey, guys, it's me.
 Oh, my sandwich from the other day.
 I hate to waste food, but I'll probably get Free executive sandwiches like this forever.
 Nothing can stop me now.
 [squeals] It's okay.
 I'm doing great.
 Everything's gonna work out.
 Hang on, kid! We pool our tips.
 [musical lead-in] Now, here to sing her original song From the upcoming nbc television event Kidnapped by dangethe very talented jenna maroney.
  I eat pizza, I eat cheese   I eat lots of broccolis  I eat ice cream way too fast   burritos always give me gas   fart so loud, fart so loud   yum-yums make me fart so loud  Kingslayer! I've never been kissed like that, jack.
 It's because we're so in love, avery.
 That's why we're perfect, avery.
 Make love to meNow.
 This is garbage.
 [sighs] Oh, mr.
 Subhas, your wife is on the phone.
 She's making dinner and she wants to know If you found any prosciutto today.
 Why are you dressed like a janitor? It's my new job.
 But you just got promoted.
 Well, I've had a few setbacks, But only a quitter quits, sir.
 So, here I am.
 Starting back up the ladder to my dreams.
 My career dreams.
 Not the dream where those two tennis sisters chase me.
 You really are an extraordinary Young man, kenneth.
 No matter what happens, you always keep your chin up.
 Medically, it's a neck ridge.
 I mean, look at you.
 You're not just back where you started, You're doing worse.
 And even if other people say to you, "your life is a mess.
 Stop looking at your mother-in-law.
 I can't write your movie," You stay positive.
 You always believe that everything is going to work out.
 How do you do it? Well, I'll tell you my secret, sir.
 [whispering] I lie to myself.
 Every morning, when I wake up, I say, "everything's gonna be okay.
" But I'm lying.
 And I don't know how much longer I can do it.
 [piercing inhalation] Have a swell night, sir.
 Let me guess, you're all watching My triumph fallon last night? No, you gotta see this.
  daddy's fightin' overseas  lord, keep him safe for mommy, please   can't make up for time that's passed   but now he's coming home at last   heart so proud  heart so proud  daddy make my heart so proud  Yankovic! He reversed the parody.
 He normal al'd us.
 I feel so-- Honored? I've gotta go call my dad and thank him.
 You know he was stationed at pearl harbor? During the korean war? Well, congratulations, lemon.
 You were right.
 I've been lying to myself.
 Maybe my whole marriage to avery was a lie.
 Whoa, no, that's not what I was saying.
 Everyone lies to themselves.
 I mean, I refuse to buy larger underwear, And it looks like when you tie a string around a roast.
 Okay, so we agree.
 Things are complicated.
 But that doesn't mean you can't figure it all out.
 You just have to get avery home first.
 How? Lemon We can't make this movie.
 Yes, we can.
 We just have to do what you've been doing all along.
 LieTo everybody.
 [dramatic music] I'll never let you capture my wife from here, On the top of the empire state building! [groans] Korean freeze ray! Jack! Nothing can keep us apart! Our love is off the charts, kemosabe.
  I am kidnapped Cut! All right.
 [bell ringing] It's a wrap.
 All right, now let's hurry up and edit this thing.
 It's on in two days.
 Seriously, man.
 Call me.
 I wanna board with you at big bear, all right? Lance, I wanna thank you for you professionalism On this project.
 Thanks, jack.
 If it weren't for this gig, I never would have hooked up with diana.
 I'm not one to tell tales out of school, But she's a real hotshot at boinking.
 She boinks like a dog.
 I'm not a writer.
 She made me boink her this morning And at first, I was like, "please-- I get it, lance.
 Uh, thank you.
 Wow, it's just good to be, uh, Lance drake mandrell again.
 Get back to doing the things I love, Like getting high and going to the planetarium.
 So, thank you, jack.
 Hopefully, the next time we see each other, Avery will be home.
 It'll all work out, jack.
 Thanks, lemon.
 And, uh, thank the blocker for me.
 Hey, when this movie airs, Can my name be the first credit that comes up at the end? This is a group process, lemon.
 Don't be an egomaniac.
    

                




                    			 Here are all my receipts.
 Look, I don't need these, Liz.
 Your tax return is the same every year.
 Actually, I'll have you know that this has been a year of change, Howard.
 I joined an over-40 dance team, I started eating the lettuce on my plate under my onion rings, and I have taken up meditation thanks to my boyfriend Criss.
 Yeah, do you remember what you said to me last year? This has been a year of change, Howard.
 I'm actually eating the onion part of my onion rings, I started journaling thanks to my exciting relationship with Carol, who is a man.
 Although we have done nothing that lesbians could not do.
 Uhhuh.
 Do you remember what you said to me last year? I bought a restaurant-grade onion ringer, and I'm having a go at cycling, thanks to my boyfriend Wesley, whom I hate.
 Have I never washed this sweater? Look, there's nothing wrong with being predictable.
 Every morning I get up and come to this office while my wife cheats on me with Jared.
 Well, you're wrong.
 I bought a meditation stool, and This year's gonna be different.
 Jack, am I just in a permanent rut? I don't have time for your nonsense, Lemon.
 I'm working.
 I know this doesn't look like work, but are you familiar with the shower principle? I remember Mrs.
 Doyle pulling me aside to talk about it in the seventh grade.
 No.
 The shower principle is a term scientists use to describe moments of inspiration that occur when the brain is distracted from the problem at hand.
 For example, when you're showering.
 I was in the shower when I finally got the title of the movie Face off.
 Face off, face off.
 Exactly.
 If the cerebral cortex is distracted, by showering or putting, then another part of the brain, the anterior superior temporal gyrus is activated.
 This is the site of sudden cognitive inspiration.
 Nerd alert, nerd alert.
 The problem at hand is this man, my boss, Hank Hooper.
 Kabletown has grown a lot over the years, but it's still a family company with a very simple goal To entertain folks.
 That's all people want.
 To sit on their sofas Why am I putting on airs? To sit on their couches, and hear stories.
 Here's one.
 We were on patrol somewhere near the Cambodian border.
 We can skip this part.
 So we boiled the skull, and made a tea kettle out of it.
 My point is, I believe that slow and steady wins the race.
 We don't take risks.
 We make profits.
 So now, let's get this dog fashion show started! "Everyone hide your bones.
" "Dogbeard the pirate just sailed into woof harbor.
" You know what else Hank announced at that meeting? Record profits.
 Really? Can we start getting real soda? Because I think Corka-Coola brand diet banana lime causes "tum nungnuss.
" No.
 And do you know what Hank wants to do with that money? Pay a shareholder dividend.
 Meanwhile, the Kabletown blimp is in such disrepair, we got a "jeers" in Corporate Blimps Weekly.
 I want to use that money to transform this company, but first I have to convince Hank Hooper, a white man who still buys Cadillacs.
 I just need the right idea.
 Do you think a year ago today we were having this same conversation? Because it sure feels like it.
 Probably.
 And knowing you, as you were leaving you did something comically undignified.
 Well, not this time, friend.
 Gumballs! Lemon! S06 Ep15 The shower principle Why is all the healthy food on the top shelf today? Cut it out, you perverts.
 I know what you're doing.
 It's the first warm day of the year, and women are starting to take off their winter clothes Good morning! Eyes down here, boys.
 I have breasts, you know.
 Nope, Hazel.
 Button up.
 Cerie, put on one of my soup ponchos.
 This happens every spring, and it makes Jenna feel threatened, and old, and she takes it out on me and the show.
 Every year she Every year.
 The same thing happens every year.
 Take a picture, it'll last longer.
 Here you go.
 Liz, at 11:00 we have Our annual budget meeting.
 You know what I did a year ago today? Met with my accountant, went up to see Jack, told Cerie to cover herself up.
 Yeah, stop doing that.
 Paula canceled my subscription to shape magazine.
 Why do you have to take Cerie away too? 'Cause Jenna's gonna freak out, and she'll take it out on me.
 Last year, Jenna accused me of trying to destroy her because her lines didn't have any "K" sounds, which she thinks is the funniest sound.
 My God.
 My cousin Karl crashed his car, and now he's in a coma at the Kendall clinic.
 Well Look, you don't know what Jenna's gonna do.
 Yeah, I do.
 It's in the book, and the book has been right about everything.
 It can see the future.
 Well, hang on.
 If all of your problems are in the book, aren't the solutions in there too? Well, we'll see.
 Last year, Jenna didn't come to her senses till I It's all here.
 This is how I break the cycle.
 Today, I prove the universe, and my accountant, wrong.
 And, Pete, don't try to force a nickname this year.
 But I just bought a Letterman jacket with "the German" embroidered on it.
 It's not refundable if you personalize it! Jenna? I know you're gonna freak out today.
 You're trying to destroy me.
 I refuse to be in that sketch.
 The MacBeth sketch? Shh, stop it.
 You never say that name in the theater.
 It is curs-ed.
 Jenna, that's just a superstition.
 Elizabeth, I was trained in stage acting and game show pointing at the Royal Tampa Academy of dramatic tricks.
 Where I studied theater superstition, under Professor Duane "Crawfish" Kenny.
 I'm not doing a sketch about the Scottish play.
 Yeah, but this isn't MacBeth.
 It's a timely satire of MacBeth, where mayor McCheese and his wife, an ambitious pickle, murder king Ronald.
 Liz, I don't need any more bad luck.
 Do you know how many mirrors I've smashed just thinking it was a blonde woman mocking me? Okay, fine.
 Like last year I will Just ask Cerie to do it.
 Sure, I'll do it.
 I just have to be out in time for my band to be on Letterman.
 Perfect.
 Now everyone's happy.
 That Jenna sure is a handful, Hazel, damn it! I know she takes you for granted.
 But I don't.
 Say, I bought a groupon for a couples' massage at a resort in the Catskills where Henny Youngman used to take his mistresses.
 What do you say? No.
 But if you want to help me, just keep an eye on Jenna.
 I know she's gonna cave, I just want to make sure she doesn't do anything crazy first.
 As the doctor said to me after my hepatitis test, "you got it, sweetheart.
" Banks will provide Tray.
 Hold up, double "L".
 I just want to clear this level.
 To navigate the mortgage mess Tracy, that's the news.
 It's the only way we can watch it.
 Coming up next, how safe is your building's elevator? Yes! A thousand points! Sure.
 Tracy, I know you insist on doing your own taxes for some reason.
 I don't trust my accountant.
 I think he's lying to me about being Jewish.
 I step on more wine glasses than he does.
 Well, last year on this date, you flipped out because you didn't know it was the 14th.
 So, this is an early warning Wait, hold up.
 I didn't even know it was April.
 I was gonna tell Dotcom I loved his novel as an April fool's joke.
 This is all hands on deck! K-9, form of desk.
 Get the receipts out.
 This big one's for your sneakers.
 Yes, do your taxes, yes.
 Why do you look so weird? Have I never seen you carry a bag before? I went and took a shower at the Racquet Club, where I saw Lou Dobbs step on his own testicles.
 It was horrifying.
 Still trying to get the ol' jumper cables on the tires of your brain muffler? I don't know cars.
 I get ten minutes with Hank Hooper tonight.
 Ten minutes to convince him to change his company forever.
 This is a crossroads, Lemon.
 You know what I miss about G.
E.
? The factories.
 The sight of work being done, of things being made.
 The deafening noise of machinery.
 You have to talk like this! You can only say what's essential! And you get to point at things! Okay, well I, for one, am crushing it today.
 I pre-solved my Tracy and Jenna problems, my budget meeting with Pete took three seconds, and I got this meditation candle for 80% off.
 "Summer horse grave"? Did you say meditation candle? Lemon, are you planning to meditate? Yeah.
 I bought a meditation stool, I have a mantra.
 You have a mantra? What is it? You're not supposed to tell anybody what your mantra is.
 Come on.
 Meditation is a waste of time, like learning French, or kissing after sex.
 There you are, lemonade.
 Distract her with your craziness, Tracy.
 Otherwise she's going to meditate.
 I don't have time for that, J.
D.
 I have to go to Alaska immediately.
 Alaska, what are you talking about? Well, Ms.
 Lemon, Mr.
 Jordan had a lot more income this year than he anticipated, thanks to his frequent scratch-off lotto victories, finding all that treasure on the island he owns in the Caribbean.
 Quite an adventure.
 And designing Kate Middleton's wedding gown.
 She was wonderful.
 Collaborative, fun, and a little dangerous.
 Okay, so you have to go to Alaska because In order to pay my tax bill, I had to sign on to do a movie, Five dog now five.
 Gibberish.
 No, that's just the confusing title Disney gave the fifth Snow dogs movie.
 The "S" s are fives.
 Running time, 26 minutes.
 Why do you need to do a movie to pay your taxes? You're loaded.
 I'm not liquid, Liz Lemon.
 I'm completely solid.
 I took all of my money and put it in my pool and froze it.
 Nope, this isn't last year.
 I am breaking the cycle.
 I will deal with this later, after I meditate.
 Cycle? I forgot, I sponsored the dude that won the Tour de France.
 Add another zero, Ken.
 "Out, out, damn spot of mustard.
" This is the first time I've ever liked this show.
 It's so funny.
 There's a saying in show business.
 The show must go on.
 And I couldn't go another minute without being around the greatest non-pornography crew I've ever worked with.
 It feels so weird being up here.
 What if I get discovered?  Amazing   zing grace  I don't care if this production is cursed.
 Like Lady McCheese, I will "screw my courage to the sticking McNugget.
" I will do the sketch.
 Let me help you down, sweet.
 Careful, don't stab yourself.
 Okay, let's take it from Grimace's family being murdered.
 Jenna, look out! I could have been killed.
 It's the curse! Sorry.
 Hard "K" sounds.
 I'm going to Alaska! Five now dog five! Five now dog five! Everyone's trying to destroy me.
 Five now dog five! Five now dog five! Budget meeting, "the germ.
" Pam putch, car waiting times, "the germ.
" Distractions begone! Congratulations, Elizabeth.
 You have achieved transcendence, a state of pure inner peace, where all pants have built-in underwear.
 You have reached a plane of total enlightenment, and you are realizing that Jack was right, meditation is a waste of time, time you could have spent reading that book he gave you on business lunches, Buffett on buffets.
 But that doesn't make sense.
 If I've achieved enlightenment, how is this a waste of time? Let me answer your question with a question.
 Why don't you just shut up and tell me your mantra? Is it, "time to make the donuts"? What are you doing? "Hank Hooper is coming, Lemon.
 "I don't have time for your nonsense.
 "I'm always criticizing your shoes, but never offering solutions.
" Don't you have a big idea you're supposed to be coming up with? That's exactly what I'm trying to do.
 I realized something today.
 Putting, showering, they don't work for me.
 Only you can stimulate my anterior superior temporal gyrus.
 Buy me a drink first.
 For the past six years, nothing has been a better distraction than rescuing you from your various wrong turns on the road of life.
 And I just don't know what to do now.
 I'm scared, Jack.
 Lemon, just get another DVR in the bedroom, and then you can record all four shows at once.
 I've got it.
 Dump all the unsold dishwashers into the ocean.
 As it turns out, you are my shower principle, so shower me, Lemon.
 Shower me in the inane waters of television, food, and feet.
 You know what? Maybe you should try meditating.
 I am serious.
 The whole point is to clear your mind.
 Meditate, Lemon? I once pantsed deepak chopra while Craig T.
 Nelson taped it.
 I don't meditate.
 Liz, does your journal say anything about Frank trying to drink a gallon of milk last year? It can't be done.
 God, the carpet Somebody hold my hair back.
 No! My Johnny Choon.
 Are you all right? I've seen people killed with shoes, but never like that.
 I can't believe this is happening.
 I was just using the curse of the Scottish play as an excuse to act out.
 But it's real.
 Like I need another curse.
 Too busty.
 I'm running out of time.
 Meditate perfectly.
 Jack, tell me what to do about my Boyfriend! DVR! Feet! SMAS mondays at 10:00! Female mustache.
 My casserole's burning! My casserole's burnt! Nut up, Donaghy, and meditate! Congratulations, Jack.
 You have attained Shut up, I don't have time for this.
 Give me my inspiration.
 My God, you're good at meditating.
 The answer you seek has been there all along.
 It's right behind you.
 Behind you.
 Behind you, behind yo I don't need an echo.
 I heard you.
 Meditation over! Behind me.
 Behind me.
 I've got it! You know what they'd thought when I saw up your skirt.
 Nice.
 Someone won the crotch jackpot.
 I need a drink.
 My hand! But I'm auditioning to play senor wences' wife tomorrow! I can't take this any more.
 This curse is ruining my life.
 No, it's not.
 I am.
 What are you talking about? The light, your shoe, the chair, your hand.
 It was all me, Jenna.
 Wh why would you do that? Because, I want to be Liz Lemon's best friend.
 I want to know her secrets, sing Motown together into hairbrushes, have a pair of vintage Jordache jeans that we share.
 But, love has enemies You.
 So you tried to kill me? Of course not, silly.
 I can't afford a third strike.
 I just wanted to scare you off.
 And I'll stop, if you never speak to Liz again.
 Nice try, Hazel.
 But you made the same mistake Mickey Rourke made on that catamaran.
 You didn't kill me when you had the chance.
 Can I get you anything, Hank? Bottled water? I'm not fancy like that, Jack.
 If I get thirsty, I'll just drink the water from lunch I saved in my cheek.
 I've got one word for you, Hank Couches.
 I've been thinking about what you told the investors the other day.
 Kabletown fulfills our fellow Americans' most American need To sit on a couch, talking on the phone, about a TV show they're watching, based on a YouTube clip.
 Is NBC developing a show for that cat that jumps in the boxes? No, that's, uh yes! Heh! As a matter of fact, we are.
 But my point is, Kabletown controls nearly every aspect of that experience.
 The phone, Internet, TV, that's all us.
 But, we don't control the couch.
 Why are we outsourcing the American dream, Hank? Why are the couches our customers sit on made in I don't know Vietnam? Taking my original buttocks wasn't enough for those bastards.
 Here's what I want to do with our profits this quarter.
 I want to make couches, Hank.
 Kabletown couches.
 American couches.
 Boy, I do love a good couch, Jack.
 You know, I'm like a couch in a lot of ways.
 I fell asleep at a Raymour and Flanigan last week, and a black family tried to buy me.
 Let's do it! Let's make us some couches.
 You won't regret this, Hank.
 I only have three regrets in my life, Jack.
 Not buying the Phillies, not marrying my wife sooner, and not surprising you any quicker with this hug.
 Yup, same as last year.
 My situation has progressed in an interesting way, Liz Lemon.
 I don't want to hear it.
 To solve my tax problem, I called the treasury department and told them I won't pay my taxes until I see your president's birth certificate.
 They told me if I did that, they would arrest me.
 Things got heated, so I said I had a bomb.
 Hazel is trying to destroy me.
 Really? Now Hazel is trying to destroy you? Jenna, do you know how crazy you sound right now? Liz and I, or "Lazel," are really worried about you.
 My God.
 Doesn't matter what I do, nothing ever changes.
 Ms.
 Lemon, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need to get a recommendation from you to reapply to the NBC page program.
 We've already done that, Kenneth.
 We've done all of this! All I wanted was one shred of evidence that my life is moving forward.
 Baby doll, what about me? I'm new.
 Are you, Hazel? You're just another weird page, and I already have one of those.
 Thank you.
 You people, you are the reason my life is a stagnant, monotonous hell! No, that reminds me.
 My stand-up tour.
 Add another zero, Ken.
 Jack? Why did you invite me here? You're gonna murder me, aren't you? It's okay.
 Up here, Lemon.
 I haven't secured that level from the rats yet.
 What the hell is this place? This is where I remake Kabletown.
 And where Americans, and for cost reasons, quite a few "foreign Americans," will make couches.
 To watch TV on.
 Do I finally understand vertical integration? Yes.
 Well, at least one of us got out of their rut today.
 Lemon, what are you doing? I realized today that I cannot do my job without you.
 This is all because of you.
 You're admitting you need me, and all my nonsense.
 You haven't done that since You've never done that.
 I wanted a new G.
E.
 I got a couch factory, but it's a start.
 Baby steps, Lemon.
 To new beginnings.
 Lemon? The cycle is broken.
 Jack, the rats have my meditation stool.
 Help! Shoot it free! Let her go, you bastard! Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time.
 And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death.
 Out, out, brief candle.
 Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more.
 It is a tail told by an idiot, full sound of furry, signifying nothing.
 Would you like to try our apple dippers?   

                




                    			 I've finished my Cabletown self evaluation! Nailed it.
 "My greatest weakness is humility.
 I'm probably the most humble person in the whole world.
" I wrote that.
 These self-evaluations are a charade.
 People cannot be impartial about themselves.
 You should read what some of your coworkers wrote.
 What three words best describe me? The.
 Complete.
 Package.
 My greatest weakness Is chocolate.
 Surprisingly the only person who was honest was Jenna.
 None.
 "I am the worst person I know.
 "When I used to live with Liz, I would videotape her sleeping and sell it to Japanese businessmen"? No wonder that tour group kept calling me "sleep whore-San.
" No, no, no, no, no.
 Don't read that.
 I filled it out last night after mixing alcohol with prescription exhaustion.
 I need to redo it.
 I can't believe I have to read all of these.
 This is the biggest waste of time since NBC's diversity writing program.
 That was a good idea, but all of our actors are so white.
 Slap it to me, Daddy-O.
 Popo popped dookie down by the vacants.
 S06 Ep16 Nothing left to lose This is Jenna.
 What are you wearing? Jenna, love, it's English director Christopher Nolan.
 Mr.
 Nolan, I saw you across the room at the Dark Knight premiere.
 I was shooting blow darts at Maggie Gyllenhal from a heating vent.
 Yes.
 How would you like to be in my next movie? I quit this show! To hell with you all! Go to hell! I just need you to do a quick camera test for me.
 I do not understand Christopher Nolan's methods.
 He's directing a live-action Smurfs sequel, so I went to Times Square, did cartwheels like he asked Oh, boy.
 We got the whole thing on tape.
 This was a prank? This isn't body paint.
 It's a spray they use to kill geese at airports.
 What happened, J-Mo? Did you pass out in a goose costume at LaGuardia? What is that smell, Tracy? It's the new fragrance I designed.
 It's called "Desire," but with a "Z" instead of the second "E.
" What is that supposed to smell like? All my favorite things.
 The Knicks, a mop from a strip club, a carefree hobo, a crate with a new giraffe in it, and broccoli.
 It smells disgusting.
 Yeah, I wouldn't know.
 I lost my sense of smell years ago.
 But when one sense goes away, the others make up for it.
 I have an incredible sense of touch.
 I feel an old Jack-o-lantern from last Halloween.
 Are you serious? You can't smell? Why haven't you been to a doctor? Who has the time, with work, family and hobbies and listing excuses? Oh, my.
 It smells like grandma's house at Christmas.
 That's when we found her dead on the toilet.
 Pete, I spent the morning going over these Kabletown self-evaluations.
 Your evaluation gave me pause.
 Are you sure? Those look like hands to me.
 Here's the problem.
 In answer to the question, "where do you see yourself in five years?" You wrote, "right where I am.
" That's an unacceptable answer.
 I mean, what if the Wright brothers had said, "let's just keep making bicycles," or Alexander windowblinds had said, "no, I don't want to partially see outside"? Yeah, no, I get what you're saying, but I'm Pete Hornberger.
 The last time I tried to put myself out there, the girl turned out to be a cop.
 Do you understand how this attitude reflects on me? I am also required to complete one of these inane self-evaluations.
 It's a farce.
 What? Like Frasier? But that's fun But I can't say I'm succeeding as a manager if you're failing as an employee.
 You have no ambition, Pete.
 No, no, you don't understand.
 For me, that five years thing is very ambitious.
 Look at my life, Jack.
 My father was a congressman.
 I was valedictorian at St.
 Andrew's, an olympic archer, fourth guitarist in Loverboy As a teenager.
 It's almost unbelievable.
 If it weren't all true, I'd say it doesn't even make sense.
 But now look at me.
 The last two decades have been a freefall.
 If I could stay in the same place for the next five years, that would be a huge accomplishment.
 Do you know who you remind me of? George W.
 Bush, during his "let's do coke and buy the Texas rangers" phase.
 But he made a decision to be the best president ever and then he was.
 You've lost your mojo, Pete.
 And I'm going to get it back for you.
 Well, something is definitely obstructing your sinus cavity.
 Now we have two options.
 I can either drill a hole in the back of your head, and push it out with your brain Okay, that sounds good.
 Or I could just pull it out through your nostril.
 We'll do the second one.
 Thank you.
 You know, they don't tell you this until after you've paid for medical school, but being a doctor is exactly like the game "Operation.
" And there we go.
 My buck Rogers decoder ring! How long has that been in there? Those things are from the '70s.
 Yeah, you know what else is from the '70s? Women staying quiet.
 I totally remember this.
 When I was nine, I found it on the floor of the "G" train.
 I knew if my Foster mom saw it, she would make me sell it at a pawn shop to get our family a cheerio.
 Okay, sometimes I think the stories of your childhood poverty are exaggerated, but continue.
 So I hid the ring up my nose.
 I must have forgot about it.
 You may feel some burning and tingling, but you should regain normal sensation in just a few hours.
 I'm sorry, I was talking to my lover on my Bluetooth.
 One moment, suki.
 Anyway, Tracy, you should start regaining sensation in less than an hour.
 But a newly regained sense can be a very powerful thing.
 Even overwhelming.
 So if you do have an extreme reaction, please try to get it on video for my nephew's funny website.
 Liz, are you getting enough vitamin "C"? May I suggest messily eating an orange while I photograph it? Kenneth, what do you know about revenge? Well, the Bible says it's wrong, but it's the surprise hit of the season on ABC, so I don't know.
 Anyway, I know how busy you are, so I got you some more tattoo concealer.
 Thank you.
 I just ran out.
 I was so young when I got this.
 Who even remembers 2007? Wait, how did you know I was out of concealer? From your trash, Mrs.
 Maroney.
 The garbage man knows all.
 In this big trash bag, I see everyone's mistakes, their embarrassing secrets, their dreams they don't dare share with anyone.
 Like this.
 Interesting.
 Kenneth, you don't happen to have the other writers' trash in there, do you? No.
 I can't handle that much volume.
 I'm kidding.
 They call me "the natural.
" I'm so good, the other janitors just sit in the basement all day getting drunk and laughing about this idiot they know.
 No.
 Kenneth, this concealer is the wrong color.
 No.
 I'll be right back.
 Keep an eye on my trash cart? I'll keep an eye on it.
 Look at us, laughing together, like a couple of Jews watching The Daily Show.
 This is the gym of the New York racquet club, Pete.
 Theodore Roosevelt was a member here.
 In fact, many of the animal heads mounted downstairs were shot by T.
R.
 Including the one that looked like a terrified Asian man? It was a different time, Pete.
 Today, the most powerful men in New York still come here to exercise.
 And nothing is a better workout for body and soul than boxing.
 It's the first sport man ever invented.
 Except of course, uh, hide and seek.
 Shh.
 Yeah.
 Boxing is primal, Pete.
 It's exactly what you need.
 So come on, don't just stand there.
 Throw a punch, feel like a man.
 A man who, years ago, was on top of the world, who saw Paula and dragged her back to his cave.
 Actually she took me that first night.
 Hit something.
 Put your frustration into your fists and hit something! Hornberger! Get up, Pete.
 Get up and fight.
 For God's sake, Hornberger, the dummy is winning! Why are you kissing it? I'm submitting to its strength.
 It's the Alpha.
 Good morning, fresh coffee.
 Good morning, clean floor.
 Funny, Kenneth.
 You don't have any smell at all.
 Don't worry about it.
  Perfume and roses and strong halitosis   Powders and flowers and spicy clam chowders   I can smell, I can smell, I can smell   I can smell   I can  Daddy? Nice save.
 No.
 Vengeance announcement.
 Look what I found in the trash.
 An email confirmation in Frank's name for one ticket to see Taylor Swift at Nassau Coliseum.
 She writes the songs herself.
 When she can't cry any more, she writes! What are you laughing at, Toofer? You're the man who took professional boudoir photographs and then tried to mail them to Parade magazine columnist Marilyn Vos Savant.
 I happen to think that smart is sexy.
 Our foreplay would be puzzle-solving.
 Lutz's turn.
 What is this gonna be? No.
 I don't have anything for you.
 You don't matter.
 But if you two dirtbags ever mess with me again, I'll take this to the next level.
 You don't do 22 episodes of "Celebrity outhouse" with Lorena Bobbitt without learning a few things.
 You're at rehearsal before me? Of course I am, Liz-dad.
 I'm your good boy.
 I memorized all my lines, so can I go get dressed for the photo shoot now, so you don't have to wait for me? Sure, little buddy.
 You know, smell is the sense most closely associated with memory.
 I know, Dotcom, that's why whenever I smell that jacket, I remember being bored.
 The only person you're insulting with that attitude is yourself.
 Obviously something about the way I smell reminds Tracy of his dad.
 Well, his father did work for a soup factory and you are constantly eating.
 It's not a food thing, grizz.
 I think it's my hair pomade.
 Midnight symphony? My grandfather used that.
 Midnight symphony.
 You are the conductor of your own proud African orchestra.
 Midnight symphony.
 You use midnight symphony? It works, Dotcom.
 It was discontinued a few years ago, but I bought seven cases of it on eBay from a guy named Reggie.
 You're still here.
 You didn't go to the store for milk and heroin and then never come back.
 That was his excuse? You stayed because you love me.
 Right, daddy-Liz? I do love you champ.
 But I could love you more.
 Well, you just wait.
 Watch this.
 Be careful, Liz.
 Be very careful.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, Dotcom.
 Pete.
 Confidence is a spectrum.
 On one end, the ultra-confident end, you have people like Jack Donaghy, Vladimir Putin, Orville Redenbacher.
 Corn is not the only thing he popped, if you know what I mean.
 Then You have the other end of the spectrum.
 Yeah, I get it.
 Men with no confidence.
 No, men who have nothing left to lose.
 Great men like Richard Nixon, the 1980 olympic hockey team, my good friend John Rambo.
 This is you.
 And I shouldn't have been trying to get you all the way to the tiger, because all you needed was a little push to get you to nothing left to lose.
 This is how you get your mojo back, Pete.
 No, I am there, Jack.
 My job is killing me, my family resents me, the other day I was mugged by what I'm pretty sure was two five-year-olds in a trench coat.
 I already have nothing left to lose.
 No, you have one more thing.
 No.
 Not the ring.
 You're clinging to something that's gone, Pete, and it's not coming back.
 Allow yourself to be reborn.
 Your life is tied to the fate of the ring.
 It must be destroyed.
 Are you quoting Lord of the rings? No, I'm quoting myself talking to Bruce Willis.
 Well, well, well.
 If it isn't tweedle-Dee and tweedle-black.
 We need to talk about what you did.
 Well, you know what they say, boys.
 If you can't stand the heat, get off of Mickey Rourke's sex grill.
 No, this isn't about us.
 It's Lutz.
 I didn't do anything to Lutz.
 That's the problem.
 He has a thing about being left out of stuff.
 The man has self-esteem issues.
 I don't know why.
 Well, he is estranged from his son Kellan Lutz from Twilight.
 I'm sorry, are you asking me to apologize to him? Look, yeah, we mess with people, but there's a line we don't cross.
 For example, after you went through our trash, we went through yours.
 And we found this.
 My self-evaluation! I want to be famous to make people love me because I hate myself.
 The Jenna I talk to at night in the mirror thinks I should kill myself.
 Also, I caused that Italian cruise ship to crash.
 We could do a lot of damage with this.
 But we're not going to.
 Whatever.
 How's my boy? Working hard? So hard, papa Lemon.
 You're not gonna wanna run away and start a new family in Ohio and have a daughter you also name Tracy.
 Not if you're good.
 I've been thinking of some new characters for the show.
 This is my Jimmy Fallen impression.
 Awesome, awesome, I love it! It's my favorite! Tracy, that's great.
 Tracy, what's all this stuff? Just some stuff I needed from home, like my bed.
 It's a California Kong, which is two California kings tied together with gorilla leather.
 Wait, you're living here? I have to.
 Turns out Angie's cooking smells very ethnic, and I definitely can't be around my family.
 I didn't expect this, but teenage boys don't smell good.
 Wait, you can't be around your kids? What about baby Virginia? Do you know what she does in her underwear? Something I once did at the oscars that caused Daryl Hannah to throw up on me.
 Tracy, you can't just abandon your family.
 I've got all the family I need right here, L.
L.
 Now back to work.
 Philadelphia, 1776.
 "John Adams and Mitt Romney enter.
" Commentary! So stupid, Lutz.
 Disgusting.
 Why don't you learn your lesson and stop trying? That girl at Starbucks smiles at everybody, Lutz.
 Everybody! She doesn't want you to kiss her.
 No wonder people don't include you in things.
 No wonder Kellan never wants to see you again.
 You're worthless.
 Kenneth, be honest.
 Am I the worst person you know? Ms.
 Maroney, judging is for God and his angels.
 So, yes, you are.
 Where's the writers' trash? I've already taken it down to the sub-basement compacter room.
 The writers had me clean out their refrigerator today, so the trash smelled like, to use a technical janitorial term, total ass.
 Kellan, why? Okay, I know the answer to this, but I just need to hear it.
 If I have to choose between work productivity and what's best for one of my employees, I choose work, right? Great.
 Thank you.
 Something about my shoes.
 Good meeting.
 Which employee? What does it matter? It's Tracy and he has never been more productive.
 But he abandoned his family and his baby daughter to do it.
 Lemon, I invented business mumbling.
 You white garbage bag full of pudding.
 What? Look, when you're a supervisor, your job is to squeeze everything you can out of your employees, but there's a line and you've crossed it.
 Since when do you care about any line other than the bottom line? Sorkinesque Repartee.
 Because I'm doing it too.
 I'm taking advantage of Pete like you're taking advantage of Tracy.
 I said I'd fill out my self-evaluation after I'd fixed Pete.
 A task I knew deep down could never be accomplished.
 Yeah, he's a mess.
 But Pete's just an excuse.
 The fact is I can't fill this out because there's a question I don't know how to answer.
 "Where do you see yourself in five years?" For the first time in my career, I don't know.
 I could wind up anywhere.
 Running this company, making couches, serving as mayor of New York.
 Or I could be 6 feet under In the subterranean paradise we built to escape the poor.
 Yeah, I get it.
 As a writer, that uncertainty is the fate that always I am to face being.
 Well, I'm not used to it.
 But that's not Pete's problem, it's mine.
 You go talk to Tracy and I have to stop Pete from shaving his head.
 God.
 So, Lutz.
 You thought I left you off the hook the other day? Well, you wish.
 I spent the whole night going through the garbage trying to find the perfect thing to humiliate you.
 Yeah, we know.
 We took photos of you and sold them to a garbage fetish website.
 This was all a prank? I knew the mirror thing would get her.
 I'm so sad.
 I never talk to my son, Kellan.
 It's all made up, Jenna.
 Kellan Lutz isn't my son.
 He's my grandnephew and we're very close.
 Unbelievable.
 I was actually doing something nice for Lutz and My God.
 I was doing something nice.
 You took advantage of my niceness.
 Why are you smiling? You spent the night in our garbage.
 We win! No, I win.
 On my self-evaluation, I said I'm the worst person I know.
 But it's not true! Thanks to you guys, I'm the fourth worst.
  Jenna's amazing like a star in the sky   Jenna's amazing like a star in the sky  Pete, I apologize.
 I never should have told you how to live your life like some sort of American Barack Obama.
 Commentary.
 The truth of the matter is this whole thing wasn't even about you.
 It was about me.
 Really? 'Cause it seems like it was about me, Jack.
 Do you know what was under my hair? A birthmark.
 Good God.
 It looks like a swastika made out of penises.
 I know what it looks like! Since you've been "helping" me, my life has gotten worse.
 I broke my nose, a gay rabbi chased me through midtown, and last night, Paula wouldn't touch me looking like this.
 Do you know what it's like to try to have sex wearing a child's little orphan Annie wig? No.
 You know what? You've done enough.
 Get the hell out of my office.
 Congratulations, I knew I'd make a man out of you.
 Get out! There's the confidence.
 Please, just leave.
 Pete, you're welcome.
 You wanted to see me, smell? Sit down, champ.
 Why are you so heavy? 'Cause so much of me has died.
 Okay.
 Tracy, I'm so proud of you.
 You have grown into such a wonderful person for these last 24 hours.
 But when you're a father or even a father smell, sometimes you have to make sacrifices to do what's right for your family.
 I just wanna make you proud of me, L.
 L.
-Dad-Liz-dad.
 I know.
 But there's only one thing you need to do to make me proud.
 Pop dookie down by the vacants? Boy, if I had a dollar for every time I've been asked to reverse one of my procedures, my bitch ex-wife would be a millionaire.
 May she rest in peace.
 All right.
 Wait, Dr.
 Spaceman.
 There's so much I haven't smelled yet.
 A magnolia tree in spring, the towels at a miss Hawaiian tropic contest, the sweat of a terrified Webster as you load him into a Cannon.
 Tracy, you have to do this.
 Now, full disclosure, I lost your ring at a Bodeans concert, so I'm gonna shove this hilarious pencil-topper up there.
 Get a haircut, or I'm gonna shove you up a black guy's nose.
 Very well.
 You leave me no choice then.
 Goodbye, helpful Tracy.
 Goodbye daddy-head.
 Goodbye only evidence tying me to my ex-wife's disappearance.
 Five years from now? Well, I'd like to still be working for NBC, or whatever NBC is in five years.
 A T-shirt company probably? My greatest strength is that I'm a good listener.
 Watch.
 In five years, I hope I don't have to do this hat thing any more.
 In five years, I'll probably be dead and no one will even notice, and yes, this is my second attempt to writing my self evaluation.
   

                




                    			 Jack, I've got a huge problem.
 The TGS sweatshirts were supposed to say "TGS Season Six, Yuck," which is a catch-phrase from a pretty great sketch.
 Yuck! But they got misprinted and now they say, "TGS Season Six, Duck!" And that's a season five catchphrase.
 Duck!? Lemon, that is not a real problem.
 A real problem is losing your giant scissors right before a ribbon-cutting for a couch factory.
 I justhad them.
 Oh, thank God.
 I thought I'd lost them.
 Today I want everything to be perfect.
 I'm opening a factory.
 And factories provide three things this country desperately needs: Jobs, pride, and material for Bruce Springsteen songs.
 Great, so we solved your problem, but now I've gotta wear last year's sweatshirt to my cousin's wedding.
 Oh, I'm so tired.
 I was out all last night with my new rock star boyfriend.
 Oh, I listened to rock and roll music once, but I stopped before I started worshipping the devil.
 The song went, "Mr.
 Sandma--", then I shut it off.
 Morning, Jenna.
 Oh, thanks.
 Dating a musician is amazing.
 This sexual walkabout I'm on is really opening me up to new experiences.
 What's new? You've been with tons of musicians.
 Back in Chicago, I walked in on you with the guy from blues traveler.
 He still had his harmonica thing on.
 Sure, I've dated musicians before.
 But I've never sexually manipulated one into leaving his band for me.
 Like Yoko Ono and the Beatles, or Lance Drake Mandrell and Wilson Phillips.
 My boyfriend's last album went quadruple-platinum.
 They sold out Madison square garden in nine minutes, for a Tuesday morning show.
 Wait, who plays on a Tuesday morning? I don't know, just a little band called the Woggels.
  apples are red   bananas are yellow   I love my friends, bananas are yellow  My Russ is the blue one.
 He's about to do something amazing.
 Oh, I know the Woggels.
 My eight-year-old niece walked down the aisle to that song at her wedding.
 Wait, you're trying to break up a children's group? Well, it ticks off a lot of boxes on my sexual walkabout list.
 "Yoko a band, "make love to a beloved children's entertainer, be with a non-aboriginal Australian--" I thought the whole point of this was to see if someone could make you happier than Paul.
 I mean, if you're just checking off boxes, maybe you should get back together before it's too late.
 What's that supposed to mean? He's not replacing me.
 We're having an adventure.
 And I hope right now he is also with a beloved children's entertainer.
 Maybe Raffi.
 Or the sedated prisoner they put inside of Barney.
 Something terrible has happened! And for once I'm not talking about the collapse of the middle class.
 It's my family.
 My oldest son, George foreman, got into Stanford, and he's planning to attend.
 Tracy, that's awesome.
 Stanford's a great school.
 I didn't even get in, and I was first in my class.
 Although, only seven of us graduated that year because of a bad mono outbreak which somehow missed me, despite all the frenching I did.
 You don't understand.
 Jordan men don't go to college.
 We go to the school of hard knocks, a one-year vocational program where you learn to bang on doors and scare people into subscribing to magazines that they'll never get.
 Mr.
 Jordan, you should be proud.
 Proud? My son's a nerd! Tracy, in the real world, you need a college degree to succeed.
 Really, Dotcom? How did your city council campaign go? Well, as far as raising the level of discourse in this city? I'd say it was a great success.
 This is Angie's fault! She coddled him.
 I'm gonna teach my son what it is to be a Jordan.
 And I'm gonna die trying! Yes? Mr.
 Donaghy.
 This is Dr.
 Pravin Singh.
 I performed your mother's heart surgery last month.
 No, you must have the wrong Mr.
 Donaghy.
 My mother didn't have heart surgery.
 Colleen Donaghy.
 Born April 24, 1925, at Boston catholic guilt hospital.
 She keeps calling me Aladdin.
 That's definitely her.
 Well, she's recovering very nicely, but we don't have anyone to release her to.
 We found your name on a list of disappointments she keeps folded up in her shoe.
 Well, doctor, I can't come to the hospital to bring my mother home.
 I'm in New York, not Florida.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, I'm calling you from Cornell medical center.
 My mother's in New York? Dr.
 Singh, are you stealing my hats? What do you do, feed them to your cow God? Mother, what are you doing? Who told you to call my son? Oh, please, you wanted him to call.
 Somehow, you knew I was opening a sofa factory today.
 Could we just Ooh, sofa.
 Somebody got all flouncy when I wasn't looking.
 What are you gonna do, put on your galoshes and go eat some fruit, like a Frenchman? Fruit is part of a balanced diet, you miserable harridan.
 Good God! You've ruined every significant moment in my life.
 And now, you've ruined this.
 Jack, for God's sake, there's only one reason I came to New York, and that's because Gunga Din here takes my insurance.
 So you were planning on never telling me you were having heart surgery? Look, I do have other patients.
 Yes, I'm sure you do.
 Oh.
 Yes, I know it's over, Kouchie.
 Unlike you, I have eyes.
  Silly dinosaurs   this is just a list of things now let's list some more   a pogo stick   a hot air balloon   a hat that's full of soup   another pogo stick  Yeah! All right! Okay, all right.
 Where do you think you're going? I'm with Russ, Ian.
 What? You afraid my sexuality might tear this band apart? Listen here, Jenna.
 We're the Woggels.
 Nothing can tear us apart Except for the shark that got a hold of the fifth woggel.
  Basketballs hula hoops rollercoaster loop-the-loops   you just heard the Woggels sing   a very silly list of things  Woggel power! So to help your mother's weakened heart continue to beat, we implanted an "LVAD" device.
 Yes, I'm familiar with that.
 My good friend dick Cheney got one.
 A month later, he and I went hunting in Mexico.
 He shot thousands of doves that day and only hit me in the leg once.
 So, you know that it runs on rechargeable batteries? Like the flashlight in my race war preparedness bag.
 Mrs.
 Donaghy, the fact that you didn't call your son is worrisome.
 What good would he have been? He's useless in a hospital.
 I recall this one time he cried and cried.
 I mean, it was more like wailing.
 It was awful.
 She's referring to my birth.
 Look, I know this is a lot to process, so I'll leave you two alone to talk.
 About what? Can you believe this is the best room they have? This is supposed to be a hospital, not a Japanese internment camp I volunteered at during the war.
 Well, if you're not happy here I could put you up at the Plaza.
 You could look out at the park and watch carriage horses being whipped.
 I know how you love that.
 I can't go to the Plaza, and you know it.
 What if I run into Eloise? Am I supposed not to mention the fact that she has a gay grandson? Everybody knows! Well, then, of course I'd love to have you stay with me and Liddy.
 Liddy? Why couldn't you name the baby after my mother? Because at Ellis island, your mother's name was recorded as "unclaimed Irish stowaway.
" Son, we have a lot of work to do today if I'm gonna "reverse Urkel" you.
 Dad, I just want to read.
 Jordan men don't read.
 Grizz, tear this book in half.
 Son, I'm gonna show you how a real Jordan man enjoys himself.
 It's montage time.
 Tray, montage got married and quit stripping.
 Fine, we'll just do a series of activities.
  Gonna build a daydream   Uh-huh   from a little hope   Uh-huh   gonna push that daydream   Uh-huh   up a mountain slope   Uh-huh   gonna build a daydream   Yeah yeah   gonna see it through   Yeah yeah   gonna build a mountain and a daydream   gonna make 'em both come true   yeah yeah   Gonna build a heaven   from a little hell   Little hell   gonna build a heaven   and I know darn well   Darn well   if I build my mountain   Yeah yeah   with a lot of care   Yeah yeah   and take my daydream up the mountain   heaven will be waiting there   gonna build a mountain gonna build it high   I don't know how I'm gonna do it   I only know I'm gonna try  Well, Colleen ruined the ribbon-cutting.
 She's in New York.
 She's been here for weeks, recovering from heart surgery.
 Oh, my God, is she okay? She's fine.
 They gave her the same heart pump dick Cheney had.
 Next thing you know, they'll be giving her his retractable wings and rocket arms.
 She's going to bury us all.
 Jack, your mom's 87.
 Do you think maybe she had the surgery in New York to be close to you, so you guys could, you know, have the talk? "The talk"? Lemon, my mother did explain sex to me, three years ago.
 There weredrawings.
 No, I mean,the talk.
 Your mom's heart doesn't work.
 You need to sit down and say how you feel so you don't have any regrets.
 I've done it, Jack, and it isn't easy, but it's very rewarding.
 You talk in your sleep.
 I know what you did in the war, and before you die, I want you to know that I know.
 I know you Donaghys think you're so tough, but Colleen is here because she's trying to reach out to you.
 Just get in the same room with her, and the talk will happen.
 I guar-on-tee.
 I don't know why I said that.
 This is such a serious conversation.
 I'm sorry.
 Uh, Lemon, I assure you, my mother is not in New York to spend time with me.
 She already wants to leave my apartment because Liddy is "giving her the stink eye.
" As soon as she feels up to it, she is going back to Florida.
 There was no need for us to start jabbering about our feelings and sobbing like Bill Belichick listening to Adele.
 Okay, fine.
 But you and your mom-- Nope.
 As my coffee cup said this morning, "you only regret the things you didn't do.
 This cup was made from recycled toilet paper.
" Don't let Colleen leave without saying what you need to say.
 Last word.
 Damn it!  I'm a kangaroo, I'm a kangaroo   loot da doo da doo  What is that? Oh, it's nothing.
 It's just a song I've been fiddling with.
 Or, as we say in Australia, a song I've been fiddling wazzle.
 It's good.
 It's really good.
 And this is coming from someone Quincy Jones once pushed off a boat.
 So, why does Ian write all the songs? He's just keeping you down, because he knows you're the real genius of the Woggels.
 Really? Do you think so, Jenna? It doesn't matter what this brain thinks.
 It matters what this brain thinks.
 Lemon, there you are.
 Good morning, Jack.
 Did you talk to Colleen? If you're ordering me an edible arrangement to say thanks, I'd prefer a meat one.
 Yes, Colleen and I did talk.
 Specifically, she said a car was circling the block, "casing the house.
" I tried to explain that those were all different taxi cabs, and she said, "then why is the same man driving all of them," and insisted on leaving.
 She won't go to a hotel, and she hates the Princeton club, because Dean Cain is always there hoping to get recognized.
 I tried to leave her at the Bodies" exhibit-- God, that is all just a smoke screen.
 She's acting out because she wants to have the conversation, and you won't meet her halfway.
 I decided something last night after I got your tenth text message, one of which was an inscrutable emoticon.
 Hold it sideways, it's me going like this: "Talk to your mother!" The "8" is my glasses.
 Yes, someday, my mother is going to die, and we're going to deal with it our way.
 Well, your way is wrong, and I bet Colleen agrees with me.
 I'm glad you said that, Lemon.
 Good luck.
 Ah, Elizabeth.
 Can we do something about the temperature in here? I'd like it humid and cold.
 Duck! Yoko announcement.
 Russ wrote a song.
 A great song.
 And if you don't sing it at the Gwammys, which is the Grammys for toddlers, Russ is going solo.
 Russ, I write the songs here, so you have to choose.
 Her, or us? Come on, mate, Woggel power.
 In Australia, "woggel" means "white.
" Hm.
 Let's get out of here.
 I want to lick that turtleneck off of you.
 Yeah.
 Come on, Jenna.
 Fine, leave.
 We'll just replace you.
 Anyone can be replaced.
 Especially girlfriends.
 No, you don't know what you're talking about.
 Paul isn't gonna-- I mean, Russ.
 Paul is American for Russ.
 Oh.
 Ugh, Dean Cain.
 You know what? I'm glad Jack put you in here.
 Because I think we need to talk, about talking.
 What's the matter with you? Are you on drugs or something? Don't you think, at a certain point in life, parents and children should sit down and express their feelings before it's too late? God on a wheel! Jackie and I know how we feel.
 We don't have to say it out loud like a couple of gays getting married in jean shorts in Provincetown while I'm just trying to enjoy an ice cream on the pier! Okay, fine.
 If I can't convince you, maybe you'll listen to the words of Mike and the mechanics, whose song The Living Years I definitely remember.
 "Say it out, speak it clear.
 "You should listen, dude.
 Also, hear.
 It's too late, when--" You have two minutes to find that battery before I die.
 You guys do not like talking! Great news, everyone! George foreman is not going to Stanford.
 He's decided to permanently join the entourage.
 I'll start the paperwork.
 Wait, he's not going to college? Look, yesterday was the first time I've ever spent the day with my dad like that, and I just want to keep doing it.
 You need to take him to security.
 It takes a week to get an I.
D.
 Tony will rush it for me.
 We do zumba together.
 My son is 17.
 Have I really never spent a day with him doing father and son stuff? Like teaching him how to ride a bike Down the Luxor pyramid.
 Or drive a car Vel franchise into the ground.
 I never even taught him how to shave An orangutan.
 Well, sir That doesn't mean you're a bad father.
 Yes, it does.
 I haven't been there for him since day one.
 Hey, Angie.
 What's up? You had the baby? Okay.
 Name him George foreman.
 And also, we're out of soda at home.
 Lamont, hurry up and deliver that baby before they realize we're not doctors.
 But I'm finally connecting with my son, and he wants to be here.
 I don't know what to do.
 I wish I had a father to talk to.
 But Liz Lemon is the only person I know who even has a father.
 Well, Mr.
 Jordan, speaking from experience, All My Children was cancelled.
 As you can see, I'm out of my wheelhouse here.
 But, if you want to talk about wheelhouses-- Liz Lemon it is.
  I'm a little Joey a baby kangaroo   jumped out of mommy's pouch   and now I don't know what to do   I wanted to go walkabout, around the world I roamed   but now the fun is over, and I want to get back home   mommy kangaroo mommy kangaroo   separate the races, mommy kangaroo  Oh, God.
 It's all been a terrible mistake.
 You don't just jump out of the pouch and walk away from something so good, something that makes you happy.
 Wait.
 Are you saying I should go back to the Woggels? The what? No.
 That song, like everything, is about me.
 I'm the baby kangaroo who went on the walkabout.
 What have I done? My driver will take you to the airport.
 I'm glad you're feeling well enough to travel.
 Jack, can we make sure the pilot is a man.
 I don't know, ever since Amelia Earhart, I'm a little skittish about lady pilots.
 Yes, mother, captain Chuck cutler.
 I'm told he has a mustache.
 Mm, good.
 Good-bye, mother.
 I know it won't be welcome, but I will point out that this is your final "talk-portunity.
" Not another word, Lemon.
 Sew up your cabbage hole, girl.
 Lime to a Lemon, you need to tell me what to do about George foreman.
 Liz, has this whole walkabout thing been a mistake? Jenna made me forget about What if I'm already too late? Why I came here, so I guess What if Paul's actually I'll just go to the beach.
 Replaced me? Both of you need to stop right there.
 If you are having a problem with a loved one, there is only one thing you need to do.
 Communicate! Go to Paul, go to George foreman.
 And as difficult as it might be, talk to them.
 Before you lose them forever, tell them how you feel.
 Have the talk.
 George foreman first, dinner break, then Paul.
 I'm sorry, was that supposed to be for our benefit? Do you think we're idiots? If you were my kid, I'd mail you back to the stork.
 She's not kidding.
 When I was eight, she took me to the post office because I spilled juice on a couch reserved for the pope, which has still never been used.
 He'll come.
 But I am sorry I tried to mail you.
 I forgive you.
 And I'm sorry about the juice, which you should know was actually wine.
 I forgive you, too.
 You know, you've always been my favorite child.
 Thank you.
 You never gave me any trouble.
 You always ate your vegetables, you went to church, and you loved breast feeding.
 I just wanted to make you proud of me.
 That's all I ever wanted.
 If I've ever had any success in this life, it's because of you.
 Oh.
 I made this happen! Not a part of this, I get it.
 But I made this happen! I made this happen.
 Son, this isn't easy for me to say, because my tongue caught what my foot has.
 But I need to say it.
 You should do what's best for you.
 Look, I want to go to college, but I love you, dad.
 And I'm gonna love you no matter what.
 Even if you become a doctor, or a lawyer, or a philanthropist who devotes his life to others.
 I'll still be proud of you.
 Good-bye, my son.
 But dad, college doesn't start for another five months.
 I said, good-bye, my son.
 Great.
 Now let's go do my thing.
 Okay.
 Oh, God.
 He's dressed like her.
 I'm too late.
 I've been replaced.
 Kouchie? Look on the bright side.
 My thing went perfectly.
 I have something for you.
 It's not much, but I thought maybe you could put it in Liddy's room.
 Oh.
 Oh.
 This was your mother's.
 Well, I know, but I wanted to make sure you got it.
 Hang on.
 If your plan was to have surgery, then go back to Florida without ever seeing me, why did you bring this with you? What is this, the Spanish inquisition? Oh, you'd know.
 You lived through it.
 Oh.
 Getoff.
 Ow! Getoff.
 I did this!  Feelings feelings feelings say how you feel   Apples   You taste good   Trees   You give us wood   Grandma   I am gay   Bridge   You turn me on in a sexual way    

                




                    			  Cleanup, cleanup   do your own housework, you little crackers  what? My kindergarten teacher was a former black panther.
 Oh.
 Hey, I'm gonna fix that loose baseboard upstairs.
 Wow, look at you, all sweaty with your tool belt and your '90s haircut.
 You look like you're in a gay porno.
 Oh, yeah? You're one to talk, buddy.
 I'm Brent.
 I'm the new guy on the crew.
 I'm Rod.
 I'm the boss.
 And what I say goes.
 I've never been with a man before.
 Looks like I'm the boss now Rod.
 Oh! What are we doing? I don't know.
 Whatever! Let's wrestle! It doesn't matter.
 Liz, what is "adoption stuff"? Are you adopting a kid? No.
 Don't worry.
 That's from a long time ago.
 It's not happening.
 You have a baby name book, and you circled Adolf? Actually, I borrowed that book from my mother, so be glad I'm not a boy.
 Okay, well, why'd you give up on it? I have to work late tonight.
 What am I gonna do with Joshua? I thought I could do this by myself.
 You know what? Murphy brown lied to us.
 She had Eldin.
 Can you hold that, please? You closed the door on her? The point, Criss, is I didn't want to be that woman.
 I didn't want to do it alone.
 But let's face it.
 Murphy Brown had the whole fyi gang in her corner Jim Dial, Frank Fontana, Corky, even Miles, in his own way.
 Yeah, but you're not alone now, and if a kid is something that you still want, and you're in your 40s, then We should we should have a we should have a serious conversation right now.
 Oh, my God, relax.
 This is my life, and I love it.
 I've got my job, and I've got you, and I keep getting my neighborallure magazine.
 If there's anything that needs fixing in my life, it's a certain loose baseboard.
 Okay, well, I'm gonna fix it.
 And do not send Brent up there.
 I won't.
 Dude, I'm back from the hardware store.
 this country's taken some hits lately.
 But when we get hit and are down, we don't stay down.
 We get up, and we hit back with our fists or our nunchakus.
 And then, when we're done hitting and we're tired, 'cause nunchaku-ing can wear a guy out, we sit down on a couch, an American couch A Kouchtown couch.
 Damn.
 Lemon, do you know you are sitting on 5,000 new jobs? And not jobs that came from some government bailout.
 They came from a rich white guy.
 We have been creating and solving this country's pRoblems for 200 years.
 Where's our history month? It is a nice couch.
 Good lumbar support.
 Absorbent fabric for nap drool.
 That's just the prototype.
 As we speak, our fellow countrymen are rolling the new Kabletown couches off the assembly line, earning an honest day's pay so they can go to the store and buy milk for their families, which costs I don't know, $90 a gallon? I'm meeting with the vendors tomorrow, Raymour and his conjoined twin, Flanigan.
 Ashley of Ashley furniture will be there, and he is a genitally androgynous pinhead.
 Hmm.
 It's a colorful industry with a lot of fun characters.
 Well, good luck fixing America.
 I hope success isn't far, far away.
 What aboutstar wars do you want to say, lemon? Let's just get to it.
 I did some spring cleaning this morning, and I found this baby princess Leia costume that I bought years ago, and I thought it might fit Liddy.
 Oh, thank you, lemon.
 It might be a bit small by Halloween.
 Halloween? A girl can wear this anywhere.
 School, church, alone on the playground, a child therapist's office.
 Also, I thought you might want this Nixon biography that my dad gave me for my birthday.
 It had just come out, so as a joke, my dad signed it as Nixon.
 Yes, a joke.
 Nixon's been dead almost 20 years, not in cryogenic hibernation, resting up for 2016.
 I'm getting rid of all my junk so Criss can redo the upstairs.
 Wow, you two are really nesting.
 Yeah, all that's missing is the joint answering machine message.
 I'm thinking Sonny and Cher.
 Lemon, I know how this will be received, but before it's too late, let me set you up with someone.
 Oh, my God.
 Come on, Jack.
 My colleague is newly single.
 His name is Kevin.
 I'm gonna stop you at Kevin.
 Has anyone ever known a good person named Kevin? Kevin garnett helped me move once.
 I'm good, thanks.
 Kevin costner cooked me dinner after a bad breakup.
 Kevin Sorbo intRoduced me to his podiatrist.
 This is an outrage.
 I didn't get to work an hour late just to be the first one here.
 I'm sorry, tray.
 I don't know where Jenna is.
 I'm sorry I'm late.
 I was busy burning down the panda express that I had fallen in love with.
 Oh, my God, Jenna.
 Are you okay? I'm fine, Liz.
 I'm just having a celebrity breakdown.
 It's the new sex tape.
 Something I wish I'd known before I released my sex tape with the six flags guy.
 So this is just for attention? Exactly.
 Anyone who's anyone has had a breakdown.
 "Da-mi", "de-mi", Heather, Lindsay, Britney, Muammar so sad.
 A life cut short.
 He gave the best diamonds.
 Okay, good.
 I thought maybe you were really losing it, because, you know, Paul's with someone else and oh, no.
 This is for Paul.
 You see, when you have a breakdown, all your old lovers come out of the woodwork.
 Justin and K-fed, Bruce and Ashton, Samantha Ronson and Herbie the Lovebug.
 This is how I get Paul back.
 Wow, that is idiotic.
 But as long as it doesn't affect work what's that, celestia? All right.
 I'll do it.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, hi.
 I'm Stewart der.
 I'm the chief engineer here at Kouchtown.
 Do you know the history of this building, Stewart? During world war ii, the Bazooka Joe corporation used a softer version of their gum to make armor-piercing bullets Here.
 Years later, the government took it over.
 They turned it into a training facility for single mothers to teach illegal immigrants how to fill out unemployment forms.
 But then we took it back.
 Ah, good morning, fellow patriots.
 Keep voting republican.
 We've got your back.
 Now let me have a look at this marvel of American industry.
 Good God! This doesn't look like the prototype.
 Looks more like the prototype than most things in this world.
 How could this happen? The one in my office was perfect.
 Oh, we didn't make the prototype.
 We bought it at west elm.
 Besides you, whom do I fire for this? I don't know.
 You? I mean, you're the one who insisted on hiring American engineers.
 All they teach us now is how to build rollercoasters and survivor challenges.
 This is what we've been making for the past month? We have 10,000 of these? I wouldn't know.
 I'm not a math guy, really.
 This is only a setback.
 I just have to create a market for terrible couches.
 Besides, what did Theodore "Bazooka" Joe do when his eccentric millionaire father left him nothing but a tiny pink rock quarry? He baked those rocks and sold them to children.
 As gum.
 Tracy, I need your input.
 I cannot give it to you.
 I'm a married man.
 But more importantly, I find you very unattractive.
 No, I need your advice.
 I'm having a celebrity breakdown.
 I've been there, j-mo.
 What's the matter? Partying too hard with Christian slater? Furious about Nafta? Y2k panic? My heyday was the '90s.
 No, Tracy, I'm faking it to get Paul to come back and take care of me.
 Fake breakdown.
 Interesting.
 I thought next I'd go nuts on thetodayshow, really blow it out.
 Jenna! Did Hamlet start the play by stabbing people? No.
 He started by being boring and ruining my anniversary, 'cause Angie wanted to take advantage of "all the great theatre in New York".
 Okay, I get it.
 You have to build to the big breakdown, like in a c+c music factory song.
 My heyday was also the '90s.
 So what have you done so far? Well, I've acted crazy at work.
 And I think this blind item in the post is about me.
 "What teenage a-lister" get serious! We have work to do.
 Hey, want to watch Mythbusters? Mm.
 Can we have sex after? 'Cause those guys always put fuel in my tank.
 Who is cigarfan@nbcuni.
Com? "Avail 4 javamanana per Jack.
 Deets 2 follow.
 Kev" who is kev? Oh, my God.
 He gave him my email? Who gave who your email? Okay, I know you're not gonna be threatened or jealous about this.
 'Cause I got it going on? Jack is trying to set me up with some d-bag he works with.
 "Sent from one of my four iPads"? This guy sounds amazing.
 Obviously, I'm not going.
 Let me just write him back in his language.
 "Broseph.
 Sor-sor on the haps" no, you know what? You should go.
 What, are you kidding? No, if you don't go, you're not gonna be able to tell Jack how wrong he is.
 If you do go just have coffee with this guy, maybe Jack will shut up, and I'll finally get the acceptance that, you know, every 39-year-old man craves from his girlfriend's boss.
 I do like telling Jack when he's wrong.
 And maybe Kevin will insist on paying, and I can get a jazz cd and a ham sandwich.
 "Dudely, let's make coffee our bitch.
" When did we get so soft? You know what this country used to sit on? Logs.
 Girders.
 Poles.
 Being comfortable? That's not what America's all about.
 Kouchtown.
 Sit down or get out of the way.
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
 Help, I can't move.
 Tell me, can you even look at the television? I can see the floor.
 I can see the veins behind my eyes.
 Oh! I can see pain! Come.
 My whole body is asleep.
 Oh! That's a bad couch, Jack.
 It is unfortunate.
 The design forces the sitter into what Israeli military interrogators call a stress position.
 Oh.
 It cuts off circulation to the legs while simultaneously spreading out the ribcage, making it difficult to breathe while the body begs for oxygenated blood.
 It comes in espresso, dandelion, putty, and, as you see here, lagoon.
 So you're gonna just try to sell discomfort? I don't have a choice.
 If I blow this, Hank hooper will never give me another shot.
 I'll spend the rest of my career behind this desk trying to lure alf back to television.
 Okay, Jack.
 Well, I'm gonna go meet your buddy Kevin now.
 Yes, he mentioned you were getting together.
 And you certainly are dressed to impress.
 You look like a substitute teacher who just got her one-year a.
A.
 Chip.
 Well, I'm just doing this as a formality, Jack.
 Lemon, I know you don't trust me, but keep an open mind.
 I'll do my best, but I watched, like, thrMythbusters last night, so I'm pretty exhausted, if you know what I mean.
 Our next guest has had a troubling 24 hours that has the tabloids talking and her friends Concerned.
 Let's take a look.
 Thank you.
 Dhanalakshmi, I'm happy for you, and I'm gonna let you finish, but I just gotta say, Gurubarath Kurrupuswami spelled one of the toughest words of all time! That's yesterday afternoon.
 Here you are earlier this morning being asked to leave dick Cavett's birthday party.
 That's unfortunate.
 Then a kleptomania relapse ending in orgasm and arrest.
 Wow, Jenna Maroney has gone crazy.
 She sure has, said the second guy.
 Jenna, I know a lot of people are asking, are you okay? Matthew, I'd really prefer to just talk about my upcoming project.
 Me running through that window.
 Aah! Right this way, folks.
 Mr.
 Donaghy will be with you in just a moment.
 I'm so sorry.
 Where I'm from, Uncle Sam's mouth is sewn up, and then he's set on fire, so I don't know how he talks.
 Greetings, gentlemen and female eunuchs of the furniture industry.
 I give you a new couch for a new era, designed and manufactured in America.
 It's a simple couch.
 Oh, good God, my leg! I can hack it.
 Pain is in the mind.
 Oh, sweet heaven.
 It's like I'm full of lightning.
 Jack, it's Ethan Allen.
 Are you all right? What do you want to know? I'll tell you anything to make it stop.
 You want secrets? I'll give you secrets.
 This couch Is a failure.
 I hate golf.
 One time in college, I smoked a clove cigarette.
 I keep buying candles as gifts and keeping them for myself.
 My natural hair color is bright red.
 Agh! Amateur hour.
 Ugh! Agh.
 Good luck finding someone stupid enough to buy those couches, Donaghy.
 Everybody loCate your buddy, and let's make our way to the subway.
 I'm sorry, sir.
 If I could buy your couches, I would.
 You know, that's exactly what you'll do.
 Okay.
 And will you accept dancing as money? Kenneth.
 Drag me to my office.
 Agh! I issued a statement on your behalf using Twitter.
 A media-savvy crackhead, I know.
 I said that you were being treated for exhaustion and that you wanted to thank your fans for all their support, and also, you saw Tracy Jordan do 11 pushups.
 I just hope this works.
 Well, some of your former loved ones are already here.
 David Blaine.
 I can see that you're on a skateboard, David.
 This is why we broke up, Jenna.
 I know we only spent one night together.
 I don't know what you're talking about.
 That never happened.
 Sure it did.
 I ate a pizza slice off your back.
 At one point, your veneers fell off, and you had these little baby fangs.
 Thank you, Frank.
 It feels like only yesterday you were in my gym class, Jenna.
 Now, you weren't the only student I dated, but you were the only one who shot my wife.
 Jmo, these are from Mickey Rourke.
 No! Tracy, put them down! I don't know.
 Maybe 'cause I'm a season ticket holder? Hi, you must be kevi no.
 No, let me fin let me finish.
 Are you He's my dad.
 It's "take your daughter to work" day, which I object to on feminist grounds.
 It's patronizing.
 Like girls don't know what jobs are.
 I'm Liz, by the way.
 I'm Catherine, but everyone calls me Cat.
 Although I'm trying to get people at school to call me scout, like in to kill a mockingbird.
 I love that book.
 I had my first crush on a shop teacher who looked just like Boo Radley.
 Yeah, scout's not getting much traction, though.
 Well, it's hard to force a nickname.
 I tried to get my high school tennis team to call me ace, but they wanted to call me shorts accident.
 So we settled on supervirgin.
 Okay, so I might not get scout, but I can negotiate up from puked in thermos.
 Well, then, let me ask you this.
 Would Jeremy lin be willing to videotape a message for my buddy's bachelor party? Ugh.
 Sorry.
 She's with me.
 It's "take your daughter to work" day, and Kabletown's really into all this family shiz.
 So what have you learned today? That people who talk the most in meetings often know the least.
 She sat in two meetings with me.
 I crushed it.
 So what's your deal? You ski? I don't.
 You know, if I'm gonna fall down a hill and die, I want to do it for free.
 Brian.
 What is up, slick? Do you think I could pull off a haircut like scout had in the movie? I've been there, Cat, and you should know that people are gonna assume that you're I'm a lesbian? I know.
 I just needed to hear it.
 So, what do you want to be when you grow up? Either the wicked queen inDisney on ice or the third woman president.
 Well played.
 I am giving you gum for that.
 Where is he? Where is "kev"? It's game go.
 What are you doing? What game go is not a phrase.
 I don't know.
 I just got really wound up at the thought of you getting checked out by some creep.
 And he's in trouble, too, 'cause I watched some boxercise videos on demand before coming down here.
 Hi.
 I'm Criss.
 This is Cat.
 This is Kevin's daughter.
 She's awesome, unlike Kevin, who is wearing a rope bracelet.
 And I did not give it to him.
 People assume I gave it to him, but I'm like, "you're not pinning that on me.
" I can't believe you really came down here to try to fight my date.
 That hasn't happened to me since senior prom, when Rob Sussman tried to fight Richard Sallatto because they had secretly broken up with each other the night before.
 Why are you so out of breath? 'Cause I ran all the way down here.
 Why didn't you just take the subway? 'Cause that's not romantic.
 Watch a movie, Liz.
 I wish my boyfriend did stuff like this, but I feel the passion is gone since he left for college.
 I'm totally messing with you.
 Guys, I'm 11.
 Oh, thank God.
 That is not funny, young lady.
 It's a little funny.
 I'm sorry, j-mo.
 I called the front desk, but there's no one else down there.
 Paul didn't come.
 I guess I faked this stupid breakdown for nothing.
 Jenna, I've been thinking.
 Why? You're famous.
 I know, but I don't think you were faking anything here.
 Maroney, you jumped through a window.
 You made out with paz de LA huerta at a children's museum.
 You tried to dine at balthazar without a reservation! And you did all that to get some guy's attention.
 That's crazy.
 That's a breakdown.
 I think I've made the biggest mistake of my life.
 I've never made a mistake, so I don't totally understand, but I'm here for you, J.
 Of all the crazy things I did, you know what the craziest was? Letting Paul go.
 I was scared to be happy.
 Now I never will be.
 I'll take this regret to my grave.
 You mean our grave.
 Where we'll lie on top of each other in one coffin, pelvis to face, for eternity.
 You were here the whole time, taking care of me.
 I was afraid too, Jenna.
 I had to be sure that you wanted the same thing that I did.
 And now I know.
 You sick bitch.
 Tracy, if you'll excuse us.
 No, Paul.
 If it wasn't for Tracy, we wouldn't be here right now.
 He can stay.
 No, I'm cool.
 I'm gonna leave.
 Lemon, how did your date go? It was amazing, but not in the way that you would expect.
 Cat's a great kid, isn't she? You really thought I'd set you up with Kevin? I've been trying to fire him ever since he invited me out on a Halloween party bus.
 But his daughter's terrific.
 So you set me up on a play date? I thought Kat would remind you why you purchased the princess Leia costume in the first place.
 Don't give it away just yet.
 That's very nice of you, Jack, but you need to learn that some women choose to be childless and are content with that.
 This is not a choice.
 Oh, you are being so trans-vaginal right now.
 The past few days have only confirmed my fear that we're running out of good Americans, so honestly, your country needs a few more Liz lemons.
 Oh.
 Okay.
 So this has nothing to do with Criss? I don't care how you do it.
 I don't care if you join the big sisters and torture inner-city girls about punctuation.
 Any amount of lemon is better than the crap we're turning out lately.
 Exsqueeze me, Mr.
 D.
 Couches are ready to ship.
 In trucks.
 Ship in trucks.
 What? Wait, you sold them? To whom? I just had to find a buyer who has too much money and loves to waste it.
 So every defective sofa that Kouchtown makes will be purchased by your beloved tax-and-spend government.
 What are they going to do with them? Sink them and make a reef to protect gay turtles? I don't know, lemon, and I don't care.
 Mr.
 wang, we know you were spying for north Korean intelligence.
 Give me something I can take back to Langley.
 Then we'll get you out of the couch and send you home with a CIA gift bag.
 I totally blew off that week of Korean we did.
 Let's get the translator.
 I think maybe I still I don't think you should want to be a mom.
 Give up on having a kid.
 Okay.
 We're on the same page.
 I think we've talked about it enough.
 Maybe we just put a pin in that and have some fun.
 I'll open a puzzle.
 I'll make a stew.
 Life is happening.
 When did gum get so soft, you sons of bitches? You know what this country used to chew? Tree bark.
 Glass.
 Shotgun shells.
 The broken swords of our vanquished enemies.
 That's why I buy Bazooka Joe gum.
 It's like chewing a Mountain that someone shot a freeze ray into.
 What's wrong with this country? Huh? When did we lose our way? Detroit? Life is hard.
 Shouldn't everything else be harder? Bazooka Joe gum!   

                




                    			 Live television.
 Who cares? Who cares? Everybody.
 We love live TV.
 Do we, Lemon? Do you really love the overzealous studio audience who will applaud at anything? Here in the greatest city on earth, New York City, baby? Whassup? Wait, what are you saying, Jack? 'Cause "TGS" is live.
 Not any more.
 It's financially impractical.
 From now on, you write and shoot the whole season in two weeks like "Wheel of fortune" or FOX news.
 No.
 I mean, I grew up on live TV.
 Friday night in my parents basement.
 A telethon and cheese steaks.
 I can see it like it was yesterday.
 Best prom night ever! I'm going to lose my virginity in nine years.
 "TGS" has to be live or it will lose all the excitement and spontaneity.
 That's the beauty of live TV.
 Anything can happen.
 There's a bathroom in here you can use, sir Paul McCartney.
 See? Awesome.
 Yes.
 But my way is cheaper, and you only have to work two weeks out of the year.
 I want to go to there.
 So it's settled.
 Tonight is PGS's final live show.
 What? No, live television is an American tradition.
 You can't just throw it away! Sorry, Kenneth.
 It's a done deal.
 Our last live show? No.
  Welcome to the "30 ROCK" live show on NBC   did you know   that the 30 ROCK live show   comes live from NYC  s06 ep19 Live from studio, east coast There's a rumor spreading around here like wildfire.
 But unlike the wildfires I've started, this one doesn't sexually arouse me.
 It's true, Hazel.
 Tonight will be our last live show but don't worry.
 It won't affect you.
 Unless my plan all along was to run on stage during a sketch and get discovered by Hollywood.
 Liz.
 An important me-nouncement.
 Paul and I have decided to get married.
 Oh.
 Wow.
 And I told Paul that he should propose to me tonight on tg Absolutely not! You didn't let me finish.
 S.
 Jen, come one, it's our last live show! Exactly! And it's Jenna Maroney is getting engaged, it's going to be on live TV.
 I've been working on my reaction since I was 3.
 Aaah! It's happening, Liz.
 Miss Lemon, Mr.
 Jordan just discovered you can get pornography on the Internet.
 Oh, my gosh.
 He's going to die in there.
 What's going on? You called a meeting, Lemon.
 Actually, I called it.
 Gasp! Live television is sacred, and we are not leaving this room until the 12 of us have agreed to defend her.
 There is a great American play that was first written and performed for live television.
 It's called "12 angry men.
" No, we are not debating this like a jury.
 Shut him down, Jack.
 "12 angry men" is preposterous Kenneth.
 by Jane Fonda's father? Open the door.
 How long do you think you'll get away with this? Hazel or Jenna will know that we're missing.
 Have an amazing set tonight, everyone.
 I love you all.
 Tonight, night, Hazel.
 I do my surprise cameleo it goes viral, I take medicine for it.
 Next stop, Hollywood, Florida to get the car from my mom.
 Next stop, California, piece of kitchen.
 Tell my old boss, suck it.
 Next stop, tinseltown, because Christmas decorations are really cheap this time of year.
 Nothing brings our country together like live television.
 In studio 6h, it's a part of that tradition.
 Why it was right here that NBC broadcast the final episode of the 1950s classic "The Lovebirds.
" It's the grandpa replacement comedy hour sponsored by Kraft Singles.
 Make it with milk, is the cheese that won World War II.
 And now, "The Lovebirds.
" Starring Cubby Gilmore and Loretta Fields.
 I'm home, baby.
 And I could eat a horse.
 Don't you dare touch that bacon till it's done, Larry.
 Ooooooh.
 Ooooo-boy.
 Oh, brother, now I'm cooking a Turkey, too.
 That's rich.
 One of these days, I'm going to take a shot and blam! And blow your face off.
 It would still be better than our honeymoon.
 What was wrong with Niagara Falls? Your mother found it chilly.
 You're a real cut-up.
 In fact, one of these days I'm gonna cut you up in pieces and feed you to the neighbor's dogs.
 It will be the first time you've taken me out for dinner in years.
 Keep it up, Doris and bang, zoom, I'm going to drown you in the bathtub and say a mental patient did it.
 Like I always say Aaaaachh.
 That's a funny thing to say.
 This is real.
 Real heart attack.
 Here, eat the bacon.
 It'll lubricate your heart.
 Ride it out.
 Ride it to hell.
 Come on now, Larry.
 Don't be a sissy I'm having a heart attack, too.
 My marriage is a sham.
 My makeup lady is my lover.
 Hello.
 I'm Nazi doctor Heinrich Spaceman.
 I mean doctor.
 We can edit that out, right? Oh, it's live! Are you a modern housewife who is in the family way? Smoke Chattertons cigarettes.
 Your baby's lungs need refreshing nicotine for science reasons.
 And his growing bones need tar to hold them together.
 Nine out of ten doctors surveyed said, who is this? Why are you calling so late? But the tenth guy was into it.
  Chattertons tastes so cool and mild  a treat for you and your unborn child  Jenna, remember that package you made me take to Singapore last summer? I just got out of Changi prison.
 Thank you.
 Just portion control and exercise.
 Paul! Did you pick up the ring? Liza minnelli's baby tooth surrounded by rubies that passed through a terrified Michael Kors.
 It'll look amazing on camera.
 Look .
 I don't want to propose on TV.
 I want it to be private.
 What are you saying, Paul? Rick Santorum is right.
 Marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman.
 Which is why I'm asking you right now to make me the luckiest schman Look, I'm sorry to play the biological woman card here, but according to Roe V.
 Dwyane Wade, I have a right to choose.
 And I choose a televised proposal.
 If you can't give me that, I'm not sure what my answer will be.
 Are you giving me an ultimatum? Look, I am the man here, Jenna.
 I may have a dress and a wig and a gynecologist, but I am the man.
 Without live TV, think of the amazing moments we would have missed.
 The moon landing.
 The Beatles.
 "The voice" results show.
 That time Mr.
 Lutz was an extra and he got so nervous he threw up.
 No, don't remind him.
 Oh, I had veal.
 I had veal with cheese on it.
 And what about Joey Montero's old variety show? He was just like you, Mr.
 Jordan, because he didn't want to rehearse and he wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.
 Ladies and gentlemen, Joey Montero.
   que facciamo con questo  my love is nowhere in sight  que facciamo con questo  I ask the moon every night  We've got a great show for you tonight.
 We got a great show.
 At least that's what the Jews I pay tell me.
 I tell you, I feel great.
 I slept like a baby last night.
 I woke up crying with a boob in my mouth.
 Okay, that was the joke stuff.
 All right, here comes a lady.
 Hi, Joey, I'm Dusty Springfield.
 Sure, let's go with that.
  When I said I needed you  I need you too, baby   you said you would always stay  I can see it inside your mouth.
  It wasn't me who changed but you Oh, we are on a bounch.
  And now you've gone away  That's pretty.
  You don't have to say you love me  just be close at hand  Where's the gang going tonight fellas? **** You're invited, too, stringbean but bring the coofee for the morning, if you know what I'm saying.
 ***** Well, hello there glasess.
 Glamour.
 Excitement.
 What we today would call alcoholism.
 Live television had everything.
 Well, not everything.
 Where were the black people? Oh.
 Actually, Mr.
 Spurlock, NBC had the first two black characters on TV.
 Sort of.
 For "Alfie and Abner," NBC hired one African-American and one Caucasian because they thought two black people on the same show would make the audience nervous.
 A rule NBC still uses today.
 Abner, I'm home from work.
 Where are you, my brother? Here I is, Alfie.
 Oh, hell no.
 I am not doing this.
 NBC received a lot of complaints That the show wasn't on often enough.
 So they forced Theodore Freeman to honor his contract.
 I's done stole this catfish.
 Sir, I am asking you as a human being so please stop talking like that.
 I's gonna eat it till I'm bellyful.
 This is debasing to both of us.
 I was a tuskegee airman.
 Zip-a-Dee-goo-goo.
 You may anger me, but I believe nonviolence is the path to change.
 And I believes you can catch a rainbow in your hat.
 I'll kill you, you ignorant believe it or not, they did not stop doing the show, which made for tense but thrilling live TV.
 Banjo Kenneth.
 I've frankly lost track of what you were trying to convince us of with these detailed descriptions of television shows.
 Thank you.
 Come on.
 Times change.
 Television replaced radio.
 Cars replaced horses.
 Not where I'm from.
 Are you telling me the mayor of your hometown is a car? Pretty weird.
 Why are you laughing at me? Okay.
 Let's all take a little break.
 Hello.
 I'm Nazi doctor Leo Speceman.
 I know it's live, I want people to know.
 Did your mother smoke Chatterton cigarettes while pregnant during the 1950s or 60s? If she did, you probably can't hear me because of fetal Chatterton syndrome.
 Turn up the volume! Recent study is it show that while pregnancy is disgusting, babies do not need tar or nicotine.
 If you are currently suffering from Chatterton syndrome, please, use your Bird-like claws to dial the number below then use the rectum you have instead of a mouth to say something like "wrulgh" or "thunghth" to signify that you wish to join a class action suit against Chattertons.
  If you have scales instead of skin pick up the phone suit the Chattertons.
 All right.
 This is idiotic.
 We've got a show to do it and Oh, my God, Kenneth.
 It's my period.
 It's a-gonna blow.
 We both know you're not due for another nine days.
 And I'm ashamed of you, Ms.
 Lemon.
 Think of your hero, Rosemary Howard.
 She wrote for the edgiest live variety show of all time, "The Gruber Brother and Nipsey.
" Hey, Nipsey, what do you get when you cross a chicken with a hippie? I don't know, Dickie.
 What do you get when you cross a chicken with a hippie? I don't know, but LBJ likes them both fried.
 Lay it on me.
 Lay it on me.
 Lay it on me.
 Lay it on me.
 Now, as you know, Nipsey I'm the first streaker.
 Streaking's the new thing.
 We touched penises.
 We interrupt this program to bring you an NBC news special report.
 From Rockefeller center, Chet Huntley and David Brinkley.
 Good evening.
 NBC news has learned that less than an hour ago there was an explosion aboard the Apollo 13 spacecraft.
 David? Thank you, Chet.
 Chet? Thank you, David.
 We are awaiting further information.
 David? Thank you, Chet.
 Let's go to the manned space center in Houston and our reporter on the scene, Mr.
 Jamie Garnett.
 Jamie? Thank you, Chet and David.
 I'm sorry, sweetheart, could you move out of the way of our camera? We need to talk to our new reporter Jamie Garnett.
 Now, where is he? I'm Jamie Garnett, gentlemen.
 I spoke earlier with NASA flight director Glynn Lunney Listen, doll, you're not making any sense.
 You're probably hysterical from menstruation.
 Go lie down and make sure you get plenty of iron.
 Maybe eat a ham salad And I'm being told that commander James Lovell Honey, you have a dynamite shape, but you're going to have to shut up and let a man tell us what's happening.
 Now, is your father or a policeman nearby? Look, where did you find that microphone, sugar mouth? Was it just lying there on the ground? Where is Jamie Garnett? This just in, male NBC news reporter Jamie Garnett is missing.
 I'm right here you mother Classic live television.
 And while they never found Jamie Garnett, that woman who stole his microphone went on to become a wife.
 Has Paul not come back? He's not answering his phone.
 What have I done? Calm down.
 Paul's gone, but you're getting proposed to on the show tonight.
 By me.
 This is New York state bitch, anyone can marry anything now.
 What? But Come on.
 Everything you want, think what great TV this will be.
 It's all you want.
 No, it's not what I want.
 Paul is everything I want.
 He's the reason to get married, not TV.
 Rick Santorum was right.
 How could I have been so blind? Because you're a horrible person? Thank you.
 Just portion control and lots of water.
 All in favor of keeping "TGS" live? It's still not unanimous.
 And it never will be.
 This is a business, Kenneth, and if live TV went away, the only thing that would change would be NBC's profit margin.
 That's not true, Jackie d.
 Oh, come on, that wasn't that dramatic.
 Live TV changed my life.
 In 1986 my church dance crew performed on a regional telethon.
 It was my big break.
 Flashback.
 This is for you, Jesus.
  Ow, my coccyx! It's not funny.
 Coccyx is the scientific term for your butt bone.
 Why are you all laughing? I like it.
 Coccyx.
 Coccyx.
 You know what this is? This is the garry-o-many core.
 Oh, my God.
 I remember that.
 That was you? That's when I realized I was a ridiculous man.
 Tracy, I was there.
 As a lower-level GE employee, I was answering phones at that telethon.
 When you took off your clothes, they cut to the phone banks.
 Gasp.
 I made a hilarious prank call to that telethon.
 Did the man who answered the phone sound like he had the piercing blue eyes of an ice dragon? Yes.
 Hello, I'd like to speak to General Electric.
 Madam, I'm afraid you're confused.
 I was a nurse in the war and I met him when he was just a colonel.
 He's the father of my child.
 General Electric is not a person.
 Toby, come talk to your father.
 Daddy, it's your son, Toby electric.
 I can tell by your voice that you are a very ungainly teenage girl from southeastern Pennsylvania.
 Ah-ha, ya burnt.
 How you like me now? Young lady, no one no one jokes down General Electric.
 And if I ever Do you mind? **** if I ever get my thick, manly hands on you, I will roast you alive in an oven I design myself, using two, no, three kinds of heat.
 I'm Jack Donaghy, damn it.
 Watching you get all red-faced on TV, that was the night I found my calling Sticking it to the man.
 You know what? That night changed my life, too.
 Don Geiss saw my loyalty/handsomeness and the next day he promoted me out of poisons and into microwaves.
 Live TV made us all what we are today.
 No need to take another vote.
 "TGS" is meant to be live.
 To make it more profitable, we'll just do more sponsor product placements you should do it with the upcoming Warner Brothers movie, "Rock of ages," based on the hit Broadway musical.
 Rocking a theater near you June 15th.
 Tom Cruise sings.
 Or I'll just pay you all less.
 Kenneth, let us out of here.
 Paul didn't come.
 I ruined everything.
 Yeah, you blew it.
 So I'll just jump out at some point and lez it up with you? Okay.
 We're on in five, four, three, krang And now, "prince William and time travelling fart detectives".
 Ha, take that the man! Prince, do you smell something fishy? Who's that dude?  Zou bisou bisou   zou bisou bisou   zou bisou bisou  Jenna Maroney, you're the woman I want to grow old with.
 "Old" being an acronym for oxylaprodexatrin, a hallucinogenic plant extract that makes sex terrifying.
 I want to spend the rest of my life making you happy.
 That's why I'm asking you, on TV, to marry me.
 Oh, Paul.
 No, no, a million times no.
 Not like this.
 I don't want to get married for publicity.
 I want to get married for you.
 And so you don't testify against me in court.
 I still don't know what's going on.
 Classic live TV? I slipped.
 I slipped and hit my head in the bathroom.
 Who am I? You are my boyfriend.
 We were just going to call some poeple I went to highschool with.
 Thanks to Loren Michaels, Paul McCartney, John Hamm, Jimmy falon, Amy Pohler.
 Diane Jackson, McCarthy Miller.
 SNL crew, I love you, This happened again.
 How did that happen? Watch "Parks and Rec" tonight directed by Amy Pohler.
   

                




                    			Previously on "Queen of Jordan".
 Randy's another harvest dad, I need a nanny.
 That's perfect! All my children were taken away.
 Can you believe that D'Fwan is telling you that Angie is starting her own clothing line? Why don't you control your dog? He controls me! Hello, Angie I mean, hello, whoever it is going to be.
 Hi, Jack, it's Angie.
 I wanted to remind you we have a meeting today about my fashion line.
 Looking forward to it.
 We can do a lot of cross-promotion between our shows and your clothing Brand, uh, cheek.
 It's pronounced "chic".
 It's French.
 Now that I'm a fashion designer, I'm an octuple threat Reality star, actress, singer/song-reader, perfumist, IBS survivor, best-selling author of a book I didn't write, catchphrase coiner.
 "I'll take that with cheese.
" Well they don't all work.
 Cheek is stretchable formal wear for elegant plus-sized women and huskier gays.
 Tonight is the big fashion show for cheek's summer line.
 I find that my target customer sweats a lot and often gets thrown into a public pool.
 Now this show is the Angie, I'm sorry, but I have to take this other call.
 What? No, you don't Rude! This is Jack Donaghy.
 This is Sam Lockwood with the State Department.
 I'm stunned.
 The CIA captured a North Korean spy.
 So we were able to arrange a prisoner swap next week.
 In exchange for my wife, they get their spy back, a crate of Hollister sweatshirts and a signed headshot of Don Johnson.
 They just got Nash Bridges.
 Obviously, this is a very personal matter, so I would appreciate it if your guys at Bravo Excuse me, "gays" at Bravo Handle this with the same delicacy with which you handled D'Fwan's boyfriend's pregnancy scare.
 It's my way till pay day.
 Where is he? Jack Donaghy is late for our meeting.
 Not to be racist, but white guys are typically punctual.
 I'm sorry I got so real, but nothing's gonna change unless there's a dialogue.
 I've never been so disrespected in my life.
 And I've gone to and worked at the post office.
 Mrs.
 Jordan, Mr.
 Donaghy sends his apologies, but he is unable to attend your meeting.
 I'm here as his representative.
 No.
 That man is about to get some cheese with that.
 That catchphrase is improving, baby! You don't give me notes! Girlfriend.
 Looks like you need a girlfriend.
 I have a girlfriend.
 Her name is Raven-Symone Senior.
 I'm really close to the whole Q of cast.
 So I know they're gonna pull me into all of their drama and I'm gonna be on the show a lot.
 I will be on the show a lot.
 Where's Jack? Boob monster! I'm supposed to have a meeting with Jack Donaghy.
 Do you not know where your own husband is? I know they're not married.
 I just like them to know I don't give a about their lives.
 Jack's probably busy, Angie.
 His wife was kidnapped, but now she's coming back, and all these cameras are around, so they've been following him everywhere.
 Uhhuh.
 I see what's happening.
 Jacks' not just blowing me off.
 He's trying to ruin my big night.
 No, Angie, what's happening with him is cra No, what's happening is the cheek fashion show.
 That's what people wanna know about.
 And Tracy's planning a huge surprise for me at the end.
 Really? What is it? I don't know, Liz.
 It's a surprise.
 Do you know what a surprise is? Now you do.
 You didn't have a drink.
 Wha? Shh! Don't learn to talk.
 A woman's power comes from her silence.
 You're Liz, right? Randi.
 Great episode last week.
 I thought it was very brave of you to pose for Playboy against Playboy's wishes.
 I need a date to Angie's fashion show and Tracy tells me that you're, you know, the village bicycle.
 What? No.
 Why would he say that? Doctor guy, pilot guy, Cleveland dude, British guy, rich dude, James Franco.
 I've been with the same woman for 22 years.
 No judgments, but to me, Liz Lemon is a sex maniac.
 Well, a lady never goes anywhere without a date.
 Can someone watch Virginia? I can't.
 Contractually, I can only hold beautiful black babies in benetton ads.
 And I don't know if I should.
 'Cause I'm might bite these fat little legs.
 I might eat them up, they're so fat and juicy.
 No, Sam, the military brings her back.
 Don't even let Clinton know about this.
 He and Steve Bing will break out their sex plane.
 It is a sex plane.
 There aren't even any seats.
 It's just futons and jacuzzis.
 I've gotta run, Sam.
 Jack I God, what is this? It's just one of our shows.
 They're following me today.
 Is this one of those ridiculous reality shows like Ken Burns's jazz? Disgusting.
 I'm sorry, Diana.
 Ignore them.
 Eventually, you won't even know they're here.
 I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.
 I could use a drink.
 I'm afraid that while we're on camera, I can only offer you D'Fwan's boutique wine, "d'fwine".
 D'fwine.
 Please d'fwink responsibly.
 To Avery's return.
 I'm a part of this as well.
 I played Avery in the TV movie, Kidnapped by danger.
 Jenna, this is for family only.
 Now you sound like the cops outside of Jackie O's funeral.
 But I got in there and sang almost all of Big spender.
 I suggest you go back to whatever Florida bathroom you crawled out of.
 I can see I'm not wanted here.
 But thank you for looking up on Wikipedia that I was conceived on a toilet.
 No one wants me in their story.
 If a beautiful woman cries and no one hears it, did she waste $700 on crying lessons at Adrian Brody's unaccredited acting school? Jack, when Avery does get back, I don't think we should tell her about us.
 I want to make sure we all we're very clear about what my mother in law said in my office.
 She said we shouldn't tell Avery about Gus.
 Gus is someone I've gone into business with and Avery wouldn't approve of him.
 Why would she disapprove? Well, uh, because they dated at Yale.
 Gus was a Professor.
 Of course you'll meet him.
 We do business all the time.
 Tracy, I know you're planning a big romantic surprise for me at the end of the fashion show.
 But Jack Donaghy is messing with my special day.
 So whatever you were thinking about doing, double it.
 Call Mo'nique.
 Do a dove release.
 Parachute in and propose to me all over again, you hear? Angie, I wasn't even gonna go to your fashion show.
 It's at 8:00, which is 9:00 am Tokyo time.
 That's when Takashi's parents leave for work and we play mass effect 3 online.
 Mr.
 and Mrs.
 Tanaka think he's at school, but he's playing video games with a drunk adult.
 Now I know you're just saying that because you don't want to ruin the surprise 'cause you're a good husband.
 My God.
 Ned Stark is dead? I love my wife.
 I want her to be happy.
 But more than that, I'm gonna do nothing.
 It's hard trying to have it all.
 You wait here, Bernardo.
 She bit my.
 Eew.
 My glasses.
 It's work.
 It's work.
 But she is at such a fun age.
 You get so much out of it.
 It's fine, I'm fine.
 If everything goes according to plan, Avery will be back in a few days.
 In the meantime I have a lot of work to do With Gus, my business partner, whom Diana mentioned earlier.
 Gus, there's Gus.
 Why are you wearing the hat I asked you not to wear any more to our meetings? We're higher up here, so the sun's electricity is stronger.
 Well, uh, let's go over the numbers, Gus.
 As you can see, the numbers look pretty good.
 We're under budget and in line with projections.
 Great, well, uh, meeting over.
 You probably shouldn't have even filmed that, it was so boring.
 Diana, you remember Gus, whom you said we shouldn't tell Avery about because she used to date him.
 She was nasty.
 She loved pee.
 Thank you, Gus.
 No, Jack.
 I didn't say Gus.
 I already explained to them what I said.
 I said I did not want Avery to know about Rus.
 In slavic myth, Rus is the founder of Russia.
 Why can't Avery know about the mythological founder of Russia? Because Jack has invested a lot of money in a restaurant I'm opening called "Rus".
 It is Russian cuisine.
 Who doesn't love cold, purple soup? Diana, we're talking about the same thing, because, as you know, the restaurant Rus is the business venture I'm engaged in with Gus.
 Right, he is the chef.
 As I mentioned earlier, he's a Professor at Yale.
 Which is funny, because he looks so much more like a chef.
 What's funniest Is that's he's both.
 And now he works at the restaurant we can't tell Avery about.
 And the grand opening is tonight.
 Now he's opening up a restaurant the same night my line launches? That is a bridge too far.
 That's right.
 I read World War II history, mother-.
 Well, nobody's going to care about his restaurant when there's a fashion show going on in the middle of it.
 And a big surprise from my husband.
 Eliza Beth.
 This is very, very easy for me to say to you, but you can't come in here right now.
 Wha l just wanna drop off this little crinkly book that I got for Virginia.
 I can't let you in.
 After what happened betwixt you this morning? No, Virginia is not having you.
 What are you talking about? I might bite these fat little legs.
 They're so fat and juicy.
 Rude.
 Whit was a compliment.
 That's a thing people say to babies.
 You never talk about a black woman's leg size.
 Not on babies, not on the Williams sisters, not on a mannequin at Avenue.
 We have come too far.
 Now you know me, girl.
 I don't, really.
 I stay above these feuds.
 Did I get involved when Portia took the over-the-counter colon health test in the bathroom at Randi's domestic violence costume ball? I did, but I didn't want to.
 Can I be honest? I think I'm just anxious for Virginia to love me because I've been thinking about motherhood lately.
 I have a serious biend right now and Lisa, D'Fwan doesn't talk about people behind their backs, so I'm just gonna tell you straight to your face that what you're saying right now is very boring.
 All I know is I'm gonna stay out of this fight between you and Virginia.
 That baby is a piece of work.
 You know she should be able to stack blocks in a tower by now, but she won't do it.
 I thought you didn't talk about people behind their backs.
 Hi.
 Go away.
 Rude.
 Down.
 Down.
 Boom, right there.
 God, these flower arrangements.
 You people are savages! Just excited.
 Wait, you're putting spoons in those.
 It's just knives and forks.
 Why am I even doing this? I still have to get the menus from the printer, go to the cony island beet market.
 I've gotta pick up Yakov Smirnov at the airport.
 That's enough foil, Gus.
 Jack, it's been a year that we prayed for this restaurant opening, and I should just feel excited and relieved, but It's complicated.
 When you open a restaurant with your mother in law.
 Everyone knows you're not talking about the restaurant.
 You're talking about electricity.
 Thank you, Gus.
 There's the gang! Virginia.
 It's aunt Jenna.
 Look.
 I heard what Liz said about you, and I just have to say that I have known Liz a long, long, long time and she's totally shady.
 My God! You are hilarious.
 Do you act? Because we should do a movie together where we're on a road trip just being sluts.
 High five.
 No, I don't care that the others went to Pierre Batalini salon without me.
 It's not a feud, I just I've never spent much time with babies, okay? And what if I'm bad at it? This is good TV.
 I would watch this.
 I would feel for Liz.
 Isn't this usually a bathroom? No, Tray, it's usually Lutz's office.
 I see.
 I think I just solved the mystery of the phantom peeper.
 What's wrong, L.
L.
? You look like Angie when I tell her I wanna retire and live in an old lighthouse.
 It's just D'Fwan and everybody are saying that I'm in a fight with Virginia, which is idiotic, because she's a baby.
 Maybe it's just that children in general don't like you.
 Thank you, Tracy.
 I am dealing with something real here, but all anyone wants to do on these dumb shows is fight and scream and throw things.
 I wouldn't know.
 I really don't watch TV.
 I'm more of a masturbator.
 Well I'm about to get original on you, Tracy.
 There is no such thing as reality on reality television.
 You're happy now America? No.
 Yes.
 Welcome to Rus.
 This evening, we're serving all the Pierogis Costco had and then burger king.
 That's a sharp look, Kenneth.
 Thank you, sir, but I can't take all the credit.
 Everything I know about fashion, I learned from my old college roommate, John Mark Karr.
 Right this way.
 For God's sake.
 You've got a lot of nerve coming here.
 You know this is Virginia's night.
 You have no class, you prostitution whore.
 What are you talking about? I'm hitching my wagon to Virginia's star.
 Trying to get a little camera tiempo.
 Jenna, you've had cameras following you around all day.
 You're a star now.
 They want you on the show.
 They want me.
 Which means I'm too good for this crap.
 Like when I sang at that children's hospital.
 Get away from me, I'm revoking my waiver.
 Now blur my face.
 Blur it more.
 More.
 Now disguise my voice.
 Thank you, gays.
 Yes.
 Excuse me, do you know where the indoor outhouse is? Is my fashion show ruining Jack's party? Don't worry.
 Nobody's even noticing it.
 There's so much other stuff going on.
 And it's not just Mr.
 Donaghy and this oriental matter.
 There's the feud between Ms.
 Lemon and baby Virginia, the drama between me and that cord I tripped on.
 Watch it.
 I'm sorry, sir.
 I shouldn't have lost my temper.
 My damn husband better show up.
 Disaster.
 Deandra "I didn't know I was pregnant"-ed.
 Who's gonna wear this now? Size 12, that's what I am.
 I was my grandmother's favorite so I got all her old hand-me-downs.
 What a rush! You were horrible.
 That's the last dress.
 Tracy didn't even do anything.
 He didn't even show up.
 I'm gonna kill that man.
 What's cocaine like? What was that? Damn, you two.
 Avery's coming back from North Korea.
 Portia reads the papers.
 I hate that that's my catchphrase.
 What was that? That was nothing.
 I mean Jack's like that with everybody.
 He's a kisser.
 Right, Jack? Of course.
 It's European.
 If you don't kiss someone, they're offended.
 Very good, nice seeing you, Lemon.
 Jack, D'Fwan hasn't said "hi" yet.
 Honey, what was that? Okay, Liz, I don't know what she's talking about.
 But Virginia said she knows what you just did for Jack.
 She misjudged you, and she would like a hug.
 The feud's over.
 It's all good.
 Now I'm just looking forward to this trip.
 Because Virginia loves her little giraffe so much, the show is sending us on a girls' getaway to Somalia! I hope you're at peace with your God, Tracy Jordan.
 Because you are about to meet your maker.
 Honey, you seem upset.
 I spent the last 20 years supporting you.
 I had three of your children.
 I gave you a kidney, a kneecap and a bladder.
 But I ask you to do one thing and you can't do it.
 All I wanted was a standing ovation and for people to tweet that I was the new icon for black womanhood and then for me to tweet "why just black womanhood?" Instead, I got nothing.
 I might as well be Daphne.
 Who? I'm Daphne.
 I handle conflict appropriately, and I'm up to date on my mortgage payments.
 No, I turned what was supposed to be a boring romantic evening into a gigantic fight in front of all these cameras.
 Yes.
 How inconsiderate of you to cause all this drama and start this riveting fight.
 Our celebrity marriage is on a breakup collapse.
 We're a train wreck you cannot look away from! I can't stand the sight of you.
 My love tank is empty! Yah! Lizard egg! I want a divorce or whatever.
 It will be contentious and last all through next season.
 I'm cheating on you! Rude! Next week on Queen of Jordan I was in the neighborhood.
 I thought I'd pop up and say hello.
 For God sakes, D'Fwan, I'm working.
 Fine.
 Come here.
 You again? I am so sorry.
 Different cord.
 You were two hours late, you stole all my hangers and, yeah, I'm drunk.
 I'm on vacation.
    

                




                    			 I'm sorry, I bet your tongue it's been a while.
 I'm sorry I taste like Korean cigarettes.
 Tobacco's the only thing with protein over there.
 Their meat is just def lated kickballs.
 How are you feeling? Ready to put this all behind me.
 I don't even want to think about the things they made me do.
 Earlier today, America's credit rating was downgraded to triple fart-minus.
 You poor thing, over there all alone.
 Ahoy there.
 Jack, this is Scott Scottsman.
 Scott Scottsman.
 My ears are all plugged up from the plane.
 Am I talking too loud? Scott was forced to do sports on American news Channel USA.
 Avery Jessup with news.
 Scott Scottsman with sports.
 And it's me, Johnny Mountain, with the weather on the one and the traffic on the one.
 You no ask how I do it.
 It's a funny story, really.
 I was working for KSCT, our of Scottsdale.
 They sent me to South Korea to do a "where are they now?" On the pitcher Byung-Hyun Kim.
 Turns out he's still living in America, and I get kidnapped.
 Uhhuh.
 I had no idea there was another hostage there.
 A man.
 Right.
 Well, we should get home.
 For American news Channel USA, this is Avery Jessup.
 And I'm Scott Scottsman Reminding all of you there is no weekend.
 S06 Ep 21 The Return of Avery Jessup Good morning.
 You're up early.
 I'm putting together a knock list for the work upstairs.
 What do you think about an intercom? That way, if it's an office, you can call down.
 If it's a nursery, then you can hear the baby.
 Or the plant.
 It's your body.
 Right.
 Well, if I did ever have a plant with you or whatever I mean, at my age, we might have to get an Asian plant or accept an older plant with some behavioral issues, and we're a little afraid of it Do you want an intercom, Liz? Yes.
 Sure.
 To hear the plant.
 I'm sorry.
 It's just the more we talk about this, it's scary.
 I mean, that plant's not coming out of your butt, pal, it's coming out of mine.
 All right, well, look, to do everything, it's gonna be around ten grand.
 Duck? I'm gonna do as much work as possible, but I don't think it's safe for me to do the wiring in an old building like this.
 The walls are filled with electrocuted mice.
 Well, I could dip into my 401K Is something I've heard old people say in commercials.
 Well, I could chip in.
 If you take my prof its from the hot dog truck and add 'em to the $300 my aunt gave me for Christmas, I'd have $200.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Let me think about it, but I've got to get to work.
 Boy, I sound just like my dad.
 Which, I guess, makes me Mrs.
 Lemon.
 Seriously, though, I gotta get to work.
 I gotta get to yoga and lunch with the girls.
 Tracy, who sponsored your wedding? I don't know.
 There was a lot of fanta there, and the police, so maybe they co-sponsored it? That's right, you were a nobody when you got married.
 Only huge stars get to have their wedding sponsored.
 Ms.
 Maroney, a wedding is a simple and beautiful ceremony where an old man and a crying girl get pushed into the coupling shed.
 No, if you don't have a sponsor these days, you're nobody.
 My sponsor is the Southern Tourism Bureau.
 It's perfect 'cause I'm sort of a down-home, America's sweetheart type.
 Leonardi, my hair psychic, is always saying how down to Earth I am.
 I know the Southern tourism bureau.
 They pay me a yearly stipend to stay in New York.
 They're paying for me and Paul to get married on an old plantation.
 Which is great 'cause our wedding was gonna be slavery-themed anyway.
 All I have to do is shoot a commercial and say, "Dixie is calling, you all.
 I reckon you should answer.
" Are you sure you're saying that right? Of course I .
 I have a natural Southern accent, 'cause I'm from le flori-dah pahn-hahndle.
 You know, a lot of people lose their accents once they leave home and go off to the big city.
 Before moving here, I done used to talk-n-jaw like this, see? And when I'm at work, I use my white-people voice.
 You should see how we talk in the Bronx.
 Raar blarg shmoo-boo wagga! I'm sorry, sir, I have no idea what you're saying.
 I'm sure it's nothing that I can't fix with a little accent work.
 I'm not gonna let it ruin my dream wedding.
 It's only a dream wedding? Thank God! I did not want to attend.
 All set, Jack.
 Did Liddy go down? Eventually.
 Understandably, she's a little wary of me.
 I heard her ask her bear who the dye job is.
 Don't worry about it.
 You're home now, we're Jack and Avery, and we are going to crush this return to normalcy.
 Absolutely.
 It's gonna be like I was never away.
 Absolutely.
 Frankly, not too much has changed.
 There is an iPod 3 and a Mitt Romney 4.
 They worked all the bugs out.
 He's not killing hobos at night any more.
 And tomorrow, I am going to throw you a Thanks-Christmas-Valen-Easter-Ween of July party.
 Genius.
 We'll celebrate all the holidays I missed in one night.
 We are gonna be so normal so fast! I've already started my job search.
 I'm making a new reel.
 I actually did some good work over there.
 Scott and I co-reported on the North Koreans sweeping the Olympics.
 They did, right? Yes Scott.
 I'm so glad there was someone there for you during this, uh, ordeal.
 Look, Jack, I know we can put everything back the way it was.
 There's just one thing I need to say first.
 I didn't wear your nightgowns.
 If they seem stretched out, it's because you're remembering wrong.
 No, Jack, what I want to say is If anything happened while I was gone between you and someone else It doesn't matter now.
 Okay? All is forgiven.
 Okay, Jenna, I need some relationship advice.
 Well, you've come to the right place.
 I've been writing a sex column for Cosmo.
 Cosmo is my 14-year-old neighbor.
 He doesn't know anything.
 No, it's not about sex.
 It's about money.
 Liz! Sex, money, power, fire, choking, being dragged behind a speed boat It's all the same thing.
 Look, you and I are both in situations where we're the breadwinner.
 How do you and Paul deal with that? We love it.
 Gender role-reversal is such a turn-on.
 Paul keeps the house nice, and I try to get him pregnant.
 And the best part is, if I want to treat myself to a new pair of Christy LaButtons, I don't have to ask any man for $17.
 I'm sorry, Christy who? LaButtons.
 They're knockoff Christian Louboutins.
 I got tired of ruining $1,200 shoes trying to impregnate my boyfriend.
 You know something, against all odds, you have a point.
 Feminism promised us two things Fatter dolls, and an end to traditional gender roles.
 Why am I fighting this? So what if I make more money than Criss? Exactly.
 It doesn't bother me.
 Doesn't bother Oprah.
 It sure doesn't seem to bother Criss.
 He's at yoga right now.
 You wear the pants, Liz.
 You don't necessarily pull them off because of your hips, but you wear them.
 So embrace it! Lemon, Avery's missed the past 12 months of popular culture.
 Could you put together a presentation for tomorrow? An hour, tops.
 An hour for the year? Am I supposed to just scratch the surface of channing Tatum's meteoric rise? Lemon, Avery did something strange this morning.
 They brainwashed her, didn't they? Avery said something this morning Something shocking.
 That no matter what happened while she was gone, "all is forgiven.
" And that's bad? It seems awfully nice of her, considering.
 Exactly.
 Awfully nice.
 Does that sound like Avery to you? Well, no.
 That woman does not forgive.
 She's still furious with Al Gore for stealing George Bush's idea to have an Internet.
 And now she's forgiving me? Why? Because she wants to change the conversation because she's done something she doesn't want to talk about.
 And what do people not want to talk about? Soccer, jazz, infidelity.
 Okay, first of all, I don't know what you count as cheating, but she was forced to marry someone else.
 Kim Jong-Un, Lemon.
 Have you seen news footage of that man? I have so many missile! I even have nuclear missile.
 Just for you, sugarprong.
 There was another American there, Lemon.
 A man.
 It raises some red flags.
 My God.
 Who are you to talk? You French-Canadian kissed her mother, which is my name for French kissing when it bums everybody else out.
 Yes.
 Brilliant.
 I'll use my indiscretion to guilt her into revealing hers.
 The game is afoot! No.
 She's been back for, like six hours.
 Maybe take a little time, let things get back to normal.
 Playing psycho-sexual mind games is our normal, Lemon.
 This is perfect.
 Everything's perfect.
 Dadgum possum up and what been bit my mother's neck brace.
 Dadgum possum up and what been bit my mother's neck brace.
 Again! Dadgum possum up and what been my mom's neck brace.
 Again, you waste of my time! Dadgum possum up'n what bit my mama's neck brace! There it is.
 Again! Excellent.
 Again! Dixie's callin', y'all.
 I reckon you should answer.
 No, this isn't right.
 This isn't Southern elegance.
 This is a dirtbag girl I once knew.
 A girl named Jay-nuh! She used to get into fistfights at water parks, and lost her virginity to a bait salesman on a water bed.
 She's not who I am any more.
 I'm classy.
 People who say that about themselves usually are.
 This whole Southern thing is wrong.
 I need to find a new wedding sponsor that's as classy as I am.
 I'm not this person, 'cause I done got rid of her! Kim Jong-Il could not be reached for comment because he was having a totally normal day being alive and not dead.
 And now with sports, Scott Scottsman.
 Thanks, Avery.
 In NBA action, Kim Jong-Un won the championship today.
 Our brilliant comrade scored 200 points and then went hot-tubbing with a couple guys he's definitely just friends with.
 Hi.
 Look, I've been thinking about what you said earlier about forgiveness It was beautiful.
 But I would feel very guilty if I kept anything from you, as I know you would if you kept something from me.
 So while you were away, I did have feelings for another woman.
 Thank you.
 I forgive you.
 You lose, Jack Is what Kim Jong-Il said to Jack Nicklaus after def eating him in golf today because they're both totally alive.
 You went out and bought a Fedora.
 This? I finally watched the premiere of Prime suspect on Hulu.
 It's really very good.
 Anyway, I thought I would treat myself.
 But don't worry, I'm gonna take care of you too.
 Okay, but look, I still want to chip in on this renovation.
 And clean out your life savings? Why don't you take that $200 and buy yourself something cute? Here's a hint.
 I like zippers.
 I'm a man.
 I'm a man, I'm a man! I'm an adult man! You think I like you having to pay for everything? It's humiliating.
 But gender roles, fat dolls You think I like having to earn crisspoints so that I can take you on dates that you actually pay for? I thought you liked the crisspoints system.
 Only because liking the crisspoints system is one of the ways I earn crisspoints! Okay, I'm sorry that I offended your male pride, but you're the one who chose to sell hot dogs out of a car.
 It is a van with a car engine, Liz, okay? Now, look, if your show gets canceled, okay, or NBC just becomes a web site that sells used office supplies, I'd like to know that I can take care of you.
 And now we're talking about having a plant? It's stressing me out! Really? It's stressing you out? Of course, because you're the person who has to krang that plant for nine months, poop it, and then go back to work to support both of you! Uhhuh.
 So what you're saying is you need somebody different to do this with.
 Somebody with money that's probably named Spencer or Grant.
 And he has a watch, and an office with a trash can and a little basketball hoop on it.
 And he plays as hard as he works because, damn it, he deserves to blow off a little steam.
 God, I don't wanna be with Spencer! And yet you're silent about Grant.
 Well, guess what I'm gonna become Grant.
 That's right, tomorrow I'm gonna take my truck out, and I'm gonna start pulling my weight, like a man.
 Now, get in that bed, and let's watch Dance moms.
 Girl.
 Are you crying because there are no roles for actresses in their 40s, nor should there be? I thought I found a classy new sponsor for my wedding, but then something happened.
 Hubbard's flavorless english water biscuits I'm sorry.
 Hubbard's flavorless english water biscuits Cut! They fired me.
 We did 50 takes, and I couldn't do it.
 I once did 100 takes and still couldn't say the word "incorrigible.
" Great, now I get it! Siri, bring Jessica Tandy back to life.
 I thought that girl from toilet swamp cove was dead and buried, but she's always been there inside me, and now she's taking over.
 I want to throw a natty light at a cop car! I have someone inside me too.
 It's a bath toy of a scuba diver.
 I need to take a walk and clear my head Tracy Jessica Tandy's zombie is coming to find you.
 Is that correct? Yes, siri.
 Thank you, baby.
 So, Lemon, I took your advice and used my transgression with Diana, as a weapon to interrogate Avery, just as you suggested.
 That is not what I suggested.
 You just hear what you want to hear.
 Thank you.
 They're from Italy.
 I just gave Avery a little taste.
 Said I was attracted to another woman.
 Guess what she told me.
 Nothing.
 She just forgave me.
 Believe me, I didn't expect her to come out of her forgiveness bunker so easily, but I really need to up the ante.
 Drop a grenade in that bunker, like Jim Brown in The Dirty Dozen.
 Enjoy your party, Nazis! Are you talking about your wife? God, she's good.
 This kind of gamesmanship is why I love her.
 She has the brain of a man, and the ass of a French teenager.
 But I will win.
 I don't know, Jack, it's 2012.
 It's not always clear who wears the pants in the family.
 I do, Lemon.
 I wear the pants.
 Good morning.
 Good morning.
 Nice pants, Avery.
 And, Liz, good to see you.
 You're hair's the same.
 It's not.
 Actually, something terrible happened.
 I don't have a lot of time.
 I have my year-in-finance presentation after this, and Lloyd Blankfein slithers back into the sewers to eat rotten fish at 6:00, so [Rapping] Deathly hallows and tebow   Oprah does her last show   Beyonce had a baby, yo   It's a 12-month wrap-up, rap-rap-rap-up  You know what, I'll just read some US weeklies.
 Thank you, Lemon.
 But it's an hour long, like you wanted.
 Thank you.
 Fine.
 I'm gonna head down to Goldman early.
 Avery, I should tell you something.
 I wasn't completely honest when I was being completely honest earlier.
 Let me stop you right there.
 I forgave you so that we wouldn't have to discuss this.
 Let me stop you right there from stopping me right there.
 I know why you forgave me.
 But the woman I mentioned, we kissed.
 And I know I would hate it if you kept something like that from me, so So I forgive you.
 And no matter what you say, I am always going to forgive you.
 Always.
 Aha! What do you think? Pretty awesome, It's a brand new location, Liz.
 I got a subway entrance right here, and I got a tour bus stop right there.
 Also, FOX News is right across the street, and word is Greta Van Susteren eats hot dogs like slimer.
 Yeah, who's usually here? Right, those creepy, off-brand sesame street characters that harass tourists into paying them to take pictures with them.
 I hate those guys.
 As a sesame street purist, I don't think Elmo usually tells passing women the they have a sweet dumper.
 Move it! This is our corner, pal! You don't own this corner.
 And I got a family to support, like a man.
 Don't hit my cheekbones! Stop it! Get off him, Elmo! Legally, I have to say I'm Elmarg! Them puppets done picked the wrong day to cross my kin! It's on, panhandle style! Well, it's over.
 I'm never gonna get a wedding sponsor now.
 That dirtbag Jay-nuh won.
 I wanted my wedding to be an expression of who I am, and now it will be.
 I'm a panhandle hick, and my wedding will be just another panel on my mother's family history back tattoo.
 Come on, it's not all that bad.
 Look at that caption.
 "Aging star Jenna Maroney, beats up Elmo with her" So you own things.
 That's good.
 "Christian" That's always a good word.
 Wait, did they say "Christian" about my shoes? "With her Christian Louboutins.
" They didn't know that my shoes were cheap knockoffs.
 They thought they were fancy, even though they're secretly crap.
 That's it.
 That's who I am! I'm that knockoff designer shoe.
 My outside is shiny and pretty, but my inside is filled with cardboard and horse glue.
 I've solved my identity crisis! More importantly, I know who can sponsor my wedding! No, I think it's a very cool costume, mayor Bloomberg.
 Tonight, I'm mayor Booo-mberg.
 Yes, I think you've mentioned that.
 Booo booo Scott.
 Happy birthdaversary, honey.
 Jack, this homecoming's been amazing.
 Nice to see you relaxing and enjoying yourself, and totally unprepared for a forgiveness attack.
 What? Avery What? The woman I kissed is your mother.
 That is shocking.
 But I told you all is forgiven, so all is forgiven.
 What do I have to say to guilt the truth out of you? How about this? A few months ago, Liddy broke into the gun safe and shot up your gift-wrapping room.
 I did wear your nightgowns.
 Not to feel you near, they're just comfortable.
 I had an erotic dream about an adult Dora the explorer.
 I took her on a balcony in Madrid, above the Plaza Mayor.
 She had flowers in her hair.
 Now I've admitted everything.
 Game over, Avery.
 Tell me what you did.
 I'll tell you exactly what I did, Jack.
 I won.
 You what? I got you to tell me everything you did.
 And guess what I didn't do anything.
 But Scott Scottsman Until the flight home, the only words I'd ever said to Scott Scottsman were, "and now with sports, Scott Scottsman.
" I thought I was playing you, and you were playing me the whole time.
 And in 24 hours, I got you to tell me things it would have taken you years to admit.
 Now we can start over.
 The final piece of the puzzle is just me forgiving you for, kissing my mother! We did it.
 Everything's normal.
 USA! It's classic us.
 Damn it, Jessup, I'd marry you all over again! That's what we're gonna do.
 We've gonna renew our vows.
 We need a new blender anyway.
 Baby.
 Sorry I'm late.
 Criss got into a fight with an Elmo.
 And he hates it that I make more money than he does.
 And I don't know, maybe we're not supposed to have a plant together.
 Love is complicated, right? Wrong.
 We kicked love's ass! Yes! We're renewing our vows.
 No, no, renewing vows is a kiss of death.
 You should have let me finish my rap.
 There was a whole verse about it!  J-Lo and Marc Anthony   Donn and Vicki from O.
 C.
   12-month wrap-up, rap-rap-rap-up  Lemon.
 It's the kiss of death, yo! I reject Chris Brown's comeback! Lemon out! Here at off-brandheelz.

                    			You didn't whisper in my ear and kiss me to wake me up like you always do.
 I've never done that.
 Sweetie, wake up.
 It's morning.
 I love you too.
 Anyway, I'm taking the van out to Queens.
 There's this big parade.
 Parades need people.
 People need hot dogs.
 That's where Van Der Beek and I step in.
 You named your van after the guy from Dawson's Creek? I've seen everything he's ever been in except for that.
 Please just let me pay for the renovation.
 No.
 Or we could just hold off.
 We don't need a nursery now.
 And who knows if we'll ever even have a Plant or whatever? See, you're already backing off of this whole thing because you don't think I'm the guy to do it with.
 You're gonna bail on me.
 I don't bail.
 I am still watching Smash, Criss.
 Well, I'm not gonna be the reason why you put anything on hold.
 I'm getting that money.
 Good morning! Girl talk time.
 Fine, I'll go first.
 Since I had to move out of Razmig's place, my living situation's been a little in flux, and obviously I can't go to a homeless shelter.
 I mean, the people there can be a little sexually conservative for my tastes.
 So I was thinking Maybe I could crash with you for a year or so? Okay.
 Look, Hazel.
 I'm sorry, but no.
 You and I do need to have some boundaries.
 Poor baby.
 Can't hack it in the big city? Gonna move to the bay area now, pretend that that was your dream the whole time? Have fun always carrying a light sweater.
 Is this about when I tried to cripple you? Jenna, that was weeks ago.
 Bye, Hazel.
 I look forward to reading your obituary, "Least famous person in the world dies.
" Lemon, didn't you get ordained online and perform a lesbian wedding last summer? Yes, I married Becky and Dee because love is love and there's no reason they shouldn't experience the joy of marriage like any other couple.
 I'm not going to the container store.
 This is my Saturday.
 Congratulations.
 You just turned into your father.
 Avery and I want to renew our vows tomorrow afternoon and we need and officiant.
 Jack, no way.
 Wanting to renew your vows is a sign that there are deeper problems.
 You kissed Avery's mom.
 Which they both know about.
 And they're fine with it.
 They're fine with it? What Bill O'Reilly erotic novel are you living in? I suppose our situation is most reminiscent of "The Commodore's lust" from the "Patriot's after dark" series.
 Okay, fine.
 But if I'm doing this for you, guess what, buddy.
 I get your Yankees tickets on a-Rod bobblehead day.
 And I'm gonna throw that thing in front of a train.
 Go Phillies! Thank you, Lemon.
 Skinny arm-havers! Diana! What a wonderful surprise.
 I did not know you were coming up for this.
 And why wouldn't I, Liz? Although, a vow renewal is a little tacky, so I'd rather they weren't doing it.
 Really? That's the reason you wish we weren't doing it.
 There's other reason, right, mother? Stop, drop, and roll! Let me out! Let me out! S06Ep22 What Will Happen to the Gang Next Year Well, Tracy, I hope you're proud of yourself.
 You were named "man of the year" By the "Journal of the Aryan patriot party.
" Did they say when the banquet is? Because I'm kind of between tuxes due to weight fluctuation.
 Tray, this is not good.
 You are a representative of the black community.
 You're supposed to be making us look better, not worse.
 I do! For instance, in Pixar's upcoming movie about trash, I'm doing the voice of a lazy bottle of grape-flavored soda named Funky Bobo.
 Okay, I hear it! Scott and I saw each other every day at work, but we're forbidden from speaking.
 I was living in an exact replica of Cinderella's castle that Kim Jong-Un had built for his shoe collection.
 And I was kept in a pit where they made me beat my best friend to death.
 Awkward.
 What an ordeal.
 And I know a little bit about suffering because I work out A lot! I think we have a clip.
 Kim Jong-Un's fifth Miss Universe title in four years.
 And now with sports, Scott Scottsman.
 Thank you, Avery.
 Now for today's highlights.
 Kim And now with sports, Scott Scottsman.
 Thank you, Avery.
 And now for highlights.
 Kim Jong And now with sports, Scott Scottsman.
 Thank you Avery.
 And now with today's sports Highlights.
 It's a code! I'm sorry.
 I was gonna come in here and cry 'cause I didn't get back into the page program.
 But instead I'm being brave.
 Stop whining.
 I don't have a place to live, Kenneth.
 I'll have to go back upstate to that cult.
 God, I had so many husbands.
 You really don't have a place to live? Well, where will you sit patiently in the dark while you wait for the next day to start? I mean, sleep? Miss Wassername, you can stay with me.
 I remember how tough it was when I first moved to New York.
 I still wouldn't be able to afford rent if I didn't have a roommate.
 Have a good day, Doris.
 "You have a good day too, Kenneth.
" Whatever, Doris.
 Grow up.
 Well, if you really mean it I don't mean it, I nice it.
 You're staying with me, Hazel.
 So How was your day? What are you doing? Answering your question, dear.
 My day was revealing.
 Jack, I can explain.
 You love wet feet? Okay, maybe I haven't mastered your code, but I'm trying to say you lied to me.
 You said you didn't do anything with Scott.
 Is this nothing? "I miss you at night.
 I think about you all the time.
 "I couldn't get through this without you.
 Check out Kim Jong-Un's pants.
 Where's the flood?" How could you do this to me? Scott and I have never touched, Jack.
 Unlike you and my mother.
 I thought you forgave me for that.
 Of course, darling.
 Now maybe you can forgive me for developing feelings for the only other person in the world who knew what I was going through! All right, we obviously have some problems to sort out, but we're going to get through this.
 We're Jack and Avery.
 That's right.
 We're not quitters.
 See? I'm not even angry anymore! Nor am I! Do you wanna watch Downton Abbey tonight? I'd love to! Maggie Smith is a treasure! My soil's pretty good so I will plant this seed My back's still strong enough to pull some weeds I can kick out all these stones And I can shoo these birds away Growing together every day [Crash] We find a little sunny spot With mornings full of dew And I will tell the garden club How proud I am of you Growing together it's just botany Growing together Planty and me I know.
 I'm sorry.
 I didn't Yeah? Hi, I was thinking about you.
 How's the parade going? Tough crowd.
 I had no idea the shmuley Israel memorial parade was a predominantly Jewish event.
 Criss, you don't have to do this.
 I am not gonna give up on you.
 You know what kind of women in their 40s have never been married, Liz? Uggos, crazies, and bailers.
 You're not an uggo.
 And you're "ha-ha" crazy, not "oh, boy" crazy, which means you bail.
 So I'm not gonna give you an excuse to quit.
 I don't care what it takes, I'm getting that money.
 Planty, no! I don't care about that.
 Okay, who am I? Who am I? Doris! Wonderful.
 See you tonight, roomie.
 Yes, you will.
 Hazel.
 What? A moment, please.
 Let's cut through the crap, Hazel.
 I know how you think.
 You lie, you cheat.
 You manipulate to get what you want.
 I'd admire you if you weren't brunette.
 I'm a natural blonde.
 That's insane! Look, I don't know what your angle is with Kenneth, but you leave him out of this.
 I don't have any angle with Kenneth, Jenna.
 I've already taken care of him.
 What's that supposed to mean? Nothing.
 Stop looking at my ass.
 Stop pointing your ass at my eyeballs.
 It's an honor to finally meet you, Questlove.
 Tracy, this is Dr.
 Cornel West.
 He teaches African-American studies at Princeton.
 Yeah, brother Walter and brother Warren and I were out seen in The Five-year engagement last night, and they mentioned your concerns about the image you're presenting as a black man.
 Look, I don't wanna make us look bad, but these dumb white writers don't know how us soul cats speak, one 'twixt the other.
 And they keep backing up this truck full of money for me to do this crap.
 I don't know what to do.
 Before you change the system, you've got to change yourself, brother Jordan.
 Who were your black role models growing up? Darth Vader, ninjas, some black licorice I tried to make into the shape of my dad.
 That's the challenge there.
 How are you gonna be a black role model when you've never had one? I've been blessed to have mom and dad and my brother Cliff, John Coltrane, Curtis Mayfield, and as of last night, brother Jason Segel.
 So I just need to find my own role model to inspire me.
 But where should I look? Might be closer than you think.
 Maybe right under your own nose.
 Under my own nose.
 Like a mustache.
 A mustache.
 Tom Selleck! You've got to go to a civil rights museum.
 I'm praying for my brother.
 Excuse me.
 Diana! The ceremony's not for a little while.
 You might wanna pace yourself.
 Are you gonna do the part where you say, "speak now or forever hold your peace"? I was gonna.
 Why? This is gonna be a mess! Diana.
 Excuse me, are you Elizabeth Lemon? During the ceremony, are you gonna do the whole "speak now or forever hold your peace" part? Wait, what? Why? Who are you? I'm Scott.
 I was in Korea with Avery.
 We used to tap messages to each other during the news.
 One day we made love while tapping.
 It was beautiful.
 No butt stuff.
 No, no, no.
 Scott, you don't wanna break up a marriage.
 I'm not married.
 Before I got kidnapped, Teresa and I were engaged to be engaged.
 No, Jack and Diana Avery! Avery and Diana Damn it! Jack and Nancy.
 No, do not do anything.
 Excuse me, lady.
 You do the vow? You know, "speak now or forever hold your peace" part? My God.
 Are you No! I'm nobody! Kim Jong-Il is dead.
 I'm only waiter.
 I'm greatest waiter of all time.
 Okay.
 Boy.
 Guys! Quick question about the vows.
 The whole "speak now or forever hold your peace" part All things considered, it kinda feels like it's just Asking for trouble.
 Liz, do the vows as written.
 Yes, this relationship has been tested.
 And yet here we are.
 To quote George W.
 Bush, Lemon, "bring 'em on.
" He said that to me in Galveston when a busload of drunk debutantes tried to get on his boat.
 It was named "Mr.
 water boat.
" Did it sink? Yes.
 Because there were too many people on it.
 But the spirit of his words lives on.
 Okay, but are you sure I appreciate your concern, Lemon.
 But Avery and I don't quit.
 Ever.
 Hello, Kenneth.
 How are things with your new roommate? Are you talking about Hazel or the raccoon that won't let me into my kitchen? Either way, the answer is "wonderful.
" I'm talking about Hazel.
 I know how she thinks, Kenneth.
 So I went down to human resources, turned on the old charm, and got a copy of the application you submitted to the page program.
 This isn't my application.
 This isn't even my handwriting.
 Do you know whose handwriting it is? Hazel's.
 She sabotaged you so you won't become a threat.
 And to think I thought Hazel was a bitch! Friendly and loyal like a well-trained female dog.
 But she isn't a bitch.
 She's a meaniepants.
 This is gonna be a mess.
 Police are reporting that a bank on Jackson Avenue was robbed this afternoon by a lone suspect A white male in his 30s.
 Security cameras caught the getaway van heading West towards Manhattan.
 Nerf herder! Nerf-herder! Come on, Tray.
 Are you telling me you haven't found one person in here who inspires you? What about Frederick Douglass? A guy with two first names? Next.
 That dress belonged to Rosa Parks.
 She's one of my personal heroes.
 I think I found my role model.
 Good choice.
 Sister Parks once said each person must live their life as a model for others Shut up, Dotcom.
 I'm not talking about her.
 I'm talking about me looking funny in this reflection.
 I'm gonna do a movie where I play someone's fat old aunt and I say stuff like, "-wee!" And "sweet child, sit yo' black ass down!" No, Tray, that's exactly what we're trying to avoid.
 Questlove asked me to find a role model.
 I did.
 It's Tyler Perry.
 From now on, my movies will be produced, written, directed, and seen exclusively by African-Americans.
 That's right.
 I'm starting my own studio.
 Beautiful! You can't go to prison, you idiot.
 They will ravage you and your beautiful woman face.
 I'll say I did it.
 I can handle prison.
 I have a mean face and I can will myself to sleep in any environment.
 Wait, what are you talking about? The heist.
 They saw your van.
 Why didn't you take out the cameras and kill all the witnesses, you beautiful bastard? I didn't Rob a bank, Liz.
 God! No, I sold the van this morning To a really nice young guy on Meth.
 You sold Van Der Beek? For me? I sold Van Der Beek For us.
 I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over.
 And now I can pay to redo the upstairs.
 And I was gonna go to prison for you.
 Even when I thought you had robbed a bank, I wasn't gonna bail.
 I won't bail on you! You won't bail on me.
 You won't bail on me.
 Have you ever had a girlfriend willing to Thelma and Louise with you? No.
 Never.
 But come on, Bonnie and Clyde.
 Okay, I'm a boy.
 I'm a boy, Liz.
 Also, I hear Pippa Middleton couldn't come today because Avery was borrowing her ass.
 If anyone can show just cause why Jack and Avery may not be lawfully joined together, speak now or forever hold your peace.
 Teresa.
 I just want alereeb to be happy.
 Kim Where are you going? You're the best waiter I've ever seen.
 I know, Mr.
 Stepanian.
 I know.
 Great! So no one.
 Are you people kidding me? Seriously, no one has anything to say? You're all cowards.
 He kissed my mother.
 And she's in love with Scott.
 How can you stay silent when there's so much to object to? What kind of friends are you? I have something to say.
 I played Avery Jessup in "Kidnapped by danger," now available on Sega Genesis.
 Thank you! I forgot about the TV movie that whitewashed our love story.
 I was dating another woman.
 And I wasn't ready to get married.
 We only did it because She was pregnant.
 I was pregnant.
 You truly are an amazing woman, Avery.
 The only thing you're bad at is quitting.
 I kept my sea monkeys alive for 30 years.
 We're both incapable of failure, so deep down we were hoping someone else would ruin it for us.
 I mean, if we wanted this thing to succeed, why would we ask Liz to officiate? Because I'm good at blending humor and heart? I'll always care for you.
 We'll split assets in custody equally.
 I'll take our friends "A" through "L.
" You'll get "M" through "Z".
 Liz, divorce us.
 By the power vested in me by the website instaminister.
Estonia, I now pronounce you divorced.
 Yeah! Divorce! I thought you were my friend.
 But you were trying to destroy me the whole time.
 It started that way.
 But then I fell in love with you.
 All you've done is lie to me.
 How can I believe you now? Believe this.
 Don't you ever do that again.
 This would make a great room for a baby.
 You said, "baby," instead of "plant.
" Now say, "man cave.
" Never! Didn't expect to see you tonight.
 In all the commotion, I forgot to give you this little Thank you for officiating our event.
 It's the remote control holder you wanted from Skymall.
 Yes! Yes! Awesome! Criss is doing a little renovating upstairs Because we are thinking about having a baby Together That will emerge from my vagina.
 Or a Chinese vagina.
 Okay.
 I'll see you at work tomorrow.
 Wait, that's it? You're not gonna give me any advice? I can't, Lemon.
 I don't have any right to.
 I've been, uh Divorced twice.
 Engaged two other times.
 I'm a mess.
 But any child would be lucky to have you be the mother it loves then hates for a few years, then loves again, then half-heartedly defends to its spouse, then puts in a home.
 You don't need my advice.
 But I still want it.
 If you decide to have child, you going to make an excellent mother As long as you follow Jack Donaghy's Number one, don't overthink the names.
 Stick to Kings and Queens of England.
 There will never be a president Ashton or a Dr.
 Katniss.
 Or a non-sexually confused Lorne.
 Number two We had a good time tonight.
 I wonder what will happen to the gang next season.
 Will Liz have a baby? Will Jack become supreme leader of Kabletown? Will Kenneth No, I don't care! All I want is Jack and Liz get together.
 On Friends, it was so satisfying.
 They do on Cheers, they do on Moonlighting.
 Everybody do it! Don't overthink it, writers.
 Whoever you are.
   

                




                    			After all these years, I finally have it all.
 I'm gonna miss this place.
 That's how you do it.
 It's two lines.
 Hey, 1% d-bag! You can't park here! You don't own the sidewalk! It's nice to see you back at work and taking advantage of being in the greatest city on Earth, despite our tiny and American sodas.
 Well, I feel like New York City is one of the characters on our show.
 That's idiotic.
 So how was your hiatus? Start with what puzzles you did.
 Venice, solar system, unicorn The cast of L.
 A.
 Law.
 That one took me a while.
 So much white.
 Anyway Good to be back, but stressful.
 The usual Liz Lemon work-life balancing act.
 How are things with Chris? Good.
 Great.
 We are trying Really, Lemon? You can't even say "trying"? What positions are you using? The one.
 There's only one.
 Talk about something else.
 Fine.
 We'll talk about me.
 I have never been better.
 And my divorce went smoothly.
 In fact, thanks to a round of golf with Archbishop Dolan, I was never married.
 Libby won a bronze in horsey jumpy at the baby Olympics, and at work, I am taking the bull by the horns.
 Have you seen the new fall shows? Yes, I have Seen them.
 If you're tired of sexy vampires, then you'll love Hunchbacks, starring Jonathan Silverman as Dr.
 Fantastico.
 And do you like the information channel you get when you stay in a hotel? Well, Thursdays is just that now.
 So what do you think of the new shows? I hey, Jonathan's back.
 Yes, little big man discovered the grass isn't always greener on the other side, and came crawling back.
 My grandmother was seriously ill.
 I went to salinas to feed and bathe her.
 I'm sorry.
 I still don't like you.
 God cop? "Crime just got a new worst friend.
" The hell is that? A show I am very excited about.
 A New York City detective solves crimes with the help of his new partner, God.
 So God just tells him who did it? God can't just tell him who did it.
 Why not? Watch the pilot, Lemon.
 It's all explained in the end by the wise black man played by Karl Malone.
 You're really taking some swings here.
 I have no choice.
 My boss Hank Hooper is clearly planning to retire.
 Word is he bought a boat.
 But it's not a yacht, for corporate parties and Hooker disposal.
 It's a two-man fishing boat.
 I believe that is called a skiff.
 I will not have you telling me boat names in my own office.
 Hank has vowed to keep Kabletown in his family.
 I have one chance to change his mind before he retires.
 That's where shows like God cop, O.
J.
 Simpson live, and Rule of threes come in.
 Brother.
 Brother A comedy about two jive-talking con men hiding out in a monastery.
 Jonathan, bring me my green light.
 S07 Ep01 The beggining of the end  My wedding is gonna be a disaster! The doves I ordered for the wedding came, and they're all dead! One of 'em touched my tongue! Calm down.
 I'll show you that video of Taylor Swift getting hit in the face with a foul ball.
 I'm fine, Liz.
 The doves were just a drill.
 Everyone needs to be on their toes for my wedding year.
 I'm gonna be a nightmare.
 Wait, if that was a drill, did you kill those doves? No.
 I bought them at the dead dove store.
 Grow up, Liz.
 Jenna, you're always a High-strung perfectionist.
 I prefer soul-sucking monster.
 How could your wedding make you any worse? I don't know, but it's a fun little journey we're all gonna go on together.
 So when is this wedding? I can't tell you.
 It's a secret surprise wedding.
 Because that's what all the big celebrities do.
 Beyonce, J.
Lo, Natalie Portman, whose real last name is Hershlag, by the way.
 Okay, that's not relevant.
 I just think people should know.
 You know, I have a lot of really good friends I could ask to be my maid of honor.
 Paz de la huerta, the former Mrs.
 Jon Cryer, honey boo boo's mom.
 June.
 But you're my oldest friend.
 And also, I've known you for a long time.
 Liz, will you be my maid of honor? Jenna, that is so nice.
 But I've just got so much going on with the show and baby stuff.
 God! My hands! Please! I'll do it! I'd love to do it! You're my best friend! Yay! You're in charge of the bachelorette party.
 Make sure you have a stripper there from every race.
 Start looking for Indian now.
 It's a tough booking.
 Mm, best friendies! Mr.
 Jordan.
 I need some advice.
 I recommend you get it from Liz Lemon or an owl who wears glasses.
 No, sir.
 It's about women.
 I've been living with Hazel for the past few months, and while we have gotten to second base You mean a threesome with Robinson Cano? No.
 I mean sharing a yogurt.
 I'm saving myself for marriage, and Hazel says she's saving herself for a grade-a pork machine.
 And those are expensive.
 It's just Hazel's my first real girlfriend, and I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to make her happy.
 I'll tell you how to make a woman happy.
 You take charge.
 She comes home one night, you're in the kitchen naked cooking chili.
 You feed it to her out of your hands.
 Make her act like a bird.
 Damn it, I don't know.
 I've been married for 22 years.
 That's half as long as it felt like Arliss was on TV.
 You want to make a woman happy? You listen to her.
 'Cause guess what.
 She's always right.
 The women in our lives are queens.
 Honor your queen, Kenneth.
 If she wants to look at new window treatments, you go to crate barn.
 If she wants to have a dinner party, you go fry up some dolphins.
 She does say we never entertain.
 You're losing her.
 Go get her! Go get your woman! And speaking of which, Angie's been in the hospital for a week.
 Could you go find out why? Ooh.
 Thank you.
 Frank, you do stand-up.
 How would you like to have your own sitcom? Can I have a hot wife? If you gain 50 pounds.
 Yeah.
 Hey, I have an idea for a show.
 It's about a boy who befriends a talking panda, and they're allowed to sleep in the same bed.
 Have it on my desk tomorrow.
 Okay.
 Look, Jack, I know you think fixing NBC is just another negative synergy dynamics matrix.
 I wish.
 Then I could just solve it with a Schwarzfeld tesseract.
 No, this is the nadir of my career, Lemon.
 No room for advancement, a boss who doesn't get it.
 Every day, I wish some other company had bought NBC.
 Xerox, Alcoa, Paas.
 The Easter Egg company? They own their market.
 When was the last time you bought a non-Paas egg-dyeing kit? Try never.
 Paas is the best.
 Their wire egg dipper is tops in the industry with the thinnest egg loop to reduce dye lines.
 Exactly.
 Only I don't work for Paas.
 I work for Kabletown.
 But I have a plan that will fix everything.
 Okay, here's the thing, Jack.
 Your plan isn't gonna work.
 Your shows are terrible.
 I mean, have you seen that new game show Homonym? Your next word is "meat.
" Boy.
 Um Like when two people run into each other.
 Sorry, it's the other one.
 Your next word is "stare.
" Okay.
 Um, the things you climb to get No, no, it's the other one.
 It's always the other one.
 Let me see the card.
 No! Never! Your shows stink, Jack.
 Really? So you don't peacock them? I don't think so.
 But look, I get it.
 The clock's ticking, and you feel like time's running out.
 It's like me and everything.
 How long is this show gonna last? How many eggs do I have left? Will I ever finish reading the corrections? But you can't let that panic get into your head.
 Well, thank you for your feedback, Lemon, but I'm not panicking, I know exactly what I'm doing, so good peacock to you.
 But, Jack I said good peacock.
 Mr.
 Jordan.
 I mentioned your dinner party idea to Hazel.
 Yes.
 And I thought we'd have a little fete Chez nous ce soir.
 How nice to meet a woman who speaks the language of the Nazis' most enthusiastic collaborators.
 What a kind invitation.
 I do enjoy seeing the homes of poor whites.
 What should I bring? Just bring your fascinating self.
 Kenneth tells me that you started your own movie studio this summer.
 Yes.
 I'm sort of the black Tyler Perry.
 And I'm an aspiring actress whose most recent credits include running onstage during Sister act.
 This is wonderful.
 Tracy Jordan is coming to dinner.
 Just like in that episode of Family matters when Tracy Jordan came to dinner.
 You know I wasn't scripted to be in that episode.
 I just wandered onto set because Reginald Veljohnson owed me $40.
 I'm thinking about Vegas for the bachelorette party.
 We can't stay at the Palms.
 One of the Maloofs wants me dead, and the other one loves me.
 I don't remember which is which.
 Okay, great.
 Tracy, I need your advice.
 You like to throw parties.
 Why is everyone asking me for advice? I'm Tracy Jordan.
 Father of 3, married 22 years.
 I run my own business.
 My God.
 I'm the most stable adult here.
 God, I don't want to be Jenna's maid of honor.
 She wants her "something borrowed" to be Jessica Biel's youth.
 I don't know how to get that.
 If you don't want to do this, you should tank it.
 That's what I do when I want to get out of something like a schedule, a parent-teacher conference, or this boring conversation.
 Tank it? No.
 That's not "how I roll.
" Thank you for saying that in dated urban slang so that I'll understand you.
 Word.
 And I would certainly never tank on my friend Jenna.
 Because you're terrified of her, the way most white ladies are with their best friends? That is racist, and only part true.
 A good person doesn't intentionally do a bad job.
 I mean, look at Jack.
 He's in this terrible position at work, he wishes he were somewhere else.
 Is he tanking it? No.
 In fact, he's trying even harder.
 Tonight on NBC, Joe Rogan is Mandela.
 And if it's Wednesday, it must be cricket night in America.
 Then on Jay, a full hour of Gary Sinise's band.
 My God.
 Jack's tanking NBC! Turn your round.
 God cop scene 24.
 I know what you're doing, Jack.
 You are purposely tanking the network.
 Good God, Lemon, what is it with you liberals and your conspiracy theories? I've got bad news for you.
 The CIA did not invent crack cocaine, the Levees blew themselves up in New Orleans, and no one is trying to destroy NBC.
 Hang on, did you cast yourself in this show? What can I say? We saw hundreds of actors for God.
 Finally, the network executive said I should just play it.
 You're the network executive.
 Could we have a moment, please? Fine.
 You got me.
 I'm steering the Titanic into the iceberg.
 Why? Are you trying to get fired? I'm trying to get Hank to sell the network, and the only way to make him do that is to turn it into a money-losing embarrassment.
 This explains everything.
 How long has this been going on? Seven years, eight? Six weeks.
 I have an investor lined up who'll buy the network and keep me in charge.
 I can't tell you who it is, but his word is as good as the color consistency on one of his Easter Eggs.
 Adolph Paas? This is wrong, Jack.
 Lemon, I cannot go to another business school reunion and sit at the non-CEO table with the Women and nice men.
 You're right, Lemon, the clock is ticking for both of us, but if I pull this off, it's good for you too.
 You've never worked at a properly-managed company before.
 That's true.
 Before this, I ran an all-women's theater company.
 Everyone was vice-president.
 Think of the job stability.
 Less stress, a commissary that has taco Tuesdays again.
 After seven years, you'll finally have a life.
 And what if your plan doesn't work? Of course, it's a risk, but sometimes your only choice is to blow everything up and build something better out of the rubble.
 Look at Sherman's march to the sea.
 Or what my good friend bane tried to do to Gotham.
 Join me, Lemon.
 Help me tank NBC.
 Never.
 You're playing with peoples' lives here.
 Who do you think you are? God, we're ready for you.
 If there is one thing I have realized from being God, it's that the more you know, the more you realize you do not Know.
 Why is he learning anything? He's supposed to be God.
 Now, don't embarrass me.
 Tracy! Welcome to our home.
 Well, it's not technically a home, because no one's supposed to be living here, but welcome to our condemned site of the Candyman murders.
 Will you put this in the oven at about 200 degrees? My snake should be very comfortable while she gives birth.
 Mr.
 Jordan, please help yourself to some appetizers.
 Thank you.
 Your home is terrible.
 Shall we conversation? Yes.
 We're having weather.
 Much weather.
 So speaking of your movie studio This conversation has a real flow to it.
 Do you ever have any roles for white women who've been described by the Hollywood reporter as "some lady" who ruined the premiere of Paranorman? I always have one white person in all of my movies.
 We have to have a villain.
 And who's worse than us whites, right? I mean, look at slavery.
 That was bananas.
 That sturgeon just will not die.
 Excuse me a moment.
 I also do accents.
 Me a cockney person.
 This is your Uncle Bob? Liz.
 F.
Y.
I.
 Paul's family dog is gonna be the ring bearer.
 Zoltan is an 18-year-old German Shepherd who cannot walk.
 So you're gonna be in charge of him.
 No, Jenna, I'm allergic to dogs.
 Don't worry.
 He's hairless because of his insanity medication.
 Also, since this is a surprise wedding, you're gonna want to carry around your bridesmaid's dress with you at all times.
 Look how great this is gonna look next to me.
 You know I can't wear green, Jenna.
 The clinique lady says I have witch undertones.
 Liz, this isn't about you.
 Now, tonight, we have a tasting with the caterer.
 It's gonna be molecular gastronomy.
 The cake is a tasteless foam.
 There's no cake? Tonight on NBC Tank it, the reality event of the year where we make grandpas put on tank tops and then laugh at them.
 Tank it.
 You know what? I can't do anything tonight.
 Because tonight is your surprise bachelorette party! No way! You planned it already? Sure.
 And you should get your hopes way up.
 See you at my apartment at 8:00.
 Your apartment? Why? It's a surprise.
 And there's nothing worse than a surprise Lemon party.
 Kenneth, darling, why don't you run out and get dessert? But we have government ice cream.
 And that's what you're gonna serve to Tracy Jordan? I'm as shocked as anybody.
 Okay.
 Maybe the nice vending machine at the prison is working again.
 You're a real man, Tracy Jordan, playing it cool all night while I rubbed your foot under the table.
 My foot? No.
 That's shoe stuffing.
 It helps keep the shape of my shoes.
 Why was you rubbing my foot anyway? Please.
 You know what's happening here.
 I never know what's happening anywhere.
 Okay, let's get this party started! Ooh, I smell Italian guys.
 What is this? It's your bachelorette party.
 Bethany from work is here, and a bunch of my neighbors, a clown.
 And there's a God cop marathon on NBC.
 I think Esposito lied to us.
 What do you mean "you think"? You're God! I don't understand the rules of this.
 Let us pray.
 To whom? Before you say anything, I have one more surprise for you.
 Officer, we're ready! Thank God.
 Listen up, ladies.
 You're all in a lot of trouble if you don't protect yourselves against identity theft.
 Please take a pamphlet, pass them along.
 Okay, you're upset.
 But this is what you get when you choose Liz Lemon as your maid of honor.
 So let's get this over with.
 I mean, what's the worst you could possibly Tracy, I will do anything to play a villain in one of your movies.
 The camera loves me.
 Especially when I flash my baby blues.
 Why are they blue? Yeah.
 No.
 I'm married, Hazel.
 So am I.
 And if he ever wakes up from that coma, I'm dead! That's why I live for today.
 You're just using Kenneth, and I'm telling him everything! Whatever.
 Go ahead and try.
 I'm gonna have to try? Worst night ever! Just ask one of your famous friends to be maid of honor! Why do you think I asked you in the first place? Because you're not famous! You think I want someone up there with me that other people are looking at? I wanted you because you're nothing! Yeah, I get it.
 You didn't want to get Pippa Middleton.
 Why would you even mention her? Who's gonna be my maid of honor now, Liz? Nobody.
 From the rubble, I will build.
 Are you talking about me underneath your breath? Jenna, that's it.
 Nobody will be your maid of honor because there's only one person who can be.
 You.
 What? That's crazy.
 Think about it.
 There would be nobody to steal your spotlight.
 In fact, you would have two spotlights.
 I think the maid of honor should sing at my wedding.
 Sure.
 And she could do a fashion show that takes the audience all the way through the wedding night.
 And what if she came in in a wheelchair, and then stood up, and everyone applauded and cried? I know you doubted me, but now you see my plan could work.
 So what do you say? Are you on board, Liz? You just called me Liz! We can fix that in the cutting room.
 Jonathan Where's my car? Kenneth, I have something I need to tell you.
 Last night when you left, Hazel came on to me 'cause she wants me to put her in a movie.
 Hazel, is this true? Yeah, it is true.
 Not! What I said was I would never sleep with Tracy for a part in a movie.
 Please, you would love for me to fall asleep on top of you.
 Come on, Kenmore washers and dryers, who you gonna believe here? My best friend.
 Not really.
 And my girlfriend.
 You wish.
 Well, I always believe you, sir, because you're on television.
 And webisodes.
 But yesterday you told me our women are queens, and they're always right, which means I should believe Hazel.
 But that would make you wrong, Mr.
 Jordan.
 And you've never been wrong about anything before.
 It's a blessing and a purse.
 You can't both be right.
 Unless Hazel is always right.
 But only because you said so, Mr.
 Jordan, which means you're right too.
 And both sides being right is like kissing your sister.
 A wonderful treat! Bad move, Jordan.
 We'll see who's still working here in six months.
 My hearing is bad because of firecrackers, but we'll see who's still working here in six months.
 That's what I just said.
 What? Okay, I get it.
 Sometimes tanking it is the only option.
 What did you do? Fake a sprained ankle to get out of that breast health 5k? No, I did that.
 I forgot my sports bra, so ironically It doesn't matter, Lemon.
 I'm just glad that you've seen the light.
 Now, help me tank NBC, and you'll be helping yourself.
 You'll have it all.
 Jack, it's 9:30 in the morning.
 We're not trying to do a good job here, Lemon.
 Now, what do you say? Are you in? Let's take this mother down.
 Next word, "sent.
" I don't care.
 Okay, "cent" like a penny.
 Whatever.
 No! Sorry, no.
 It's a homonym double down.
 Means you get to guess again.
 "Sent.
" Okay.
 Then "scent" like a smell or an odor.
 No.
 It's the third one.
 Yourself! Next word is "au pere.
" What? There is only one definition.
 It's like a nanny, a foreign nanny.
 No! You forgot.
 It could also be an exclamation about a fruit, as in, "pear!" What you are doing here is not right! I'm I'm leaving.
    

                




                    			Very well, I certainly appreciate your candor.
 Were you just skyping with a horse? Not "a horse," Lemon.
 Rafalca, Mitt Romney's champion dressage mare.
 Sure.
 She answers yes or no questions by eating either an apple for "yes," or a carrot for "no.
" If she eats both, that means "life is full of unknowable gray areas.
" Remarkable animal.
 And thanks to Rafalca, I am now fully briefed on the Romney campaign's latest setback.
 Did you see the news this morning? I saw the Todayshow.
 So I know how to make an autumn pizza that your teen will love.
 Paul Ryan dropped out of the race last night.
 What? Why? Turns out he was actually born in Kenya.
 Not a lot we could say about that one.
 So who's Romney's running mate going to be? Rafalca assured me that an announcement would be made later today, or She just wanted to eat an apple.
 And how's tanking NBC going? Is Hank ready to sell? Soon, he'll have no choice.
 Sunday Night Football is just Cleveland Browns games.
 I'm allowing Jimmy Fallon to use his real voice.
 And the greatest band in late night, The Roots.
 And you're certainly doing your part.
 Last week's show was excruciating.
 Thank you.
 I told the writers there are no bad ideas.
 And they really took that to heart.
 Yes, I have a reservation under "black Hitler.
" You know, I could get used to this not caring thing.
 And what about your reproductive efforts? Bleh.
 Criss and I have been taking the dump truck to the bone yard most nights.
 Come on.
 Try to enjoy it, Lemon.
 Criss looks like a little elf prince.
 I should get back downstairs.
 Show's not going to phone itself in.
 I do have one concern, Lemon.
 Elections can be very good for sketch comedy shows.
 And the last thing I need is a election year ratings spike for TGS.
 So no political stuff.
 Okay, sure.
 We'll just have to rely on observational humor.
 Like, "table is a weird word.
" Thank you, Lemon.
 And you gotta wonder who came up with the door.
 Bunch of cavemen sitting around.
 "Hey, gronk! "Before we starve to death in here, let's make a door!" I S07 Ep02 Governor Dunston I have been waiting seven years to tell you people what I really think of you.
 Really? 'Cause you called me "Mr.
 Clean's Gay Uncle" in front of my children.
 This is my first royalty check for my summer dance jam, "Balls.
" In this envelope is my cut of every CD sale, paid download, music video DVD rental at blockbuster Boy.
 Jenna, you might want to look at that check before you insult us.
 And maybe you ought to look in the mirror before leaving your house in the morning, because you look like someone's been slowly poisoning Sally Field.
 Alrighty then.
 Read it and weep, you mouth breathing, vag repellers.
 It's $90, Jenna.
 What? How? That song was everywhere.
 The FBI blamed it for a spike in summer sex crimes.
 Well, the music industry isn't what it used to be.
 Thanks to Al Gore's stupid Internet, people can just get music for free.
 That's why I got out of the music business.
  Despite my beautiful singing voice   and my amazing songwriting  Hey, Jenna.
 Shut up.
 Hey.
 What are you doing here? Just thought I'd pop in.
 No, you damn well didn't.
 Lunchtime is when you "pop in.
" You've got something else on your mind, son.
 Fresh shave, elevated pulse, cologne.
 This man is here to do it on the desk.
 Tracy, you're disgusting.
 No, Liz, he's right.
 I am.
 No, but I'm not being gross.
 We're trying to have a baby.
 And you know how Liz's libido is.
 So I'm trying to keep it from being a chore.
 That's why I started tracking her menstrual cycle You don't have to prove anything to them.
 Just shut your mouth, Criss.
 I'm sorry.
 You're tracking my cycle? I don't want you stressing about it.
 So I made this calendar.
 I thought you'd like to know that you're ovulating.
 And I came here today to I don't know, spice things up.
 I know, it was stupid.
 No, okay, it's I get it.
 It's In the office.
 It's like I'm Don Draper and you're Megan.
 Okay, you're Don Draper.
 No, you're Glen and I'm Sally.
 Hey, this is a system.
 This is all organized, God.
 The post-its are for my ideas and the pens are for my tea.
 Liz, you have to see this.
 Hornberger, what if we'd been having sex? Then I would have seen Criss' muscular back.
 You think I care? The next vice president of the United States, Governor Bob Dunston of Alabama.
 Well, okey-dokey-doo, America.
 We gotta have Tracy play ts guy on the show.
 He looks exactly like him.
 I was thinking we would just lay off the political stuff.
 Liz, he's right.
 That guy looks exactly like Tracy.
 Did you guys see? I'm on TV but now I'm old.
 God, Liz Lemon.
 It's happening to you, too.
 Okay, fine.
 The guy looks like Tracy.
 But what's the joke? Ooh, I'm going to have to take a moment here.
 I sat on my testicles earlier and the heft of my body smashed them to smithereens.
 Okay.
 Start working on the wig.
 Ms.
 Maroney.
 I want you to meet my mother I'm going to stop you right there, Kenneth.
 I am having an actress side project crisis.
 So I'm not interested in whatever this is and whatever it thinks it's wearing.
 I can't believe I just met Jenna Maroney.
 I was so nervous.
 I hope I didn't embarrass you.
 You were fine, but your friend Ron sure doesn't know how to behave around celebrities.
 I am so sorry, Kenny.
 You know the only celebrity I've ever met was Evel Knievel's motorcycle.
 And that was just a picture.
 I almost forgot.
 We got you a little something for your birthday.
 Is that a CD? You people still buy cds? Kenneth's mother.
 O.
M.
G.
 Why haven't you visited us before? Well, money's been tight ever since the market crashed into our house.
 My my name is Ron.
 I'm Pearline's friend.
 I've met celebrities before.
 Do you know Evel Knievel's motorcycle picture? Come on, Ron.
 I'm better than that.
 I have so many questions to ask you people.
 Tomorrow, when we break for lunch, you are coming to my dressing room and watching me eat.
 I wonder what she eats.
 Now, I've been very up front about this.
 See, that girl was in my car because I was trying to talk her out of being a prostitute, and she Jack, I have to let Tracy play Governor Dunston.
 Absolutely not.
 Come on.
 He looks exactly like him.
 Give me a break, Jack.
 Listen to this guy.
 Hang on.
 I'm caught on a nail here.
 Okay, now we can continue.
 I can't just ignore Dunston, Jack.
 Everyone's talking about how much he looks like Tracy.
 NBC.
com had over 100 hits today.
 Exactly.
 I'm trying to tank this network.
 To that end, I have asked you to lay off politics.
 Uhhuh.
 But what you really meant was lay off Republicans, didn't you? This is not about politics, Lemon.
 In order to save this network, I have to destroy it.
 Just like BP did when they heroically tried to lubricate the Gulf of Mexico.
 Now, do not write anything about Bob Dunston.
 I promise.
 I won't write a word.
 Are we better off now than we were four years ago? Not me.
 I now have herpes.
 And the Dixie mafia is trying to kill me.
 Hey, elf prince.
 What makes you think my last period started on the 29th? Because you kept saying your Aunt Flo was in town.
 She was.
 Remember? I took her to moma and the cloisters? I assumed those were all vaginal euphemisms.
 Great.
 So we had sex for no reason.
 No reason at all.
 Thank you.
 Well Look, Liz, I know this isn't your jam.
 Which is why I've been trying to make it fun.
 I surprised you at the office, I wrote you that song.
  Your body is my garden of Eden  I hate you.
 I'm sorry.
 I hate you.
 Liz, we both want this to happen.
 But it's not going to work if it's a chore.
 Yeah, okay.
 I know.
 I have to relax.
 And I promise, as soon as I figure out when I really am ovulating You just spoke in German.
 I don't think so, Criss.
 I'm caught on a nail here.
 Caught on a nail.
 That was Tracy Jordan having some fun the other night at the expense of Governor Bob Dunston.
 Liz, the New York Times called.
 George Clooney wants to be on the show.
 And you got a gift basket.
 Gift basket? Pears? Why? Lemon, a word.
 We had an agreement.
 You promised not to write anything about Dunston.
 And I didn't.
 Every one of Tracy's lines last night was a direct quote from Governor Dunston himself.
 I see.
 Well, bravo.
 You're supposed to say "brava" to a woman.
 I am well aware of that.
 This is a disaster.
 Ratings are up.
 And now, during the election, Hank Hooper wants TGS on five nights a week, starting tonight.
 You are un-terriblizing this network.
 Wait, I have to do a show every night? Say goodbye to your free time.
 Did you hear that? That's the sound of honey boo boos piling up on your TiVo.
 No! Your show is ruining my career.
 And besmirching the name of a good American.
 Bob Dunston is a fine man.
 Aha.
 So this is about politics.
 I'm sure you'd let us make fun of Joe Biden all we want.
 But how could you? He's so amazing.
 He rides the train.
 Liz.
 Dunston's at a county fair and he ate too much chili.
 I'm sorry, Jack.
 This is bigger than both of us.
 Boy.
 When did old Bob Dunston swallow all this change? Pearline, you must be so proud of Kenneth.
 Smell him.
 That's Jenna Maroney's garbage.
 He's always been a special boy.
 I remember the day he was born.
 He looked up at me and he said, "mama, I am not a person.
 "My body's just a flesh vessel for an immortal being whose name, if you heard it, would make you lose your mind.
" Do you remember that, honey? We're just all so proud of Kenny.
 I tell everyone I meet, I know a big shot up in New York City.
 Great story, Ron.
 So tell me, what kind of music do you folks like to buy? Well, Jenna, you know, times are tough.
 And it's not getting any easier now that Obamacare's extending our life expectancy.
 Let me die in an emergency room with a treatable disease like an American.
 But music can let you forget about all that.
 Folks like us, we need an escape.
 It's just like what Jimmy Buffett says.
 "I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise.
" Of course, we don't have a stereo anymore, on account of our mayor, who's a meth addict, took it apart in a field.
 But Ron sings.
 He writes his own songs.
 Are they about being a loser? Some of them.
 But mostly, they're about being on a tropical island, and sipping some rum, and feeling the sand between your toes.
 What do you know about any of that, Ron? Kenneth Ellen Parcell, mind your manners.
 It just so happens Ron and I have been to Key West.
 Yes, we have.
 It was on our honeymoon.
 We My You got married? When? Seven years ago.
 Look, Ken, I'm just trying to replace your dad Dang it.
 That's the wrong thing to say, isn't it? If you will excuse me, I have to get back to work.
 This is terrible.
 I've never gone this long without talking.
 Okay, if we're doing a show tonight, Tracy needs to do a run-through with the vomit rig.
 Props can do 4:00 No, I promised Criss I would be home this afternoon.
 Yeah, for that.
 And get this.
 Criss wants to make it fun.
 How do you make sex fun? Well, Paula never opens her eyes.
 So what I do is look at a nursing school catalog I keep under my pillow.
 This five shows a week thing is bonkers.
 So, great, let's all figure out when I can have sex.
 Okay, what if Jenna did her DVD commentary while she was getting vajazzled? Then we could move the prop meeting up.
 You know what, we have to look at the whole month.
 Ooh, yeah.
 There it is.
 I need to cross-reference this with my menstruations.
 Ooh, this is complicated.
 I'm going to have to color code all of this.
 Tracy will be red, Jenna is blue, and I will be green.
 Ooh, yeah.
 That's nice.
 This is Mm, it's getting hot in here.
 If I had a column for my basal body temperature, then I could schedule around peak ovulation.
 Right there.
 Yes, that is the spot.
 God.
 This whole thing could be a spreadsheet.
 If we print it in landscape, the page will take it all.
 Yeah.
 It'll take it all.
 My God.
 Hi.
 Hey! That was ten dollars.
 I think I figured out what's been missing from my sex life.
 Organizing it.
 Cooter? Cooter Berger? Hi, Jack.
 I took the liberty of making myself a drink.
 Is that red wine with tonic water and olives in it? Yep.
 It's an old Spanish.
 Is that not a thing? The guys at the office told me it was a cool drink.
 I'm always getting pranked.
 Anyway.
 So, what have you been up to? Well, after 2008, I went back to being a lobbyist.
 You know, just hanging out in hotel lobbies.
 If you wear a red vest, sometimes people think you're a valet and you can take a nap in their car.
 Right.
 Well, it looks like you're back on your feet.
 And how.
 You're looking at the deputy chief of media relations, Romney-Dunston 2012.
 Here, have a sticker.
 Cooter, this is a puffy frog with googly eyes.
 No.
 I've been handing those out all day.
 Listen, Jack, the reason I'm here We need to talk about this whole Bob Dunston TGS thing.
 Yes, I'm taking care of that, I assure you.
 There will be no more Bob Dunston sketches on TGS.
 No, no, no.
 That's not what we want.
 We need you to make fun of Dunston as much as possible.
 What? Why? Because it's making him likeable.
 He's actually very mean.
 But with Tracy Jordan playing him He's a lovable buffoon.
 Exactly.
 Nobody's talking about the governor's record His re-segregation of the Alabama schools.
 His long-time sexual relationship with the Hank Williams statue outside Montgomery city hall.
 They're just talking about how funny Tracy is.
 It's a win-win.
 You help us take back the White House.
 And you goose NBC's ratings.
 Yes, and I do want NBC to get good ratings.
 Yeah, I know.
 Let's keep saying things we want.
 A closer friendship with you that includes road trips.
 Your turn.
 Jenna? Can we trouble you for some advice? Yes.
 If you're only in New York for a few days, find a way to see Amar'e Stoudemire's penis.
 It's worth it.
 All right, but we'd like to talk to you about Kenny.
 He won't even speak to me.
 Don, Garlene, I don't have time for this.
 I'm trying to write a new album for the only people who buy records anymore.
 Unhappy, middle-aged bummers like you.
 This writing is hard.
 Wait.
 You said you write songs.
 Yes, I do, but I'm not a professional like you, or them bears at showbiz pizza.
 Sing one for me now.
 For inspiration.
 I'm not going to steal it.
 But if I do, don't even bother lawyering up.
 I'll have my Jews on you so fast, you'll think you're an Asian girl.
 Well, okay.
 I wrote this song earlier today, for Kenny.
 You know, I just hope someday he realizes Okay.
  There's a picture on my wall   of a boy who's just yea tall   without a daddy, he's in danger   he needs an older male stranger   and when he goes to war  Okay, I'm going to stop you right there.
 Ron, that was terrible.
 I'm going to be constructive here.
 You should kill yourself.
 No, he should not.
 I am sorry, Ms.
 Maroney, but you don't talk to Ron like that.
 What are you talking about? I've heard you call Ron a dingleberry.
 Comparing Ron to our inconsiderate neighbors, the dingleberrys, is something I can do.
 But you are not allowed to.
 Because you are not A part of our family.
 That's what family is, Kenneth.
 People you badmouth all the time behind their back.
 Why, on the train right up here, I called you a bowling pin with a face drawn on it.
 A cheap albino lesbian.
 A finger with teeth.
 A hummel someone left on the radiator.
 I get it, mom.
 But if anyone else says a word about you, Kenneth, I don't stand for it.
 Do you remember that kid in school who bullied you? Well, I ate that goat.
 Because you and I are family.
 And, like it or not, Kenneth, so are you and my husband.
 Ronald McDonnell.
 I think I just got an idea for a song.
 It's called "rum-soaked tampon.
" Now, what were you guys talking about?  hey, girl   me and you   hey, baby   this is just more proof   that I am an amazing singer   does this song make you wanna do it?   you're welcome   girl, you're so beautiful   and so is the guy you're with   I just want to lick your face, eeh  Hey! Where you think you are, officemax? Get out of here, you perverts.
 Two minutes.
 Two minutes to air.
 Lemon, where have you been? You have a show to do.
 Don't worry about the show.
 It's all scheduled.
 Look at this.
 Yeah, mommy like.
 What's wrong with you? I've solved my intimacy issues, Jack.
 Now that the show is on every night, everything has to be organized Well, congratulations.
 I just want to make sure that you're doing a Bob Dunston sketch tonight.
 Why? Because of the, first amendment.
 Which I love.
 And what you told me earlier.
 You convinced me.
 You win.
 You think I'm an idiot? I didn't win that argument.
 I'm an idiot.
 Lemon, what do you want me to say? You're helping the Romney-Dunston ticket, okay? People like Dunston because they like Tracy.
 What? No.
 If these sketches are helping Romney, we're not doing them.
 Yes, maybe that's for the best.
 The success of your show is the only thing keeping Hank from selling NBC.
 And if he doesn't sell, I'll spend the rest of my career in corporate obscurity, like a woman with children.
 Damn it.
 But if I don't help Romney, it's four more years of socialism and corporations not being people and a basketball court at the White House.
 Let me make your choice easy.
 Jack, it's over.
 Yes, but is it that easy? You stop doing Dunston's TGS goes back to one night a week, you can kiss goodbye your Dusseldorf bus schedule sex.
 You'll be having Paris Metro sex.
 Long sessions of afternoon love-making, followed by talking and making circles with your finger in Criss' chest hair.
 No.
 You can't make me.
 Do the sketch, I help Romney, but I ruin my career.
 Cut the sketch, you help Obama, but you screw up your life plan.
 It's a win-lose.
 Tracy to the floor for the cold open.
 So what are we going to do? Break a leg, tray.
 That shouldn't be hard.
 I have a severe calcium deficiency.
 Gwen, I'm glad you brought up my record.
 It's called Sounds of seduction.
 And it's available on iTunes.
 There are nine types of legitimate rape.
 One a Halloween party.
 Let me ask you a question, sir.
 Do you know if this auditorium validates parking? Our opponent would like you to believe that Mitt Romney is a merman.
 Now, I know Mitt Romney does not live in the sea.
 A mormon, governor.
 A mormon? Now, that's crazy.
   

                




                    			All right, Lemon, you got me.
 Yes, this is the same flashy night tie I was wearing when I left work yesterday.
 My hair is a disaster.
 I am indeed on a walk of shame.
 You slut! That woman was Pizzarina Sbarro, the heiress to the Sbarro Slice and Calzone Fortune.
 I should be heading upstairs to change, I wouldn't want anyone seeing me like this.
 Come on.
 Walk of shame? I say call it a stride of pride and walk with your arms up, like this.
 That is surprisingly non-judgmental.
 I'm 41 years old, Jack.
 I'm no stranger to the walk of shame.
 Yes, I'm still wearing the same clothes as yesterday.
 I stayed up all night helping Bradley finish the Joseph coat.
 Just hearing that story tells me that Bradley was gay.
 Only sexually.
 But I've come a long way since then.
 In fact, since Criss and I have been trying, Liz Lemon has had a little awakening in her bathing suit area.
 Lemon, I've seen your bathing suits.
 That could be anywhere.
 I'm serious, Jack.
 I feel like I'm ready for one of those Sex and the city Girls' brunches, where you talk about dirty stuff and make a lot of puns, like, "and I thought I was eating eggs.
" So is Zarina your new girlfriend? Should I, invite her to my sex talk brunch? Zarina is not my girlfriend, she's one of a diverse group of women I'm currently seeing.
 Group? Back to judgmental.
 Lemon, after Avery, I realized I'm never going to find everything I'm looking for in one woman.
 It's not fair to the ladies, just because I'm the, complete package.
 You are a complete package.
 I got the idea watching The Great Escape on TCM one night, how that ragtag bunch of heroes worked together to be greater than the sum of their parts.
 Bronson was the brawn, Attenborough was the brains, garner was the scrounger, McQueen was the hottie with the body.
 I'll say it.
 And, how many prisoners do you have in this little stalag? Zarina is the society girl I take to black-tie events, when I want to talk politics I call Anne, Tabitha knows how to work my DVR, and Mindy is my, sex idiot.
 And what if they find out about each other? They're all adults, Lemon.
 They'll understand.
 And if they did come to blows, it would be Intensely erotic.
 Like, Steve McQueen on a motorcycle.
 Trying to jump that fence into Switzerland, but it's too high.
 He had a leather jacket.
 Hey, lady friends.
 Who would like to join me for brunch? My treat.
 We could throw back some cosmos, talk about our climaxes If you heard my sex stories, you would lose your mind! Sorry, Liz.
 I'm not even sure they serve brunch after The '90s.
 Liz, check this out.
 "Jenna Maroney, looking great at" Blarf! Okay, we are at a code orange here, people.
 A magazine has said that Jenna is 56.
 God, no I have children! We'll get through this together.
 Pete, you go down to the newsstand.
 Buy every copy, and burn them.
 Cerie, get out of here.
 Just go home for the day.
 And Kenneth, get Jenna's copy out of her dressing room before she sees it.
 Got it? My God, Liz.
 I am furious.
 You know what would make us all feel better? A ladies' brunch.
 These bitches are down for it.
 How can you be so calm? I mean, why would Tracy do this to you? Wait, what are we talking about? "I agree @therealstephenhawking.
 "Women are not funny.
 "Never have been.
 Never will be.
" Nerd rage! S07 Ep03 Stride of Pride How am I supposed to explain this to Jenna, who has been your comedy partner for almost seven years? Do you want me to talk to her? Honestly, I never realized she was trying to be funny.
 I guess I just thought she was a wig model.
 Unacceptable.
 Come on, Lem Lizzit.
 Name one truly funny woman.
 No.
 I refuse to answer this question with a list.
 It's insulting.
 You wouldn't ask an Asian person to give you a list of good Asian drivers.
 Gary Tang, Ziang Chu, Roy Chung Stop it.
 I was done anyway.
 Look, if women are so funny, do something funny right now.
 Welcome to the flower shop No! I don't have to prove anything to you.
 Maybe men and women find different things funny.
 Maybe things that men like are boring to women.
 No, everyone likes our things.
 Football.
 Motorcycles.
 Steak restaurants.
 Really dark superhero movies.
 These are things that suck.
 But women don't go around wasting our time writing articles about them.
 And I am not gonna waste my time engaging you on this topic.
 Well, that went well.
 See? That's the kind of hilarious button chicks can't come up with.
 What is it, Kenneth? I'm answering my fan mail.
 Nothing.
 Just doing my daily rounds.
 Mmm, my lips are so dry.
 I better wet them with this mop.
 No.
 Now my undershirt is wet with mop juice.
 I see what's going on here.
 You be the janitor, and I'll be the piece of gum on the floor that you just can't chisel off.
 Sure is hot in here.
 Maybe I should roll up my pants.
 Yeah.
 Show me that part of your shins that's hairless from your synthetic socks.
 Liz, Liz, Liz.
 Thank God.
 Also, I called in a fake page six item about how young Jenna is.
 I think our bases are covered.
 Okay, great.
 We solved our Jenna problem.
 We did it! Story over.
 Are you hungry? No, I'm okay.
 Do you want to go to a movie, or No.
 We can just do it.
 Okay.
 Zarina, hello.
 Jack.
 This is Mindy.
 Mindy, Zarina.
 Pleasure.
 Yeah.
 Shiny.
 Look, I know this is awkward.
 But we never said we were exclusive.
 And like a silver-backed gorilla or Mitt Romney's grandfather, I require more than one woman to Jack, I understand.
 I'm sure Mindy gives you certain things I can't.
 Indeed.
 The woman appears to have no hip joints.
 Thank you for being so Zarina.
 Another old guy wanted to buy my shirt.
 Old guys are so funny.
 Who is this? Jack, Ryan.
 Ryan, Jack.
 Ryan.
 What's up? Ryan is my sex idiot.
 So, the other night my boyfriend and I were making love, and I suggested that we wear sleep masks.
 I hit my nose pretty hard on the bedside table, but Liz Lemon.
 I just saw this hilarious dude on YouTube.
 You gotta put him on the show.
 No, it's Of course, a hilarious dude.
 What was it, some idiot who let his friend skateboard over his penis? Even better.
 It's a monkey, and his name is Professor Wigglebottom.
 A monkey? So no women are funny, but you want me to put a monkey on the show.
 My God, are we still talking about that? We debated this already, and I won.
 Tracy, I'm not putting any monkeys on TGS.
 Because you know what? I don't think monkeys are funny.
 How dare you generalize so crassly.
 I'm offended.
 Okay.
 Name one funny monkey.
 Bonzo, Clyde, the bear No! I refuse to answer this question with a list.
 It's insulting to monkeys, and their descendants Humans! I win again.
 You're okay with this, right, Jack? Of course.
 How could I not be? I'm great-escaping you, so you have every right to, do the same.
 My generation calls it pokemoning.
 Gotta catch 'em all.
 I assume your, sex idiot gives you something I cannot.
 Although I can't imagine what that might be.
 Really? So how many other pokemons are there? Jack.
 The plural of Pokemon is "Pokemon.
" Mindy Mindy No, Ryan Lochte! Look at me focus.
 Mindy.
 Ms.
 Maroney.
 Did you see this newspaper headline? Is Jenna Maroney partying too hard?" Be careful, you don't want to turn out like Amanda Byne-us.
 Did I do it right? That's a lie.
 I am much too old to party.
 I watch Castle, and my purse is filled with sweet'n lows.
 Liz, can I ask you a question? Don't let her take me.
 It's not gonna be a question, it's gonna be a series of mean statements.
 If I find out that someone around here planted this disgusting story that I'm young, I'm gonna do to them what I did to my own ribs Take them out.
 Jeezit was me, okay? I did it.
 Then Magazine said I was 56.
 Wait, you saw that? Well, of course I did.
 I planted it.
 What? Why? To escape the curse of the middle-aged actress.
 Instead of losing a push-up contest to Julie Bowen to see who gets to play Kevin James's mean wife who he's sick of having sex with, I'm gonna skip ahead to being an amazing slut who wins Oscars.
 I mean, how hot is Helen Mirren? Super-hot.
 I mean, have you seen that picture of her in a bikini? She looks amazing for Exactly "For.
" She looks amazing for a 67-year-old.
 She's actually not that hot.
 She's got a gut and British legs.
 All right, settle down.
 Well, now we know.
 It won't happen again.
 What if it's too late, Liz? I'm in the running for an endorsement deal with Geri-Chair, America's number one motorized stair climber.
 I know Geri-Chair.
 They're the company that makes my bed steps.
 You better not have messed this up for me, Liz.
 Because I will take them out.
 I'm scared, but it tickles.
 I am aware of this.
 Zarina is great-escaping me, and of course, I'm fine with it.
 Really? Because I've seen that look on your face before.
 When Jack Welch called you Rick.
 And I was fine with that too.
 I mean, he and I had met only, like, a million times, so why should he remember me.
 Maybe I should meet these other men in Zarina's Pokemon.
 No, bad idea.
 There are no bad ideas, Lemon, only great ideas that go horribly wrong.
 Look, when no conceivable good can come of something, don't engage.
 I would love to keep arguing with Tracy about whether women are funnier than monkeys I once saw a monkey in a cowboy outfit.
 I would love to see the town he's the sheriff of.
 The point is, why do I care what Tracy thinks? I don't, 'cause I know the truth.
 Women are just as funny as men, and you know the truth too.
 I do.
 I am the complete package.
 I don't need to know what one thing I give Zarina.
 I mean, who cares? Not me.
 Great.
 So we're not engaging.
 This is growth, Jack.
 And we are gonna celebrate by going to a brunch place and talking about my new sex-positive lifestyle.
 Absolutely not.
 We did it in the shower.
 My shoes got ruined.
 I said no! Sorry I'm late, everyone.
 I had to pick my friend up from the train station.
 Say hello, Professor Wigglebottom! That dude's awesome.
 See how he's wearing clothes? And he's got a suitcase like he's going on a business trip.
 Why's he being so professional? We should put him on the show! He could play a young Steven Tyler.
 He looks like me if I were fancy.
 See, Liz? Everyone's laughing! Because there are things that are just funny.
 Like monkeys, the three stooges, and me! And some things just aren't.
 Like females, and listing only two things.
 I'd like to see Lucille Ball do this on TV! Male nipples, funny.
 Monkey nipples, funny.
 Female nipples, useless! Engaging! All right, that's it! I will prove to you once and for all that women are just as funny as monkeys.
 Jenna and I are re-mounting our award-winning 1996 two-woman show.
 Right here, 4:00 P.
M.
, mandatory.
 "Thinking of you, sweetie.
 "X-O, Zarina.
" "Sweetie.
" Why didn't she write, "thinking of you, Jackie-bear?" She could have written this to anyone.
 Jonathan, get me a young person.
 Who has a social life.
 It's a group email, isn't it? This woman is pokemoning me.
 She's blind-copied you, but if you just click this plus sign Yep.
 There's the whole group.
 hip420@brooklyn.
beard, "ryunloktee" misspelled @swimteam.
org, kentremendous@fremulon.
biz totalpackage58 Wait, that's me.
 I don't care if it takes all day.
 I want you to teach me how to copy all of those email addresses and paste them into a new email.
 No, I understand.
 You'll let me know when you've made a decision.
 But okay, bye.
 How's it going, friendy? Well, that was Gerald Chair, the inventor of the Geri-Chair.
 They're leaning towards Jamie Lee Curtis.
 She already beat me out for Activia, and cold flash menopause popsicles.
 Well, this might not be the best timing, but I need a favor.
 Yeah.
 Today's the day when I'm gonna do my first favor ever.
 This isn't a favor for me, it's a favor for all women.
 We are gonna prove Tracy wrong Bored.
 And show him how funny women are.
 Are we, though? By Re-staging our old show.
 Our old show.
 Are you thinking, or doing kegels? Yes.
 Let's do it.
 But we have to do the doctor sketch, the one where I'm a little girl.
 Sure.
 Absolutely.
 And thank you for being a friend about this.
 Yes, friend.
 I mean, yes Friend.
 Thank you for coming in, gentlemen.
 I look forward to discovering exactly what each of you has to offer Zarina that I do not.
 I know she has a sex idiot for uninhibited experimentation.
 No, I'm pretty sure we're in love.
 A filthy hippie to make her feel bohemian.
 I get it, I can't give her that.
 Someone to make her parents angry Aw, man, is that all I am to her? It's 2012.
 Sorry, Norbert.
 The truth hurts.
 Interesting.
 A mean wall street type.
 I would have thoughtht I was the money guy.
 So what does that make me? Just the perfect head of hair? Hey.
 Sorry I'm late.
 Heavenly father.
 You must be Ken tremendous.
 I don't understand.
 What am I doing here? We've covered all the classic boyfriend archetypes.
 Except the father figure.
 Where is that guy, am I right? The one who falls asleep at the opera, and doesn't notice that she's texting her real boyfriend from his bed.
 Where's that sucker? No Is it me? Ladies and gentlemen, what you are about to see is a classic sketch from the Chicago area piven-nominated two-woman show, Maroney and Lemon.
 I take you now to this Doctor's office.
 Doctor, I'm unhappy with me widdle body.
 Can you help me? Well, of course.
 Toddler plastic surgery is an exciting new field.
 We can take you down an entire diaper size.
  This sketch is hilarious   take it from me   women are funny we can all agree   Carrol Burnett, Lucille Ball   no, not gonna do it   it's beneath us all   'cause we don't need to prove it to you   no, we don't need to prove it to you  "Tank" you, doctor.
 Don't thank me, thank Roe V.
 Wade.
  no, we don't need   to prove it   oh, I didn't see that coming   no, we don't need to prove it   to you  That was actually funny, Liz.
 So why do TGS suck so much? Thanks, Frank.
 Elizabeth Q.
 Lemonade, I owe you an apology.
 That skit was funny.
 Like, monkey funny.
 Thanks.
 That means a lot, Tracy.
 When you were, like, "come in, I'm a doctor," Yeah.
 And you had on that lab coat, like a doctor.
 A lady doctor My God, that is hilarious! Really? That's what you thought the joke was, there's a female doctor? Yeah.
 And Jenna, you as that sad old prostitute trying to look young Commentary! Old? Thank you, Tracy.
 That's the only reason I did this.
 And it was spectacular! Gerald! You came! You bet I did, baby.
 There's nothing older than trying to be young.
 And you looked like a million years up there.
 Congratulations.
 You are Geri-Chair's new spokes-crone! Lolo Jones, a man couldn't even do that doctor sketch.
 We would've just been sitting there listening to his medical advice.
 You were right, Liz Lemon.
 Women can be funny.
 You know what? I'll take it.
 Stride of pride.
 Jenna? Jack, I'm sorry.
 I didn't think anyone would be up here this late.
 Sometimes, I like to come up here at night and flash my breasts at the empire state building.
 Is that the only building that you flash? Or do you also flash the Time Warner center to make the Empire State Building feel like an old fool.
 Are you all right, Jack? You look like that flash card they told me means sadness.
 I have to break it off with a woman I'm seeing.
 I found out I'm just an aging squirtle in her Pokemon.
 That's tough.
 Accepting the way other people see us can be difficult.
 I mean, inside, I still feel like a sex idiot.
 But I have to accept the fact that I'm fake 56 now, and I'm more of a Diane Lane ageless beauty.
 But don't fight it, embrace it.
 Look.
 Do you really want this girl asking you to go hear her friend DJ in Brooklyn? No, that sounds exhausting.
 Do you want to drive five hours to go rock climbing with her, and be expected to have sex after? I do not.
 I mean, my back.
 So don't break up with her.
 Just be the older person.
 It's fun.
 You get to say racist stuff whenever you want, and people bring you soup.
 I do like soup.
 Okay, so maybe I never got my Sex and the city brunch.
 And maybe I never got to share the fact that I now know four different sexual positions, one of which involves a chair.
 But maybe a good relationship is more than that, anyway.
 All this talk of great-escaping and pokemons got me thinking.
 Is accepting who you are the secret to getting what you want? Action! Geri-Chair makes it safe for me to spend Christmas alone.
 Do men and women really see the world so differently? Or can we agree that we're all just monkeys with suitcases trying to seem like people? Well played, Professor.
 Wait You're a female? How you doin', girl? Can we get everything we need from one person? Or is that what friends are for, to be the allied P.
O.
W.
's and whimsical Japanese mini-creatures that help us get through life? Now, this is how people danced before Chubby Checker ruined everything.
 I guess what I'm saying is I need to modify my zappos order, so please email me back at your earliest convenience.
 Phyllis Diller, Joan Rivers, Gilda Radner, Lucille ball, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Carol Burnett, Lily Tomlin.
 Yes, thank you, Tracy.
 Those are all very funny women.
 Funny women? Those are the names of my fingers.
 Irma Bombeck, Tig Notaro Is my impression of a Chinese person.
 Wait! Hold on! Ellen DeGeneres, Mo'nique, and Roseanne Barr.
 Now that's some funny women.
 All of whom have screamed at me because they were on their period.
   

                




                    			 Come on, put it Excuse me.
 Out of the way, please.
 Hey! Chill out, mamacita.
 What's with the, weekday vibe.
 It is a Tuesday, sir.
 Hey, hey.
 You work on that show? Yeah, I work on that show.
 Just like your mom works that street corner.
 I'm sorry, that's too much.
 No sweat.
 My mom is a prostitute.
 Hey! This chick knows Jenna Maroney! Hey! New drinking game! Drink when someone says something! Who are you people? We're "Crabcatchers.
" You know, from Jenna's song Catchin' crabs in paradise?  I caught crabs in paradise  and, yes, I mean both kinds of crabs  I thought that was at least gonna be innuendo.
 Jenna is playing the Tod show, in a couple of days, so we're just camping out and "unwindulaxing.
" Wait, so Jenna's Jimmy Buffett rip-off is actually a thing? See, you people from New York, you don't know all the stuff that's going on in the rest of the country.
 Truck races, swamp parties, mall fires.
 I can't believe she's pulling this off.
 And I can't believe I'm pulling this off! Why do you have a tattoo of a seatbelt? So I don't get pulled over when I'm driving shirtless! You wanted to see me? Have I mentioned marisol, the Mexican sideline reporter I've been seeing? Well, since our weekend in Aspen, she's been put on pelvic rest.
 Fast-forward noise.
 Marisol was supposed to attend a fundraiser luncheon with me today.
 It's $10,000 a plate.
 And I'll have to eat the ticket unless Unless I eat the ticket.
 Fancy luncheon, seafood bar.
 I'm thinking 75 cents a shrimp, over three hours, and split Carry 3.
75 By the time I'm done, you'll be making money.
 Good.
 I should warn you, though, that it's a Republican fundraiser.
 So if you're coming, it won't be as Liz Lemon, huffpo superuser and gun-control lunatic.
 You'll come as Liz Lemon, my chum.
 Chum.
 Okay, I like that.
 And you'll be able to keep your opinions to yourself? Good Lord, Lemon.
 You just locked your mouth and then swallowed the key.
 It makes no earthly sense.
 Shrimp.
 S07 Ep04 Unwindulax Jenna's crab idiots won't shut up.
 Why couldn't she have died when that rabid dog bit her? It wasn't rabid.
 I just said that so they'd have to put it down, and then I'd be the star of that dog-food commercial.
 I had to walk an extra block to get around your stupid crabcatchers.
 My doctor's have been very clear about this, Jenna.
 If I get moderate exercise, I'm gonna die! And I'm mad at your success, but pretending it's something else! Okay, speaking of me, how many crabcatchers fiesta crab hats would each of you like to buy, at the unbelievable price of 49.
95? Please.
 I've had a crab on my head for free! I'm lying.
 The claws hold your cigarette while you uncork a "brew-skye.
" "Uncork a 'brew-skye'"? Yeah, you know.
 Ka-zap.
 Blinky, blinky, blinky, blinky.
 Those aren't even the right noises.
 Everyone knows you hate stuff like this.
 You're maybe the most high-maintenance bitch in Hollywood.
 Maybe? Who's more? Who is she? Okay, cut this crap out, and get those sunburned "D"bags out of the plaza.
 Hey, no can will, Pete.
 But have an unwindulaxing day You medical office before-pictures.
 I've never even seen a crab.
 I'm sorry.
 I don't need some Kenyan-born college professor telling m i didn't build my company.
 Because I earned my trust fund by always being polite to grandfather.
 Now, Donaghy, still over at NBC, with all those communists and homosexuals? Reginald, I believe you're thinking of the White House.
 But not for long.
 In two weeks, we take this country back.
 And no bureaucrat can force me to subsidize female promiscuity in the name of health care.
 Are you okay, chum? Michelle Obama's on steroids.
 And this is studio 6-H, home to TGS, starring Tracy Jordan.
 My God, it's Jenna.
 Visor lady, get a picture of me.
 What do I Press a button? No, it's different from every other camera in the world.
 God, I can't escape you people.
 Chill out, brother.
 It's beer o'clock somewhere.
 You're a fraud! And you look like a condom that's been dropped on the floor of a barbershop.
 Are you all unwindulaxing? This guy looks like he could use a little "latitude" adjustment.
 Will you sign my Cesarean scar? You moron! Hey, just a party foul.
 Exactly.
 That's why I said, "you more on.
" Like, "pour more on me!" Yeah.
 My God.
 Yeah! She can't be herself in front of these losers.
 She has to be "Island Jenna," which means We can mess with her.
 We should go to a pumpkin patch? Pranksmen, activate.
 Obama's bailout would never have worked if big business hadn't heroically taken it.
 But where's our parade? That's idiotic.
 Lemon! No, sir.
 You don't have enough shrimp to buy my silence.
 Also, you are out of shrimp.
 You know better, Jack.
 You all know better.
 Except for maybe the really inbred wasps.
 You thank for mention gordeau! You're hypocrites.
 You believe in the death penalty, but it's okay to kill animals for food? I don't know where I'm going with this yet.
 Hang on.
 Hang on! My boyfriend and I aren't married.
 But we might have a baby together anyway.
 And I hope it's gay Male gay.
 Because with the ladies, it's too much hiking.
 But homosexuality is unnatural, right? Then why are there gay dolphins, people? You heard me.
 They make love to their husband's blowholes.
 Let's see that in some science textbooks.
 That's right.
 The whole Texas board of education thing that I don't fully remember.
 Teachers should get paid a million dollars a year.
 If birth control pills fixed boners, you would get them free with your driver's license.
 How do we know that God isn't a tree? Ladies and gentlemen, this is Elizabeth Lemon.
 And, this is what we're up against.
 Four more years of a president chosen by people like her.
 She has an iPad subscription to The New Yorker.
 She vehemently opposes the Ivory Trade, despite the jobs it creates.
 And in her apartment there is a black-and-white photograph where you can almost see a breast.
 It's an original Leonard Nimoy.
 If we do not defeat Obama, then people like my little friend here will destroy this country.
 So add a zero to whatever you were planning to give.
 For Romney, for America.
 For anyone but her.
 What the hell, Jack? I thought you said I was your chum.
 You are my chum.
 The bait I throw in the water to attract the big fish.
 Damn it! Second meaning.
  Pour margaritas sunburn's starting to scab  Yeah.
 What are you douche-compadres doing here? Well, Jenna, everyone knows how you're always so chill.
 So, of course, you won't freak out when you see that Cerie is wearing that exact same shirt as a dress.
 The belt is a baby's necktie.
 Also, I found a bunch of your pre-nosejob headshots.
 You'll sign them so I can sell them online, right? Of course.
 'Cause who cares what you look like.
 All that counts is what's inside Your blender.
 I'm glad you feel that way.
 'Cause I've always wanted to give you a haircut.
 Yeah! You virgins, have no idea who you're messing with.
 Jenna.
 Unwindulax.
 I'm not just Jenna anymore.
 I am a God to those crabcatchers, and they will do whatever I say.
 So what? I'll tell you so what.
 For one thing, if you cross me or my army, you will never set foot in Florida again.
 Because that's our capital.
 But I'm judging Spike TV's Miss Nude divorcee in Tampa on Christmas Eve.
 And I was gonna visit MGM studios.
 The rides there capture the thrills and chills of the movies.
 And it doesn't end there, because my people are everywhere.
 If you ever want to pick your ball color at a putt-putt course, or have your alligator euthanized humanely, or fly on delta, you will back off, or the crabcatchers will come for you.
 Just as soon as it's cool for them to drive.
 It's a gray hoodie.
 It say's "who farted?" On the back.
 It's got a bunch of tampons in the pocket.
 I don't know what else to tell you.
 Lemon, there you are.
 Did your girlfriend even cancel? Or was this more Karl Rove trickery? Sorry, but I needed you to come, Lemon.
 This luncheon is a fundraiser for my personal super pac "Americans for an American America.
" I needed to unite the room around a common enemy.
 And Ed Begley Jr.
 Wasn't available, because the sail on his car broke.
 See, this is why 50.
1% of Americans hate Republicans.
 Because you're sneaky and cynical.
 Cynical? I think I'm the very opposite of cynical.
 I'm doing everything I can for my beliefs.
 And I truly believe that one rich person can make a difference in this country, and a roomful of rich people can change the world.
 Well, I also believe that one person can make a difference.
 With ideas.
 That really is wonderful.
 Harold, you have to hear this.
 Lemon, say that again.
 Ideas are more powerful than money.
 So what are you gonna do with all this money, Jack? Buy ad time? 'Cause I'm already on TV every night, with a little something called TGS.
 And we just got nominated for a stage managers' guild award.
 So you may have millions of dollars, sir, but America will hear my two cents.
 That's not what people want, Lemon.
 Least of all, from their televisions.
 They want their honeys boo boo and their Sunday night feetball, which is the plural of football.
 Americans don't want to think.
 That's why they need men like me to pick their presidents for them.
 Okay.
 So, I guess, it's my words versus your money.
 And we'll see who can really make a difference in this election.
 It's on, Donaghy.
 May the best gender non-specific person win.
 Just leave the amount blank, Harold.
 Those are tampons.
 Deal with it.
 For God's sake, some of us have jobs! I've got a pile of 1020-Gs up he with no travel times on them, and if I don't Listen up, nerds! Tonight, TGS is about to get real.
 We've got 38 minutes of air time An hour, if the bowling tournament ends early And we are gonna use it to get the message out there.
 I don't know.
 I think we've been hitting Romney pretty hard.
 I guess that's why they call me Mitt.
 "Baseball Mitt Romney" and "Barack a llama" aren't saying anything.
 I want to make a difference.
 We got to do something big, something that'll go viral.
 Like that otter that looked just like Tracy.
 Look, we've got the greatest resource in the world American celebrity.
 We get some hot young actor my grandnephew Kellan lutz, from Twilight, is visiting me.
 He's in my office.
 I have tolerated your pathological lying for six years.
 If you speak again, I will kill you.
 Great-uncle? Momma's baby is out of "marsh-mal-lows.
" Sweet grandnephew, I've been warming more "marsh-mal-lows" for you in the pocket of my dungarees.
 Okay, good job, lutz.
 Gentlemen, token silent lady, we have to spend all of our wonderful money, and help my hair-mentor, Mitt Romney, become the 11th legitimate President of the United States.
 Garrett, what does the campaign need? Well, as you know, with pacs like this, we're not allowed to have direct contact with candidates.
 I'm kidding.
 I'm Garrett Romney, Mitt's my dad.
 But here's the thing, Jack.
 My brother-dad, which is mormon for "dad," has more money than he knows what to do with.
 With all due respect, Garrett, I don't think that's a thing.
 Well, it's just, at this point in the campaign, for us, it's more about ideas than cash.
 Garrett, I would slap you if I didn't know you were going to get your own planet when you die.
 And until your father has I think we can still make a difference.
 I mean, look how poorly we're polling with African-Americans.
 Jack, there's no amount of money that could How dare you talk that way in front of the pile.
 Aw, thanks, Jack.
 There is no problem in the world that can't be solved by throwing money at it.
 Now, let's change some black minds.
 Look what Jenna's goons have done.
 Pete's going insane.
 The pranksmen are neutered.
 We can't let her get away with this.
 Well, what can we do? We're just three nerdy white guys, and she's got a whole army.
 But what if she didn't? I know what we should do.
 Pumpkin patch? Hi, I'm Hollywood liberal Don Cheadle, and I supp I support Mitt Romney.
 Good, continue.
 Barack Obama would have you believe that African-Americans are better off under his leadership.
 But I just got $10 million for appearing in an ad for Mitt Romney.
 So ask yourselves, brothers and sisters, who's really got your back? 'Cause from where I'm standing, Mitt Romney is a My dear Mitt Romney is a layup.
 But don't just take it from me.
 Take it from my good friend the black transformer, jazz.
 What's crackin', my homies? Jazz gets down with the rom-nizzle.
 My God, does he really talk like that in the movie? Paid for by Americans for an American America.
 "Dy-no-mite.
" For heaven's sakes.
 That is garbage.
 What are you talking about? That was don cheadle and jazz, your heroes.
 Do you know how expensive that was? Okay, I get it.
 Let me do some, community organizing.
 Sir, I am a deputized election monitor, and when my supervisor Barbara gets out of her aquarobics class, she will be hearing about this, if she's found the hearing aid she thinks her roommate stole.
 In five, four, three, two.
 Listen up, America.
 Thomas Jefferson once wrote The greatest danger to American freedom Shut up! Listen to the words! Is a government that ignores the constitution.
 Take it off! No.
 This is so demoralizing! In the past 24 hours, I've spent millions of dollars.
 I got B.
E.
T.
 to let Mike Huckabee present "Best Club Banger" at the Hip-Hop Awards.
 And yet we're still polling at 0% among African-Americans.
 If my money can't make a difference, I'm moving to Monaco.
 Jack, don't say that.
 I'm serious.
 Over there, they solve all their problems with money.
 They use it to put out fires.
 Ce feu m'ennuie.
 Why should I even bother to vote? New York will go for Obama even if I voted a hundred times.
 Instead of my usual five.
 Maybe you can make a difference in a battleground state.
 What's the point, Garrett? You know what? I'll tell you exactly how this election is going to play out.
 Hey.
 I just came in to see how my friend's doing, but obviously he went back into his mouse hole, so How are you? Jack was right.
 People don't want an idea bomb dropped on them.
 Don't give up.
 That is not the Lisa Loeb I know.
 Why do I even vote? New York's gonna go for Obama anyway.
 Maybe if I lived in Ohio, I could make a difference.
 Actually, no.
 Ohio's definitely going for Romney.
 Yeah, you don't know which way Ohio's going.
 But I do.
 Liz Lemon, I've done stand-up in every state in this country.
 I know the people of America.
 I know how they think.
 I can tell you exactly how this election is gonna play out.
 Everyone knows Romney has a vacation home in New Hampshire.
 What they don't know is that he hunts humans on that property.
 New Hampshire goes to Obama.
 Now, North Carolina goes to Romney.
 I worked there this summer, and they are not on board with a black man lecturing them.
 I don't care if it's Obama talking about health care or me talking about white butts.
 They are different than black butts.
 Pennsylvania is Obama's.
 The voting machines there have become sentient.
 And, for some reason, they are strongly in favor of gay marriage.
 But we're not gonna win Wisconsin.
 I don't know why.
 Ever since Tracy set fire to Lambeau Field, Wisconsinites are coming around on the death penalty.
 Wisconsin goes for Romney.
 That just leaves Florida, the penis of America! Florida The penis of America.
 Pete! We have a scheme to destroy Jenna and her army of cretins.
 For the past seven years, I've been compiling a supercut of all of Jenna Maroney's worst moments.
 Security footage, cell phone videos, rehearsals All her biggest diva freak-outs are on this DVD.
 When we put this online, the crabcatchers will see what a fraud Jenna is.
 Someone get a P.
A.
 to feed me baby food.
 Or I will drop a "D" in the greenroom.
 No, Pete! Why? Last night, after the show I went to give them a piece of my mind.
 Enjoy, bro.
 But before I could  Slow down they gave me peace.
  Way down  go down to the water there were no 1020-Gs down there.
 No neck pain.
 No fear.
 Just easy livin'.
 Something you mainlanders wouldn't understand.
 Pete, come on.
 Pete's dead.
 I'm Panama, now.
 Now, like any penis, Florida is very complicated.
 The Cubans in the South Very conservative.
 I had a lot of expensive cigars put out on me in Miami comedy clubs.
 But central Florida is dominated by Jewish retirees, serial killers, and secretly gay Disney princes, all of whom love Obama.
 Meanwhile In Northern Florida The only crowds I could never figure out were in Northern Florida.
 One week they're laughing at me, the next week, they're laughing at me.
 According to this, the electorate there is impossible to predict.
 It's a combination of elderly shut-ins, beach bums Bus passengers who ran out of money Swamp people and pirates.
 These people don't like to be told what to do.
 They just want to sit on the beach and drink.
 There motto is "unwindulax.
" Unwindulax.
 My God.
 Morning, Crabcatchers.
 You all unwindulaxing? One person can make a difference.
 And that person is Jenna! The next president of the United States will be chosen by Jenna Maroney.
 To be continued Mr.
 Spider.
 Ew, web in my mouth! Next week, on 30 Rock Will Jenna Maroney choose the next leader of the free world? Will Jack or Liz manipulate her into doing the thing we just said? Will Cerie ever wear a piece of clothing for its intended use? Will Pete drop the whole "Panama" thing, and have a totally different story? Spoiler alert Yes.
 Is Tracy actually a wereotter? Will Kellan Lutz fill his tummy with "marsh-mal-lows"? Will the invisible murderer who's in every scene finally strike? Will NBC's head of promotions ever get that mousetrap off his penis? Will Kenneth finally defeat his Nemesis, Mr.
 Spider? Will your DVR cut this pro   

                




                    			 Do you know what this means? No.
 I need a "previously on.
" Previously on 30 Rock It all comes down to Florida.
 And they will do whatever I say.
 Jenna and her 2 million Twitter followers might decide the election.
 And if we figured this out, that means Jack figured it out Go! Now! Before I lose interest! Going somewhere, Lemon? Nothing! Damn it! Liz, there you are.
 I need you to marry me so I don't get sent back to Canada.
 Really? Now you have a thing? Don't know why I was so worried about bringing my marble collection to work.
 Butterfingers! Why do we have that? Jenna, we have to talk.
 Me first, because I'm your best friend and this is very important.
 You know what? Talk to Lemon.
 I'll find someone else for my thing you're not right for.
 What thing? I was born for it.
 Am I not blonde enough? Because I'll put my head in a microwave.
 Jenna, stop.
 It's a trick.
 He just needs you, because you're gonna decide the presidential election.
 It's all about northern Florida, and they love you down there.
 Tell me about it.
 Jacksonville's naming their new airport Sized strip club after me.
 No bottoms.
 Just one tweet from you to your fans, and Romney wins.
 It'll be historic.
 The first really, really rich president.
 No, don't listen to him.
 What America needs is four more years of the stuff Obama's been doing.
 Like The one with the guy.
 It was at night, and I feel like he was standing next to a fence.
 This country needs Mitt Romney.
 Like it needs a hole in the head.
 A head has five holes, and they are all needed.
 Okay, you two can talk about America all you want, but I'm not gonna listen, because there's no "I" or "me" in America.
 There's both.
 I mean, if I'm gonna get political, it's gonna be to build a better country for Jenna Maroney.
 Jenna, this is a really big deal.
 I agree.
 It's an opportunity to finally put a pro-Jenna president in the White House.
 Someone who respects the human fetus and recognizes its value as a hair volumizer.
 You have 24 hours, then we'll all meet back here, and you present your cases.
 Maybe I'll ask questions.
 Maybe you two can take turns arguing.
 Like debate? Like debarge? I love debarge! No, Jenna, I said I love debarge too, Jenna.
 Point Jack.
 Looks like you have some work to do, Liz.
 S07 Ep05 There's no I in America Mr.
 Jordan, it's here.
 It's finally here! What is? My absentee ballot from Stone Mountain.
 Until this year, I wasn't allowed to vote because Reverend Gary said choosing is a sin, but then Reverend Todd said, "Reverend Gary is dead.
 Long live Reverend Todd," so here we are! Good for you, K-Rock.
 Voting is a great American tradition like laziness, or I'm so excited! I mean, the Parcells have been in this country since we went berserk and murdered everybody at Roanoke, but I never felt like a true American until today.
 Like how you must've felt four years ago when you finally got to vote for a president who looks like you.
 Black Shrek ran for president? No, sir.
 Obama.
 I forgot about that half-nerd.
 Probably because I get all my news from social media, and I've been banned from all social media.
 You have? Why? Someone has to be the first person to make a joke after a celebrity dies.
 I guess I was a little "too soon" with Andy Griffith.
 What did you say? I can't un-hear it.
 I can't un-hear it! Happy Election Eve! Obama 2012.
 The first African-American president ever to be up for reelection.
 Historical.
 Dude, that's not happening this year.
 No one's that excited.
 Then get excited.
 Remember how fun it was in 2008? Come on, we'll have a party, watch the returns, maybe invite the security guards.
 My God.
 Is this about Maria? Barack Obama is elected to be the next president of the United States of America.
 America! That whole night was a one-time thing, Pete.
 No one's gonna get that psyched a second time.
 Why not? It's like when you do karaoke and everyone's like, "that was a really good American pie, Pete.
 You knew all the words," and then you put it on again and everyone leaves because no one can top it.
 That's what this is gonna be like.
 Four more years! Four more years! That's the spirit! Four more years! Okay, Jack.
 I was hoping that we could get through this "campaign" without going negative.
 I agree.
 You're the one using negative words like "without" and "negative.
" Uhhuh.
 So, what was that attack ad that I saw on the TGS feed? Liz Lemon says she's Jenna Maroney's friend, but let's look at the facts.
 In 2011, Liz said The same polyps Jenna had prayed for.
 And what does Liz say when she's behind closed doors? Really, Liz? Liz Lemon Research indicates that that ad is polling quite well with both manic and depressive Jenna.
 You know Jenna's a liberal, Jack.
 She's a slut monster, and one of gay America's top hags.
 But this is what you do.
 You trick people into voting against their own interests, and then you sell them out at the drop of a hat.
 First of all, I have never dropped a hat in my life.
 And don't be so sure about Jenna's politics.
 She's aging, mean, and rich.
 That sounds republican to me.
 Jenna is overly sensitive, prone to hysteria, and having been shot and left for dead in three different deserts, pro gun control.
 She is one of us.
 Unbelievable.
 Seven years I've been mentoring you, and I haven't been able to move you an inch.
 Good God, Lemon.
 Enough with the histrionics.
 Herstrionics.
 Since you've known me, I've been right about no less than everything always, yet you persist in this impotent emotional weltanschauung.
 And it's not just politics.
 For instance, I bet you bought those hideous shoes for some emotional reason.
 For every pair you buy, they give a pair to a child that was forced to work in the factory that makes these shoes.
 It's not great, but you know what? I'm the one who's in a stable relationship, Jack.
 I like my job, and I am one punch away from getting a free deviled egg at that cool new deviled egg place.
 So maybe you should let me rub off on you.
 You wish, you pervert.
 Let me leave you with this, Jack.
 You may have your dirty tricks, but don't ever underestimate me when it comes to It's my gynecologist.
 Doctor, thank you for calling me back.
 Did anyone leave a bag of Burger King in your office? Local ballot initiatives.
 Proposition one empowers the Mayor of Stone Mountain to perform necessary repairs on the town's historic clock tower.
 That old clock tower.
 Nobody knows what it's counting down to.
 Well, I want to vote yes, but how do I know that's the right thing to do? Well, what do the pro/con statements say? Okay, writing in favor is Mayor Debbie herself.
 Hey! I'm gonna take the clock apart myself then put it back together.
 I wanna see how it works.
 My friend jojo did it with a toaster, and it's still good.
 Lemme do it! She makes some good points.
 But the con is written by the hermit what lives in the clock tower.
 Ain't nobody touch my clock.
 It's my wife, and it's where I do my sniperin'.
 Now I don't know what to think.
 Voting is a big responsibility.
 To this day, I have to live with the fact that I cast the deciding vote That made white the newest flavor of Mountain Dew.
 But I guess that's just life in a democracy.
 Hola.
 Mi amo Dora.
 Hey, Maria.
 Hey, it's election day.
 Huge party upstairs tonight.
 Just like 2008.
 I'll see you there? I wish.
 My shift ends at 6:00 now.
 So, you'll be gone before they declare a winner? Unless they call it early.
 Yes! Anything can happen.
 Hope and change.
 I think the slogan this year is "forward.
" Yeah! Welcome to the first and only debate of the Jenna-ral election.
 Insincere.
 Today, we choose the future for a nation and for a woman People magazine once called, "an unnamed friend of the deceased.
" Today, finally, it is truly all about me.
 Liz, we'll start with your opening statement.
 When your time is up, you'll hear this sound.
  Oh, say, can you see  And the home of the  brave Jenna, this election is about emotion.
 It's about which candidate cares the most cares the most about the issues that truly matter to Jenna Maroney.
 For example, your reproductive rights.
 Do you want a bunch of old men behind closed doors deciding what you can and cannot do with your body? And how do they tell me their decisions? Do I get shocked whenever I do the wrong thing? What? No, Jenna, not that.
 God.
 Earlier today, I met a family.
 The Alfreds from Lakecity, Florida.
 Sorry.
 Lake City.
 The Alfreds are huge Jenna Maroney fans because Jenna Maroney is so, so talented.
 Please hold your applause until the end.
 But under Mitt Romney, the arts program at Traci Lords middle school, where little Shauna is a seventh grader, would be gutted.
 Without music appreciation class, how would Shauna know how much she appreciates you? A world without arts programs sounds terrible.
 Where would young blonde girls like Shauna learn to act and sing? Why, if arts funding was cut, within a short time, our schools would be producing no new actresses.
 And Jenna Maroney would get every part.
 That's my America.
 That's Mitt Romney's America.
 My next question refers to an issue that I know deeply affects the vast majority of Jenna Maroney.
 Which political party is cooler? That's no contest, Jenna.
 The president listens to hip-hop rappings.
 We have the coolest celebrities.
 Scarlett Johansson, Blake Lively, Jessica Biel.
 Those are all very beautiful women.
 Do you really want to be photographed next to them? Let me tell you who we have.
 Craig T.
 Nelson, Chuck Norris, and Charlton Heston's skull.
 You'd be the only cool republican.
 Jenna, you need to trust me, here.
 Have I ever steered you wrong? I stopped you when you wanted to join that white tiger magic show.
 I stopped you when you tried to drive us into Lake Michigan because Scottie Pippin got married.
 Listen to me, Jenna.
 And listen to your heart.
 Miss Lemon, I know Scottie Pippin.
 I own a fuddruckers with Scottie Pippin.
 And you, sir, look like Scottie Pippin.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, your closing statements.
 When our founding fathers first set out time and time again, our nation horizon.
 Prosperity, dreams, freedom.
 But the spirit, journey, Destiny.
 Mitt Romney values, Jenna values.
 I've met people.
 For this generation, and generations to come, thank you, America.
 Good God, those are load-bearing balloons! Everyone run for your lives! Mr.
 Jordan, I need your help.
 What's wrong, Ken? I haven't been able to make a single decision on this absentee ballot.
 Should we take apart the clock tower? Should we let old man merkel marry his daughter? Or make him bury her like the rest of the dead folks? I'll never know enough to make an informed decision.
 Informed decision? Do you think this country was founded on informed decisions? Well, of course.
 Columbus thought he was in India! And did he worry about being wrong? No.
 He just called everybody Indians.
 And we still do it today.
 Why? 'Cause.
 You want to be an American? You fill out that ballot because you don't know what you're doing.
 Just like when we named this country after the fourth or fifth guy who discovered it.
 Amerigo Vespucci.
 Who cares? America.
 That's my boy.
 How do you sleep at night, Jack? I don't.
 I take thousands of micro naps during the day.
 Well, you know what? No, Lemon, what? I'm glad you never succeeded in turning me into you.
 Because I would rather lose with my head held high Partly because when I have it down it looks like this Than win the wrong way.
 Lemon, I don't enjoy manipulating Jenna for my own ends.
 To be perfectly honest, I don't like Mitt Romney.
 The man doesn't drink.
 How does he let a moment land? But I'm not going to allow those feelings get in the way of doing what is right.
 Think of the children, Jack.
 What if Jenna had picked the president when you were a little boy? Where would that kid be today? Maybe we should ask him.
 Boston.
 1968.
 Later, ma! I'm goin' down the park to play ball! I sure love America.
 Almost as much as I love chowder! I'm sorry, are you trying to make one of your emotional appeals to me? My God, it's future me! Lemon, this kind of sentimental nonsense didn't work with Jenna.
 It certainly won't work with the man who didn't cry at Field of Dreams, not even when the bank failed to recoup its investment in the farm.
 Fine.
 Enjoy your president.
 I'm moving to France.
 Except I can't get a decent iced tea there.
 Forget it.
 Everyone ask to vote immediately.
 This election has to be over by 6:00! Thanks for coming by.
 Okay.
 Williams! Williams, I need you to call it for Obama right now.
 Remember that time you got a haircut, and I was the first person to say, "someone got a haircut"? You owe me! Pete, you know we don't do that.
 Is this about Maria? It's not gonna happen this year.
 Look, get a hobby.
 Like me and my gymnastics.
 He's wrong.
 It's gonna be Remember? Hope, change, a Facebook that wasn't crawling with old, bald guys? Shut up, Pete.
 There's no hope.
 Not for you or for this country.
 If Joni Mitchell were here, she'd be like,  the big man won't give peace a chance   the cobblestones, cobblestones  Seriously, dude, let it go.
 It was just one kiss.
 Yeah.
 If you need a kiss so bad, why don't you kiss a potato like the rest of us? The kiss wasn't just a kiss! Don't you people get it? The kiss was Obama.
 It was proof that things could change.
 That night in 2008, everything felt possible, like my whole life was ahead of me.
 I was gonna drive a sports car and say cool stuff like, "wiki-what?" And none of that has happened! Nothing has changed! For Pete or America! And if we can't get that feeling back tonight, for Pete's sake, when are we ever gonna get it back? For Pete's sake.
 Jenna, it's 4:30 in Florida.
 Your fans should be waking up on a beach or getting fired from their telemarketing jobs right about now.
 Send the tweet.
 One sec.
 I got caught up in this Twitter war with this stupid spam bot.
 "Screw you, donna1dsdeluge.
 I don't need Viagra, you need Viagra!" Sorry.
 Now, who am I telling these turds to vote for? Mike Romney? Mitt.
 It stands for motorized intelligent technodrone termin It's a human's name.
 Excuse me.
 Does miss Maroney have a minute? Just to sign some autographs? Look, you don't really want Jenna's autograph.
 She's not a great role model.
 Where is the flash on this thing? I want to send esteluge a picture, but it's too dark inside my pants.
 No, my role model is Sara Blakely, the billionaire founder of Spanx.
 She's a genius.
 It's just kid's bike shorts for fatties.
 I'm gonna sell these on eBay.
 Well, it's always nice to meet a young entrepreneur.
 You know, when I was a boy, I used to go to Fenway and sell my urine.
 For fans to throw with Mickey Mantle.
 You'll be happy to know that things are looking up for capitalists like us.
 Between you and me, Mitt Romney's going to win.
 But people haven't voted yet.
 Shauna, this will be a good lesson for you.
 Voters don't really pick the president.
 That's up to important people like corporations and celebrities.
 This year, Jenna Maroney is picking the president.
 Got it.
 She is? Today, Jenna is the most important person in America.
 Maybe she should be my role model.
 What? No.
 No.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 I'm just saying, if I stop saving for business school and started saving for implants, I could be just like her.
 Thanks, sir.
 Okay, Jack.
 Now, what should I tweet about Ron Mee? Wait, he's not Asian, is he? Hey.
 I wasn't watching cute little kitten videos, I was watching pornography.
 Who put these sleepy kitten videos on here? Tracy, are you still banned from Twitter? For life.
 So you know, a couple more months.
 You must have a lot of bad jokes about deceased celebrities just filling up your brain.
 Yes, and they're pushing out important information.
 I don't know where I live, lady.
 If I got you back on Twitter, how quickly could you get kicked off again? Less if I count genocide as celebrities.
 Okay, well, you're getting back on on Jenna's account.
 No, I can't do that to my dear friend and co-worker Jenna Jameson.
 No, Tracy, Jenna Maroney.
 Cool.
 Okay.
 All I have to do is figure out Jenna's password.
 How 'bout "me69"? Yep.
 Tracy, no.
 No, I can say that word.
 I'm black.
 But Dick Clark wasn't.
 Hey! You're not really leaving, are ya? I know it's the second time, but it's our last shot at feeling This.
 Then what? Someday maybe we elect a wheelchair guy? Okay, great, but not fun.
 Look, Pete, this isn't 2008.
 I don't know, maybe if more stuff really had changed.
 Hey, sugar lips.
 Let's make like a black magazine and Jet.
 What's up, guy? Thanks for keeping my lady warm while I turn on my hot tub with my phone.
 Come on, baby.
 My 2012 corvette's parked outside.
 'Cause I always find a parking spot.
 You're him.
 That's right, pops.
 I'm Peter horn.
 All day And all night.
 Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well Nope, that's too many "Wells.
" I'm gonna reenter.
 Just spit it out, Lemon.
 I stole a page from your playbook, Jack.
 I used Tracy, I committed cyber crime, I got Jenna kicked off Twitter before she could endorse Romney.
 Deviousness? I guess two can play at that game.
 Just like most games.
 And now you're smiling because you're gonna try to tell me that this was your plan all along.
 "I turned you into me, Lemon.
 It was my plan all along.
" No, I'm smiling because I ended up telling Jenna not to do anything at all.
 I didn't want her choosing our president.
 No one should grow up in Jenna Maroney's America.
 'Cause of the children? Did my one-woman show actually change your mind? Should I workshop it at the fringe festival? Sure.
 Typical Donaghy.
 You sentimental, self-righteous, badger-faced shrew.
 Typical Lemon.
 You cynical, manipulative, cold-blooded adonis.
 So maybe we rubbed off on each other after all.
 Yours dripped on me and now I'm drunk.
 Good Lord in heaven.
 The Georgia polls close in two minutes.
 Mr.
 Hornberger, I just voted! Doesn't it just fill you with hope? Like anything can happen? All day, all night, baby.
   

                




                    			 What? Hold on.
 Your name is Jack Donaghy? That's hilarious.
 I bet your pardon.
 Where is your supervisor? You sound just like him.
 Now say, "don't talk to me like that.
 Don't you know who I am?" I will not say that because you just ruined it.
 Jack Donaghy.
 What, pray tell, is so funny? I'll give you something to laugh about.
 I can't believe he said it.
 "Jack Donaghy and black laughter.
" Hold up.
 You're Jack Donaghy.
 Why am I suddenly an object of derision in your community? I've championed diversity on NBC.
 I mean, we've got football.
 That's pretty black, right? I'm laughing because Jack Donaghy is the bad guy from Tracy Jordan's Aunt Phatso movie.
 But you can't shut us down.
 The $25,000 rap competition is in two days.
 Well, unless you can come up with $25,000 in just two days, I'm turning this community center into of my garbage dumps.
 Damn you, Jack Donaghy.
 S07 Ep06 Aunt Phatso vs.
 Jack Donaghy This is so embarrassing.
 I accidentally wore my tap shoes today.
 Well, might as well do my act.
 Now imagine I'm wearing underwear.
 Hazel, what'd I tell you last time you tried to audition for me? "Who's there? Please don't hurt me.
 The safe's in my children's room.
" You're not getting on the show.
 Too bad, Hazel.
 Look like everyone's onto your crazy now.
 Why don't you make like a woman driver and get lost? 'Cause I'd rather make like the father I never had and stay.
 Well, don't worry about me, Jenna.
 I've got everyone I need on my side.
 Who, Kenneth? The things he knows about you people For instance, someone here sucks on old baby wipes to get the alcohol out of them.
 Who does that? That's my thing! And one of the days, Kenneth's gonna tell me something I can use.
 And then I'll make my move.
 Well, time is running out.
 Tick tock, Hazel.
 The clock is ticking.
 Well, you know what else ticks? A time bomb.
 So, yeah, Jenna, tick tock.
 There she is.
 Finally.
 Liz, where have you been? I told you, like, ten times.
 I had a doctor's appointment today.
 My bunions are out of control.
 The podiatrist said the only possible explanation is that one of my ancestors mated with a dinosaur.
 Well, while you were out we had a little budget snafu.
 We can't build any new sets.
 So you're gonna have to completely rewrite tomorrow's show so that everything takes place in a farmhouse.
 Pete, the budget is your job.
 Who are we to stay what anything is? Okay.
 What did you write after Pete told you we're short? Liz, we spent a long time trying to come up with a good excuse for why we didn't write anything, but we failed.
 I put off this doctor's appointment for months.
 They had to saw me out of my sneakers.
 And I need quadruple-bunion surgery, but I can't get it because I would have to be off my feet for three weeks.
 And that would require someone else around here to actually step up.
 I would stomp off right now, but my doctor says I need to walk like this.
 Delightful Charlie Chaplin.
 You have the moustache and everything.
 What's the matter, Jack Donaghy? Did somebody accidentally swing a wrecking ball What are you doing in here? Lemon, do you think I'm a villain? I have heard you say, "guard, seize him.
" That was at a Knicks game.
 They needed to stop the clock.
 Why are you limping? A foot illness or fell running for food? I need bunion surgery, but I can't get bunion surgery because I have to do everything around here.
 No, you choose to do everything around here.
 You need an assistant.
 What? No.
 I mean, I can always use Cerie.
 Although, the one time I did send her on an errand she met some guy who flew her to Paris, and then she started modeling.
 And then she ended up being the reason why the French soccer team did so badly in the 2010 world cup.
 Hire someone, someone dedicated to making your life easier.
 I don't know.
 You wanna start a family, you have to prioritize.
 How can you take care of a child if you can't take care of your own feet? Hey, Grizz.
 Hey, Dot Com.
 Get me a black coffee, by which I mean, a sunkist.
 How could you think we're Grizz and Dot Com? 'Cause I don't see race, you white bastards.
 Tracy Would you care to explain this? What, pray tell, is so funny? Jack Donaghy, don't you know in this neighborhood you got to take your tires with you? Aunt Phatso, you're fired.
 You're all fired.
 What is this? That's Tracy Jordan's Aunt Phatso goes to the hospitals goes to jail.
 When did you make a movie? Fourth of July weekend.
 I wrote, directed, and did all of the makeup myself.
 It's terrible.
 We made $50 million In Atlanta.
 That man is portraying me.
 That's Leslie Van Vondervann.
 He's used to be on "knots landing.
" My twin is dead.
 Unacceptable.
 After all I've done for you I've brought you back from the dead and revived you career.
 And this is how you thank me? You will respect me.
 And you will respect these boobies.
 I want every DVD of this movie removed from stores, burned, and melted into a statue of you apologizing to me.
 I will do no such thing.
 The only statue that movie will be turned into is a N.
A.
A.
C.
P.
 shame award.
 Hey, is there another one of these coming out? Because I think I saw an ad for it in Urban Butt magazine.
 They have an excellent word jumble.
 The new movie's called Tracy Jordan's Aunt Phatso's Jack Donaghy's we at it again.
 You will not release that movie.
 You can't order me around.
 Who do you think I am? Liz Lemon? I will not have you talk to me like I'm some kind of Liz Lemon.
 Whatever.
 I'll speak at both your funerals.
 Typical Jack Donaghy, giving me no respect.
 I'm the CEO of my own company.
 I'm rich.
 I'm just like you! Just like me? I went to Princeton.
 I neglected a tiger.
 I'm on the board of the New York Philharmonic.
 I'm friends with Phil Harmonic, the worst rapper of all time.
 And I'm your boss.
 I own you.
 Think about that during your five-night appearance on Watch what happens live.
 No! Andy Cohen is so catty.
 And that's just the beginning.
 If you don't take care of this, you're fired.
 You're all fired.
 So tell me about your day, Kevin.
 I mean, Todd.
 Well, this morning miss Lemon had one of her meltdowns.
 Really? About what? Because she can't balance work and personal life.
 But I mean, after seven years and hundreds of these episodes, it's like, let's move on.
 Liz needs help.
 She needs someone who's ambitious and talented and humble and a liar.
 That's where Hazel comes in.
 Okay.
 Let me hang those up for you.
 You've got better things to do, you genius.
 Okay.
 Thanks.
 Also, I put all the new promos on your computer.
 And I wasn't sure how you take your coffee, so mouth or enema? What's going on here, Hazel? You need help.
 I know you're trying to get pregnant because I think about it all the time.
 You on top, your hair whipping around.
 But what if you do have a kid and you have to leave work because your daughter shot her choir teacher's husband? I mean, that's the kind of stuff my mom had to deal with.
 Okay.
 Well, I'm just not sure that I'm comfortable Did you get me a second mini-fridge? No.
 I got you a mini-freezer, full of candy bars so cold they'll crack your jaw, you bitch.
 I didn't say any Look, I wanna help.
 You're my hero.
 Just give me a chance.
 Sisters helping sisters.
 Glass ceiling.
 Legitimate rape.
 Okay, Hazel.
 I'm gonna get my foot surgery.
 And if you can be my eyes and ears while I'm stuck on the couch, you've got the job.
 Great.
 Now, if it's okay with you, I am gonna go wash your sweatshirt.
 You got it unstuck from the chair! Good evening.
 The New York Philharmonic is thrilled to announce that we've recently received a very generous donation that will keep us fully endowed for the next decade.
 In honor of that gift, tonight's scheduled program of Debussy and Rachmaninoff will be replaced with a selection chosen by our anonymous donor.
 So please enjoy a four-hour rendition of the theme song from Sanford and Son.
 Now who's in charge? Hazel, thank you, for taking care of everything.
 I can't believe you got my health plan to cover all this.
 You just need to know what to say to them, like their children's names and what they wore to school today.
 Will you send Frank in? I wanna see what they wrote to fill the fifth act.
 Or.
 Since I'm here to help, maybe I could fill the time.
 I still know my rhythmic gymnastics routine.
 I was good Until I hit puberty and the coaches said I got too pregnant.
 Are you kidding? I'm not gonna put you on the show.
 Lemon, a word? Hey, guy! You can't just walk in here whenever you want.
 How can I help you? So Lemon has an assistant? Excellent.
 Jack Donaghy to see Liz Lemon.
 A Mr.
 Donaghy here for you.
 Get off this channel! This is a military frequency.
 Okay, you can go in.
 So you got your surgery and the world hasn't ended? I think I can do this, Jack, all of it.
 I mean, right now, my feet are kind of like babies.
 I have to swaddle them, and they need ointment, and, like, six times a day brown stuff comes out of them.
 You're beautiful babies, yes you are.
 Look, Lemon, I need some advice.
 Tracy is actually trying to fight back.
 He ruined a wonderful evening at the philharmonic, paying them to play the same song over and over again for hours.
  I can't remember  I can't remember what it was  But the point is, the man is totally irrational.
 You know what? Tracy's right.
 You two are a lot alike.
 I beg your pardon? You're both stubborn, you're rich, you think you're right all the time.
 You wanted to prove that you're not like Tracy? Let it go.
 Or crush him, and prove you both wrong.
 Get two birds with one stone, like when I used Mick Jagger to lure Roger McGuinn and David Crosby to my birthday party.
 Listen yourself.
 You sound exactly like Tracy.
 No.
 Just the person I wanted to see.
 Hi, Kenneth.
 Look, I need to tell you something about Hazel.
 No, ma'am.
 I don't think I should talk to you anymore about her.
 You only have bad things to say.
 Hazel's my girlfriend.
 Kenneth, this sounds insane, but I care about you as a friend.
 I take in 50 calories a day and I'm using them all up just trying to help you.
 Then just be happy that I'm happy.
 You're happy because of Hazel? What could she possibly give you that I can't? Well, I'll tell you what she gives me, Ms.
 Maroney.
 She listens to me.
 Just tell me what it is.
 I tell her what happened during my day and she actually wants to hear about it.
 Can you give me that, Ms.
 Maroney? I don't know.
 Tracy, thank you for coming.
 Please, have a seat.
 No, thank you.
 I prefer to lie down.
 These are my lawyers.
 One is German, one is Japanese.
 And you don't bring these guys together to play Patty-cake.
 This is war.
 Bad news, Jack.
 War's my favorite card game.
 And I win about half the time.
 Here's the rub, Tracy.
 Because you were reckless enough to name your businessman villain "Jack Donaghy," I can sue you for libel.
 I'm gonna take every Penny you have.
 Not the ones I've swallowed.
 We'll see about that.
 Dude, it's not libel.
 Everything Jack Donaghy does in the movie, I've seen you do in real life.
 Really? When have you seen me do something like this? You're a menace, Aunt Phatso.
 But now that I'm on the city council, I'm cancelling your urban youth program.
 Lord! What? You did cancel a program for urban youth.
 It was my Saturday morning kid's show, Uncle Tracy's black teletubbies rip-off.
 I cancelled it because, like you, it was overly sexual and impossible to understand.
 Grabalujah! Fine! I've technically cancelled an urban children's program.
 But what about this assault on my good name? Not so fast, you crone.
 I bought all the wheelchair ramps in this city.
 And I'm turning them into more profitable stairs! When have I ever verbally accosted an old woman in a wheelchair? Liz Lemon, Another technicality.
 But the climax of this monstrosity That is what she said.
 Is when Jack Donaghy shuts down an orphanage.
 And I have never shut down an orphanage.
 You're right.
 I put that in just to have a part in there for a little girl in my movie.
 I'm Willow Smith-ing my daughter.
 Her album drops next week.
 Christmas Blankie.
 This is libel, Tracy.
 I win.
 Checkmate.
 Game, set, match.
 Rumbledy-goo Which is what you say when you win in polo.
 Tell me about your day.
 I'm listening.
 Well, Ms.
 Maroney, This morning, I was You're doing amazing.
 I wish you could see how sexy your listening face is.
 For Halloween, you should go as a slutty ear.
 What do you wanna do now? Sing? Yeah, let's.
  I'll be up here  and I'll be down here  Jenna's blonde as a sunrise   hot as the sun  bright as a shining sun  But with that being said, how do you know when you both feel the same way? I mean, sometimes I think  Jenna is listening  listening like the sun in the sky  Somebody needs to be changed.
 Need anything else, boss man? I guess just bring in the wheelchair so you can roll me down to the floor for the show.
 What? No, Liz.
 You had surgery this morning.
 Sure, but I have to be there.
 I would slap you if I didn't think it would lead to a kiss.
 This is about priorities.
 What if those feet were real babies? Would you walk on them to work? What kind of mother are you, you beautiful monster? Hazel, I have missed one show in seven years, and it did not go well.
 Josh, help me! You're not gonna miss the show.
 You're gonna watch it on the feed, baby girl.
 Idiot.
 I'll be next to Pete the whole time.
 And if there's an emergency, your wheelchair's right outside.
 Well, I guess that could work.
 Let me be your eyes on set.
 Although I can never match that amazing color.
 Criss calls it "old-timey football.
" Five minutes to air.
 Five minutes.
 This is really working.
 Hey, is that me? Okay, no, that can't be Brother, that's me! It's an old show? Son of a Well, this email is from Liz.
 Duh.
 Now, for my act, I'm gonna need a tarp because the first three rows will get wet.
 Why are my arms so weak? It's like I did that push-up last year for nothing.
 And two minutes to air.
 Two minutes! I'm sorry, babies.
 Wassername! Where am I? Pete roofied me.
 Seriously, Hornberger? You were gonna put her on the air? You told me to! I have your email.
 "P-Dog, let's use Hazel in the cold open.
 "Don't call me about this.
 Catch you on the flippy-floppy.
" That's you.
 You people killed my foot babies.
 My foot babies died because of this show! You're fired.
 You can't fire me.
 You don't even know my real name.
 Get out! Now! Did you just fire my girlfriend? She's crazy, Kenneth.
 No, she's not.
 Ms.
 Maroney knows the real Hazel.
 Tell them what I told you.
 God, what do I do? Help me, me.
 This one's on you, bitch.
 Were you not listening? I think a song right now would That's it! From now on, my relationship with all of you is strictly professional.
 We are no longer friends.
 I am just a co-worker who would do anything for any of you at any time.
 Nothing more! And we're live in three, two Yeah.
 They didn't write anything.
 Tracy, this is a surprise.
 I thought you'd be at home licking your wounds.
 No, that's why they put that cone on me.
 I just wanted to give you this.
 "You are cordially invited to attend the premiere "of Tracy Jordan's Aunt Phatso's "Jack Donaghy's we at it again.
 "A percentage of the film's profits will go to support the Knuckle Beach Orphanage.
" I don't understand.
 Without that money, the orphanage is gonna have to close.
 So if I shut down the movie, I actually will close down an orphanage.
 Which means the movie isn't libelous.
 Which means I can't shut down the movie.
 That's genius.
 You win, Tracy.
 You bested Jack Donaghy.
 Now you finally respect me.
 And that's all I ever wanted.
 I really can't stop you from portraying me as the villain in your films.
 What? Come on.
 Did you not watch the whole movie, Jackie D? Well, it's 47 minutes long.
 In the end, Jack Donaghy is not the villain.
 You win, Aunt Phatso.
 You bested Jack Donaghy.
 Now you finally respect me.
 And that's all I ever wanted Except maybe that hot little body of yours.
 Great Caesar's ghost! Aw, baby.
 Our thing sure is playing out just like the movie.
 Look, it's Liz! Good old Liz! Well, my feet are ruined.
 The show was an embarrassment.
 But I learned something super fun.
 I will never be able to have a family and work at TGS.
 It's just not possible.
 So what do I do? Don't ask me.
 Tracy's the genius here.
 Well, tray, I'm scared.
 Do I give up on my dream job, something I've worked my whole life to build? Or do I give up on my dream of having a family? Well, as a wise woman once told me Respect these boobies! Seriously though, what am I gonna do?   

                




                    			I don't want to look.
 Hey, come on.
 This is a win-win.
 If it's positive, awesome.
 We're having a baby.
 I want to name it Frisbee.
 If it's negative, awesome.
 We're not going to fight about the name Frisbee, and we get disco fries for breakfast, 'cause we're sad.
 I bet it's me.
 All those years trying to get on America's funniest home videos.
 It's just not fair.
 I mean, that guy gets a baby? What kind of idiot gives a little kid orange soda? Hey, dummies.
 Hey, Dennis.
 Hey, buddy.
 Why do you have a baby? Is this a scam? I don't need any scams.
 I got a brand new business selling suicide insurance, and it's going great.
 And this baby? This is my adopted son.
 Obviously he's going to be an athlete, so I only gotta save up for, like, one year of college.
 Wait, they let you adopt a baby? If by "they," you mean those guys or whatever, yeah, they let me and my wife adopt a baby.
 You remember Megan Duffy? Maiden name Duffy Hopefully no relation.
 I recognize you two.
 Did we have a four-way? No, St.
 Paddy's Day, remember, honey? Wait, it is? Yeah, we decided to adopt 'cause Megan's real career oriented right now, didn't want to wreck her boobs.
 Couple months later, boom.
 We got Black Dennis.
 His name is Black Dennis? That is racist.
 Yeah, right, Liz.
 The guy with the black son is racist.
 Later days, dummies.
 coming through.
 This is the new normal.
 S07 Ep07 Mazel Tov, Dummies! Tray, have you read any of these movie scripts yet? Yeah, I read the one about a handsome genius who lied to two idiots about reading scripts.
 You've got to choose the next project for your company, "dammit I'll pick a name later dotcom productions.
" You have pitch meetings all morning.
 Okay, it's almost 11:00.
 Please send in my 8:00.
 While on holiday in Tuscany, a middle-aged divorcee falls in love with a lazy pervert who's into hats.
 In a world with too much freedom, one young man dared to be different.
 "Hitler, colon, the boy who dreamed of stars.
" It's a Harriet Tubman biopic, entitled the Moses of Maryland I'll buy it.
 Sorry, I was talking on my Bluetooth to a guy at the octopus auction.
 I hate your idea.
 Tracy, NBC Universal has acquired the film rights to the YouTube clip, "Man loses pants on trampoline.
" How would you like to be the voice of gaboing, the evil wizard who would take jumping away from jumpland? Thank you for coming in.
 Running a movie studio is exhausting.
 I need a nap.
 Dotcom, tell us your most interesting story.
 Sorry, Tray.
 The next item on the agenda is your insurance physical.
 Great.
 Worst day ever.
 I mean, my name has been on adoption lists for years.
 But Dennis Duffy gets a baby because he's married? It's idiotic.
 You know who else was married? Ted Bundy.
 I don't think so, Liz.
 Really? So handsome.
 Is he still alive? The point is, anyone can get married.
 What, all of a sudden you're a better parent because you signed a piece of paper? Yeah, we're as committed to each other as any married couple.
 We live together, we love each other.
 I ignore it when you eat popsicles by biting them with your teeth, which is insane I love popsicles.
 We might as well be married, so So let's do it.
 Let's get married, like every other idiot on Earth.
 Me need a piece of paper to know how to feel.
 Der, Liz marry Criss? Doy.
 Er.
 Ey Wait, was that a yes? Are we getting married? Yeah, let's do this.
 We get a license today, get married tomorrow.
 Blammo.
 Engaged.
 Top gun style.
 Thank you.
 Jenna Maroney, you are my slave.
 What? But the sheik who won me in that poker game was beheaded.
 No, do you remember in 1994, you made a commercial for Surge cola? For 100 surge points, I got these shades.
 Yeah? For 500 surge points, I got this leather jacket.
 I can beat that.
 For a million points, he got me.
 Surge.
 Suck it down.
 I remember that.
 My boyfriend was supposed to pick me up after that shoot, so I called him, and I was like, "O.
 J.
, where are you?" And he was like, "wait, you're alive? Then who did I kill?" For 17 years, I've been buying up old cases of surge cola, and now I have one million surge points.
 And that means I own you.
 Hey, Jack.
 Do I look positively glowing? Well, you do have the wind-battered face of a New England cod fisherman, if that's what you're asking.
 No, I'm getting married.
 Jeez.
 Lemon, that is wonderful.
 To Criss, right? This isn't one of those Internet marriage scams where they prey on the elderly? Yes, to Criss.
 Then wonderful.
 No, but the wedding is not a deal.
 I mean, it's just a My God, this is the best hug I've ever had.
 I know.
 Anyway, it's just a formality, for if we want to adopt.
 We're going down to city hall tomorrow.
 It's no big whoop.
 But it should be a very big whoop.
 Lemon, this is your special day.
 Plan a real wedding.
 I'll get Tony Bennett to sing.
 I saved his life in an illegal pai gow game once.
 He owes me a favor.
 And you can wear that wedding dress that you bought No, I can't.
 I got rid of that after hurricane Irene.
 I had forgotten to stock up on toilet paper, but I had remembered to stock up on seven layer dip I got it.
 You know, I just don't care about this stuff.
 I don't want a "special day.
" I don't want to be a princess.
 But Lemon, you were a little girl once.
 Didn't you dream about your wedding? In my own way.
 Sol Rosenbear and I would like to thank everyone for coming to our destination wedding here on the love boat.
 Unfortunately, Sol has discovered my previous relationship with gopher, so he will be seeking an annulment once we reach Puerto Vallarta.
 I realized a long time ago that weddings aren't about love.
 They're just a giant industry that preys on gender stereotypes to make adult women spend a ton of money and act like selfish children.
 I mean, have you seen Wedding bitches on Bravo? Maybe there's not going to be a wedding.
 You're ruining my special day.
 Ma, what the are you wearing? I remember when Bravo used to air operas.
 I reject the wedding industry's phallocentric fairy tale grotesquerie.
 So tomorrow, Liz Lemon is getting married in a sweatshirt, no bra.
 For God's sakes, Lemon, don't take a stand about your own wedding.
 Think about that kid you're trying to adopt.
 What will you tell him if he asks to see pictures? I will tell her or it that I took an amazing stand against the wedding industrial complex.
 We are registered at Popcorn Palace.
 All right.
 Now that I've finished with my handwriting sample for the FBI, let's look at your test results.
 This is puzzling, Tracy.
 There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with you at all.
 What? I guess we've replaced so much of you over the years that you're maybe not you anymore, but you're healthy.
 No, this isn't happening.
 This is good news.
 No, it's not.
 I always assumed I'd die young, because, you know, I look so much like James Dean.
 And that gave me the freedom to live without consequences.
 That's why I'm always breaking the law, buying exotic sharks, forgetting to feed them, and then trying to hug them.
 I couldn't do cool stuff like that if I knew I'd be alive for How many years, Dr.
 Spaceman? I'm sorry.
 Look, I'm not happy about this, either.
 The money I've made off your health problems has put me almost all the way through medical school.
 I'm going to have to start living like there's a tomorrow.
 Open an I.
R.
A.
 Brush my teeth.
 Drink eight glasses a day of that stuff.
 You know, clear bathtub juice? Tracy, I'm afraid I don't have a pamphlet to help you get through this.
 But I do have a pamphlet that has a bunch of drawings of vaginas.
 I'll take it.
 To make a long story short, I need to be let out of my TGS contract.
 I'm moving to Arizona to be with my new slave master, Terry, to live in a birdcage he built.
 Why don't you both have a seat? You may sit.
 Now, Terry, I suspect you know it's illegal for someone to own another human being.
 Fine, but according to the contest rules.
 Either I collect my prize, or her equivalent cash value.
 I see.
 So you'd be just as happy with the money.
 Terry, is this true? I've done the math, and taking into account Jenna's salary and earning potential, I've calculated that she's worth $800,000.
 Let's say Jenna was worth that in her prime.
 That was ten years ago.
 She has certainly depreciated since then.
 Jenna is becoming more unemployable by the moment.
 And thanks to decades of partying, Jenna's internal organs will get you nothing on the black market.
 She's an emotional train wreck.
 Daddy, why are you doing this? A seventh grade education, hepatitis D, bullet in jaw, fatwa, credit card debt, wanted by the Yakuza Jenna Maroney is worth $2,000.
 Fine.
 In Arizona, two grand will buy me a castle and a pillowcase full of meth.
 Make it out to "Doomsday Enterprises.
" Goodbye, bitey.
 Well, I guess I need to read all of these scripts to determine which one has the greatest probability of succeeding in this ever changing global marketplace.
 I used to only say stuff like that in my white nerd voice.
 Jeez, I feel like we're at a Deli.
 Deli? Save it for the honeymoon.
 Okay, you take our paperwork to the clerk, because black women love you.
 I see you over there, you little gumdrop.
 Don't hide from Shanice.
 I'll get us some witnesses, and then we'll get married, and magically become amazing parents, just like the Hiltons.
 Here he comes.
 I'll give you a bath in the sink, like a baby.
 Excuse me, what number are you guys? Would you be able to stay and be our witnesses? You really didn't invite anyone to your wedding? No, I mean, who cares, right? We're at City Hall.
 You guys are wearing mets T-shirts.
 Yeah, 'cause we were wearing them when we first Met.
 My God, you're beautiful.
 This is the greatest day of my life.
 Now, let me guess.
 You guys are dressed like that 'cause you met at a laundromat after you both ran out of clean clothes.
 No, it's 'cause this is just a piece of paper.
 That's us! That's our number! Come on, our number.
 You okay? Yeah, you know, I just thought there'd be more people here in gym clothes carrying bags full of toilet paper.
 Look, we don't have to do it this way.
 You know, I always imagined getting married right when they take your picture on splash mountain.
 But weddings are about the bride, so if you want your special day I don't need a special day.
 You know, the first wedding I ever went to, I was a flower girl for my Aunt Linda.
 When they said, "you may now kiss the bride," I did my first ever eye roll.
 And today, I honor that little girl's eye roll with this masterpiece.
 That's how much Liz Lemon cares about having a special day.
 Great, 'cause I forgot my birth certificate.
 Are you kidding me, Chros? And even though Shanice said she'd let it slide if I sat on her hand, What? Liz Lemon, I haven't seen anything in the news about attitudes towards marriage changing forever because of one brave woman.
 Is everything okay? Everything's fine.
 I emailed Tony Bennett, just in case you came to your senses.
 He's singing at the White House, but will cancel for me.
 Also, I told him you're Italian, so he might call you "Tina.
" Okay, so we'll take another number, I'll get some witnesses, you'll get your birth certificate.
 It's not wedding stress.
 I'm no more annoyed right now than I was when you got that haircut without consulting me.
 Yeah.
 You can walk away from me all day, you little tiger cub.
 I work at the marriage bureau, but I'll never get married.
 Sir, we have a big problem.
 I didn't want anyone to see me like this, she lied.
 Jenna, when I said what you were worth, that was a negotiation tactic.
 $2,000, Jack? I've stolen more than that from my cleaning lady's purse.
 In this market, $2,000 is more than respectable.
 I mean, look at Kenneth.
 He's worth $5, tops.
 I'm going to hold you to that, sir.
 Is that supposed to make me feel better? Everyone around here is human garbage.
 Okay, well, then, look at me.
 If you're past your prime, then so am I.
 I've been divorced twice.
 I'm at an age where I no longer need erectile softeners.
 I'm number two at an American television company, with no possibility of promotion.
 I'll probably die in this job.
 I've already had one heart attack.
 I used to be a young man with promise.
 I coined the phrase, "you wish, pal.
" But now, I'm sitting here trying to cheer up a $2,000 actress, because a janitor said I hurt her feelings, so God.
 I'm worth less than you.
 Thank you, Jack.
 What are you doing? Why did you change your clothes? Well, this is what I was wearing when we met in riverside Park.
 Remember, you said, "nice turtleneck.
" No, I said "Nice turtleneck.
" And thank you again.
 Great, so now you're more dressed up than I am at my own wedding, but whatever.
 I got witnesses.
 These guys were in the park, either fighting or having sex.
 Okay, well, I thought it might be nice to have a witness we actually know.
 Of course, it had to be someone with nothing to do on a Wednesday afternoon No, no, no.
 You didn't.
 Mazel tov, dummies.
 You're Jewish, right, Liz? My God.
 What is wrong with you? You forgot your birth certificate, you invited Dennis.
 If you can't take this seriously, maybe there's not going to be a wedding.
 Okay, is this a big deal or not? I don't know.
 It's not the most important day of my life.
 Getting my show picked up, or meeting you, or the time I got a sleeve of starburst with all pink, those were all more important days.
 So you're yelling at me because Because I'm Liz Lemon.
 My parents spent the money they saved up for my wedding on a P.
T.
 cruiser.
 I have been sure for a long time that this was never going to happen, and I was fine with it.
 Ergo, it couldn't matter.
 "Ergo.
" Affleck's finally going to get that Oscar.
 And I'm still 90% right.
 It's stupid.
 It doesn't matter.
 Guess what? You wasted a lot of money on that dress.
 Actually, it was my grandmother's.
 She made it out of parachute silk while hiding from the Germans.
 Shut up.
 And then you came along, and now we're doing this, and a tiny little part of me that I hate wants to be a princess.
 Liz, it's okay to be a human woman.
 No, it's not.
 It's the worst, because of society.
 I mean, why do you watch Wedding bitches in the first place? And why did I find this hidden under your underwear ball? Sol Rosenbear.
 He never got enough time in his garden before he passed.
 I want today to be special.
 God, do you have any idea how hard it was to get you to admit that? "I forgot my birth certificate.
" "Let's invite Dennis.
" You were playing me.
 "I'll wear my stupid turtleneck.
" Wait, you think it's stupid? We're going to get married today, but we're going to do it right.
 We need rings and flowers, and I'm going to put on deodorant, and you're going to wear a suit that makes you look like a little marzipan candy man.
 So let's go, people.
 It's my special day.
 The Moses of Maryland.
 Page one.
 Interior Maryland slave shack, the year 18" Tracy.
 Tracy.
 Tracy, it's me, Harriet Tubman.
 Harriet? What is this place? Don't you know? It's your mind.
 We aren't so different, you and I.
 You grew up in the Bronx.
 I grew up interior Maryland slave shack, the year 18.
 And while I dreamed of becoming the first woman to surf around the world Really? Is that what you think I did? I only read the first page of the script.
 Use context clues.
 Whatever.
 I'm dead now.
 No, Tracy.
 You're not dead.
 I told you, we're in your mind.
 Why else would Harriet Tubman look and sound like your boss, Jim Dennison Come on.
 You know that's wrong.
 Wait a minute.
 If this is my mind, I should be able to control you.
 No, no, that only works in dreams.
 Eat a corn on the cob, and make it sexy.
 Great, so I'm not dead.
 I'm going to have to keep on living forever now.
 No, my homie.
 I can say that, because I'm you.
 It doesn't matter if you're healthy.
 At any moment, you could still get hit by a cab just crossing the street.
 Right.
 So there's still many ways I could die.
 I could fall into a manhole, or I could forget my chimpanzee's birthday.
 It's time to go now.
 Time to go back to being Tracy Jordan.
 Wake up.
 My God, Tracy.
 Are you okay? I almost died.
 I've never been better.
 Okay, good, 'cause I'm kind of in a rush.
 I'm getting married.
 Liz Lemon is getting married today.
 Liz Lemon's getting married? Harry Truman was right.
 Anything's possible.
 What a world I'm fine.
 Go get married.
 Okay.
 The next project is going to be toofer's Harriet Tubman movie.
 Are you sure, Tray? It's pretty boring.
 I read it in the bath on one of my Grizz days.
 It's perfect.
 'Cause it's the most irresponsible choice I can make.
 A super expensive period piece starring a middle aged woman.
 No one's going to want to see it.
 And I'm probably not going to be alive when it comes out.
 Now let's go buy a blimp to scout locations.
 It's about time, Lemon.
 Whatever, just get down to city hall.
 It's 30 minutes away.
 I'll be there in 10.
 Navy, gray, maroon, gray Am I depressed? Later.
 You'll do quite nicely.
 Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
 Black Dennis, start the car.
 What? It's the only white dress I own.
 But your hair.
 I'm a princess.
 And will you be exchanging rings? Tito was a drug dealer the police shot in the face.
 In Riverside Park, where we first met.
 It's perfect.
 Do you take this lady as your wife? I do.
 Do you take this man I do.
 "'But you see, ' said roark quietly, 'I've chosen the work I want to do.
 'And I can find joy only if I do my work in the best way possible to me.
'" By the authority vested in me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
 My lip is caught on the grill.
 Lemon, earlier today, I took a hard look at where life has led me, and I didn't like what I saw.
 But now, looking at you, I realize That anything's possible? You know, I'm attractive.
 I've got cheekbones, and a pair you can do something with.
 I'm just saying, from a grateful nation, thank you, Liz Lemon.
 There's hope for us all.
 Black Dennis got some cop's gun.
   

                




                    			 Married,  Liz Lemon got married and made up this song  You got married? To what? To Criss, Frank.
 You are now looking at Ms.
 Elizabeth Lemon.
 I'm keeping my name.
 What? The h-e-double vibrator is that thing on your left hand? It's my wedding ring.
 I got married yesterday.
 How could you do this to me? Flurb? You just ruined my surprise wedding.
 Paul, you can come down now.
 Thanks a lot, Liz.
 I guess I ate all that asparagus for nothing.
 Reverend Gimp, we'll just have to reschedule.
 Where can I get the "C" train? Well, if you don't want this kind of thing happening, maybe don't have a surprise wedding.
 Alisters always have surprise weddings now, Liz.
 Timberbiel, beyon-z, Anne hatha-nobody.
 And technically, I am an a-lister now because I was on a list to date Tom Cruise.
 But I bailed before I got sucked in too deep, praise Xenu.
 Well, I'm glad you're happy for me.
 In case you didn't hear it before, I got married yesterday.
 Yeah, thank you for inviting me.
 Congratulations, Liz.
 It's inspiring to see that a woman in her 30s can still find true love.
 I'm 42, Cerie.
 I don't know what that is.
 Just a reminder that your awards luncheon is today.
 What? You won an award.
 "Congratulations on being named one of the 80 under 80, honoring women in entertainment who aren't Betty White.
" My goodness, the ceremony will be broadcast on lifetime com.
 garbagefile? Okay, but still, I won an award! S07 Ep08 My Whole Life Is Thunder Okay, big Liz Lemon day, so hold on tight.
 I've got a Jenna problem I need to run by you.
 Lemon, I'm sorry.
 I can't help you.
 Why not? Our dynamic doesn't have to change just because I'm married.
 We can still have our classic girl Friday banter.
 "Now you listen here, Jack.
 This story's not gonna write itself, see?" "Stop, you brute.
 I love you.
 Operator?" No, the problem is my mother's in town for Christmas.
 Already? It's three weeks away.
 She insists on traveling on pearl Harbor day to, and I quote, "show the emperor we're not afraid.
" Look, I know she gets under your skin, but you should appreciate this time with her.
 She's 87.
 But that's only 14 in demon years, Lemon.
 The woman's constant disapproval of me will keep her alive forever.
 A blue spruce.
 What time do the mariachis arrive? But this year I have a plan.
 I'm not going to give her anything to disapprove of, because as long as she's in New York, I'm doing absolutely nothing.
 I got the idea from watching your president Obama the last four years.
 That's her, fishing.
 Notice the ring is shriller.
 Jack Donaghy's office.
 No, Mrs.
 Donaghy.
 He's not doing anything.
 He's with Liz.
 Well, she's wearing it pulled back, but it's not working.
 Exactly.
 Because of her ears.
 Merry Christmas, everyone.
 Kenneth, why are you mopping the floor so angrily? You know exactly why, sir.
 First miss Lemon fired my girlfriend, and now Hazel broke up with me.
 Mr.
 Jordan, do you know why I love television so much? Because despite cell phones, iPads, and computers, it's still the most effective portal for poltergeists? On TV shows, nothing ever really changes.
 The people you care about never leave, and the bad guy always gets what she deserves.
 Someone's looking lovely today.
 What a burn.
 I could have meant someone else.
 Although I didn't.
 She's radiant.
 Since I'm not getting married today, I might as well stuff my face.
 Listen, Jenna, I didn't mean to steal your thunder.
 My whole life is thunder.
 Sure.
 But, you know, I just found out that I won this women in entertainment award First you get married.
 Now you're winning an award? These are my things.
 Next you'll tell me Mickey Rourke catapulted you into the Hollywood sign.
 Look, I know you're angry, but this award is kind of a big deal.
 You know, in the past, they've given it to Diane Sawyer and Elaine May, and did you know that Chuck Scarborough is anatomically a woman? So I am a lesbian.
 And I'd really love for you to be there.
 Did you know it's been 15 years since we first met? Salutations, Jenna Maroney.
 What brings a mummer to lightsman's row? I just wanted to meet the woman that's been lighting me so awesomely onstage.
 Do you have any idea where she is, little boy? And I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for you, so when I accept that award on lifetime.
comgarbagefile, I want you onstage with me.
 So there'll be cameras? Yes.
 Liz, you had me at "Hayden Panettiere is dead.
" Of course I'll be there.
 Thank you, Jenna.
 That really means a lot to me.
  Secret plan  revenge on my mind Hey, I'm going downstairs to get a coffee.
 You want anything? Pumpkin spice, please.
 Great.
  Secret plan Excuse me.
 I don't mean to bother you, but I'm a nymphomaniac virgin widow, and I just completed my year of mourning, and I've got a hotel room and a latex allergy, and, well, I was just wondering what you were doing for the next 12 to 14 hours.
 I'm doing nothing.
 Let's go before my mother Nice try, mother.
 Yes, you sensed I was doing something you would disapprove of.
 Your powers remain strong, old one, but there's nothing you can say to ruin this.
 I see a spot in front of my left eye.
 If this turns out to be a stroke, you're in charge of plucking my chin.
 You better come home, Jackie.
 I have a few things I want to say to you before I meet the grim reaper, who is black, I assume, what with the hoodies he wears.
 That's quite all right.
 I've heard your last words before.
 For instance, in junior high, when you faked a heart attack to keep me from going camping.
 I didn't trust that scoutmaster.
 He was always wearing shorts.
 In fact, I think I have your dying speech memorized.
 "How could you do this to me? "You're such a huge disappointment.
 "If only Dragnet hadn't been preempted because of Sputnik, you never would have been conceived.
" Please, Jackie, just come home! I'm dizzy, Jack.
 Wonderful sound effects, mother.
 Mother? Mother? You left crumbs on the floor so that the mice spelled, "come see me"? Yes, Kenneth, I've been thinking about what you said about wishing life could be like TV.
 That would be great, although I'd get rid of those ads that pop up in the middle of your favorite TV shows.
 Well, why don't you discuss it with special guest star Florence Henderson? Mrs.
 Brady! I told the black guy here, none of that Brady stuff.
 Now let's get this over with.
 Which booking is this? Are you the perverts who want to go to town on each other while I make a pie? Welcome, ladies.
 Welcome.
 I'm Bonnie badamath.
 I'm the chairperson for today's event.
 I can't shake hands because I have carpal tunnel syndrome from zipping up my own dress now that Gary's gone.
 Well, I'm very happy to be here.
 Well, I'm just so glad that you found the place, what with my directions, Because Gary was the navigator.
 Thank you.
 This is exciting.
 Look, you're in the program.
 Great, they must have gotten this picture off the Internet.
 Why does the other Liz Lemon always come up first? Who cares? They're honoring you.
 Now you go find our table.
 I'm gonna run to the bathroom.
 I have to go too.
 Wait for me.
 I just went, but I guess I could go again.
 What the what? My God, she's gonna do her wedding just to ruin my thing? My best friend.
 Best friend troubles, talking to yourself, I've been there.
 And you know why Jenna's mad at me? Because I got married.
 You know what my best friend did for my 50th birthday? She gives everybody a car, and then she's all, "thank you for coming to Gayle's birthday!" The crazy thing is I always end up apologizing to her 'cause her feelings are so much more important than mine.
 I hear you.
 When I got bangs, my best friend didn't even acknowledge them, so I was gonna grow them out.
 Then after reading an article in my best friend's magazine, I realized my feelings are valid, so I had to say to her, "my bangs, "they're not about you.
 It's about me trying to cover my forehead.
" Exactly.
 Thank you.
 We're talking about Oprah, right? No, of course not.
 She can hear us.
 Well, this is certainly high drama.
 These are the clothes that I want to be buried in.
 And make sure I'm holding this.
 Glue this pin to the inside of the coffin lid.
 For grave robbers.
 For grave robbers? I remember the first time you ever threatened me with your death.
 You should be more appreciative.
 I went down to a pack a day for you.
 One day, you're gonna turn around, and I'll be dead like that.
 All right.
 You can knock it off now, mother.
 I'm home.
 What happened to your eye? Did you really fall? I was watching TV, and they started interviewing an Asian Santa claus, and my arm went numb.
 And you called me? Mother, call an ambulance.
 My father did not kill dozens of Germans so that his daughter could die in a van.
 But he wasn't even in the war.
 Go about your day, Jack.
 Just leave the door open and let the elements take me.
 You're going to the hospital, and I don't care how I have to get you there.
 Well, I'm not going in an ambulance.
 I'll take a horse-drawn carriage.
 Those carriages are rolling torture wagons for nature's most dignified creature.
 The horse is one of only three appropriate subjects for a painting, along with ships with sails and men holding up swords while staring off into the distance.
 Sure, let's argue about horses now.
 Bring down my things.
 I'm going out of this world exactly the way I came into it, wearing a hat.
 There you are, K through 12.
 Are you the same guy as before? Or does that sun-bleached turd have a twin brother? Same guy, ma'am.
 Looks like we're stuck in a elevator.
 I guess we'll have to remember stuff and learn from each other, just like on TV.
 Wait, you did this on purpose? Are you sure you know what you're doing? Apex technical school puts students first.
 And the perfect time to enroll is now.
 Wait, we're stuck? Get us down.
 I don't have my flask.
 I'm freaking out.
 This was a bad idea.
 Is this alcohol-based? Why are you doing this to me, Jacob? So our next honoree Liz Lemon is the head writer of TGS with Tracy Jordan, and I am told she got married yesterday, just like Gary and that bitch who was selling us our dream house.
 So let's take a look at Liz's work.
 Hang on.
 This is being weird.
 Blow on the disk.
 Is it on the right component? Try unplugging it and plugging it back in.
 Just open the disk part and blow on it.
 Looking for this? You ruined my wedding.
 It's payback time.
 Jenna, what I did was an accident, but you're trying to sabotage me just because I'm getting an award? You know you don't deserve it.
 Without me, you'd still be behind that light board in Chicago, turning bags of sour patch kids inside out to lick them clean.
 I got my money's worth.
 And without me you'd still be doing local commercials for store-brand douches.
 Well, joke's on you, because that wasn't a commercial.
 I don't know what that was.
 I swear to God, you are the most selfish human being on the planet.
 Thank you.
 Visit my website for extras and ringtones.
 Only because I've let you be.
 It stops tonight.
 You can't stop me from getting on that stage.
 Are you sure? 'Cause guess what this lighting board nerd did? So what can I do for a fellow lightsmith? I want you to come up 20% on 16, 32, and 70.
 No, but that would Just do it! Well, this stage is now lit for grocery store milk aisle.
 I can't get up there.
 I'll look Horrible.
 Yeah.
 No.
 Did I ruin your wedding again? Also you need to tell your Aunt Mary, when she was two, there was an accident with a hot comb.
 Well, she used to be a boy.
 Stop talking, mother.
 Save your strength for yelling at doctors.
 There's a couple of other things I want you to know, Jack.
 And I don't want you to interrupt me until I'm done.
 All I want is for you to be happy.
 Happy? Yes.
 Since when did you ever care about happiness? Don't talk to me like that, Jack.
 I breast-fed you for nine years! Those are terrible last words.
 The closest you ever get to happiness is when you're criticizing something, preferably something I've done.
 Jack, stop talking.
 I am not going to be around forever.
 Here it comes.
 One of these days, you're gonna turn around, Jack, and I'm gonna be gone Just like that.
 When this little performance is over, I may put you in a home just like that.
 Mother Mother? I can't get it to work, and there's still so whatever, Liz Lemon.
 No, you don't ruin my thing.
 I ruin your thing.
 You are not the center of the universe, Jenna.
 I am too.
 I'm the moon.
 Ladies, please, today we're celebrating women Can it, Bonnie.
 I can't believe you're doing this to me.
 And Paul.
 He's been in that steamer trunk for hours.
 It's all right.
 The lack of oxygen is making me orgasm.
 Why can't you ever be happy for me, ever? I got married, and you don't care.
 Why should she? We shouldn't be defining ourselves by our men.
 So in order to be independent, we have to be asexual? You would know, Judy.
 God, I miss Gary so much! I put his sweater on a body pillow! I took it for a canoe ride! Lightsmith, help me out.
 Fire up the lekos and the klieg.
 Don't look at me.
 Don't look at me.
 Don't look at me! Jack, I got your text, but I think there was some autocorrect problems.
 Colleen had a fart attack? She died, Liz.
 My God.
 She had a heart attack and died on the way here.
 Jack, I am so sorry.
 Before she died, Colleen told me she just wants me to be happy.
 Really? 'Cause that doesn't sound like her, but I guess people do say strange things at the end.
 You know, my grandmother said, "Liz, stop playing with the flesh around my elbow.
" "I just want you to be happy.
" You know who you say that to? A loser.
 Someone who can't hope for anything more in life than just being happy.
 You say that to someone who has disappointed you.
 Jack.
 No.
 It's perfect.
 She's a genius.
 One last twist of the knife.
 Well, thank you for coming, Lemon, but I better get going.
 The funeral is tomorrow.
 Colleen wanted to be buried before the rest of the family found out and sold her body to a haunted house.
 And, of course, I get to eulogize Colleen at the service.
 One more chance to disappoint her as she looks up at me from her throne In hell.
 Jenna Jenna.
 I mean, Liz.
 Look, life's too short to be fighting with your best friend.
 I know.
 Can I be real with you, Liz? All these years I've always been able to look at you and feel better about myself.
 Sure.
 Don't interrupt.
 The pill that lets me feel emotion is gonna wear off soon.
 Watching you struggle at work, dating losers, wearing boys' husky jeans They have reinforced crutches.
 Now you're winning awards, you're not aging the way I wanted you to, and you're married to a guy that I think about during sex.
 Awwugh.
 Everything feels a little upside-down, but I am happy for you.
 And I'm sorry you weren't at my wedding.
 But it made me realize that this whole surprise wedding thing is stupid.
 When I get married, I want everyone I care about to be there.
 Jenna, I feel like you and I haven't talked like this Pill wearing off.
 You have mom arms.
 Kenneth, it's Hazel.
 She's back.
 I recast her.
 She tested through the roof At the STD clinic.
 Mr.
 Jordan, stop.
 I don't want my life to be like TV anymore.
 Because no one learns anything in elevators, and we almost killed Florence Henderson.
 Yes.
 Almost.
 I don't want my life to be like TV, because my life is way better.
 Where else but real life would a millionaire movie star care so much about a hillbilly janitor that he would spend two days trying to cheer him up? You can't do that on television.
 Because, if you did, no one would watch.
 Thank you, Mr.
 Jordan.
 Thank you for my wonderful life.
 I sure picked the right week to come back.
 You weren't supposed to have any lines, Kwon Lee.
 Now I have to pay you.
 Friends, last night when I sat down to write a speech worthy of my mother's 87 years, I thought I was facing an impossible task until I realized that her constant crushing disapproval was a gift.
 The greatest gift a mother ever gave a son.
 My lifelong quest to please that woman is what made me the man I am today, the man who has been the centerfold of Fortune magazine no fewer than three times, the man who in 1984 wore a tuxedo so well he broke up the go-go's, the man who last night wrote and today will deliver the greatest eulogy of all time.
 Dublin, 1852, a ship Bobs in the Lee tide of the icy Irish Sea.
 Her name Ariel.
 Today, we are all Irish.
 And the plumber says, "I don't know.
 But that's a pretty big pizza.
" Life is for the living! But there's a truth in the center of that.
 Thank you, Kermit, for explaining the afterlife to us.
 Listen, Jack, thank you for being the man we all aspire to be.
 Ladies and gentlemen, sir Paul McCartney and the Harlem boys choir.
 Yaaay! And, though the falling snow would erase her footprints, it could never erase our memory of her.
 I love you, mother.
 End of eulogy.
 Wonderful, Jack! Wonderful! Jenna, no, don't do this.
 Jenna, yes, do this.
 All the people that I care about are here.
 It's perfect.
 We are so glad that you could come, Liz.
 I hope traffic wasn't too bad getting here.
 Surprise.
 I'm getting married.
 Mother would have hated this.
 Yaaay! And I promise not to make fun of you when you ask where your glasses are and they are on your head.
 I do do that.
 And I promise to always pour antibiotics all over your penis before you staple it to anything.
 And now Paul will read the vows he has written for Jenna.
 Jenna, I didn't know what I was missing in my life until I met you.
 I love you more than words can say, and I am so honored to be taking your first and last name.
 Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Mrs.
 and Mr.
 Jenna Maroneys.
   

                




                    			Liz, I've helped a lot of women who are struggling to conceive.
 I know how trying the process can be, because I've been through it myself.
 Carol, they're towing your car! Damn it.
 My kids are in there.
 No! How? I came all the way up to Westchester just to avoid you.
 This is Westchester? I am lost.
 Now, fertility shots That's a euphemism, right? No, my husband and I are trying to conceive.
 I'm gonna write you a prescription for progesterone injections.
 That's a female hormone.
 Now, I know what you're thinking, and the answer is no.
 If a man takes it, he won't grow breasts, although that would be awesome.
 No money for the whorehouse? That's fine.
 I'll just look down while hiding my crotch with an oriental fan.
 Injections? "Injections"? Yeah, injections.
 Are you Dr.
 Leo Spaceman? Come with us to Washington.
 You've just been named surgeon general of the United States.
 Hey, that's a series wrap on Leo Spaceman, suckers.
 Bye.
 S07 Ep09 Game Over Are you doping? Liz Lemon, that stuff will shrink your testicles, but there are bad side effects as well.
 No, Tracy.
 Not that it's any of your business, but I am starting fertility treatments.
 Now, I'm not a woman, so of course I can say whatever I want.
 This seems really weird and unnatural.
 "Side effects include mood swings, increased irritability, and swelling of one or more boobs.
" Can I help you with something? Yeah.
 I'm about to start shooting my new Harriet tubman movie, and I got octavia Spencer to play the lead Harriet something.
 You know, I once played Frederick douglass in a one-woman show that the university of Maryland Diamondback called "too confusing to be offensive.
" Point is, I won't be at rehearsal at all this week.
 No, Tracy.
 Exactly.
 No Tracy.
 Thanks for being so understanding.
 Good morning, Jack.
 Hank.
 I was so sorry to hear about your mother.
 Thank you, Hank.
 I remember my own mother's passing.
 She wanted to be cremated, and she ended up dying in a fire.
 Such a considerate woman.
 Well, on a brighter note, I should wish you a Happy Birthday.
 No, no.
 It's not my birthday yet.
 And it only counts when it's actually on your birthday.
 I have very strict birthday rules.
 One birthday boy always sleeps in the largest tiger cage.
 Some of the rules may be specific to my time in Vietnam.
 Now, Jack, as you know, the Kabletown board is meeting this Friday.
 I promised my wife I'd step aside when I turned 70, but it's very important to me that control of Kabletown stays in the Hooper family.
 But my kids are creative types.
 Yes, I understand that Hank Jr.
 is writing a children's book about a giraffe who learns he doesn't have to work hard.
 But they say sometimes it skips a generation.
 I think you know my granddaughter.
 Sir, Kaylie is only 15.
 Yeah, but when she gets out of college, she'll be 21.
 That's the same age I was when I started Kabletown, got married, and had my first white child.
 Hank, please think about your other options.
 Jack, you've done an excellent job with NBC.
 I admit I was skeptical when I first saw your fall schedule.
 "What? Is this guy trying to tank the company?" But, boy, you proved me wrong.
 Celebrity homonym is the number-one show in America.
 The word is "racket.
" Okay, "racket," like a tennis racket.
 Sorry.
 It's the other one.
 Again? You know what, pal? Why don't you come over here and tell me that? I am grateful.
 That's why I came up with a solution that will make everyone happy.
 Until Kaylie graduates, you'll be her assistant CEO.
 "Assistant"? CEO.
 She'll be on the board, learning the ropes, and you'll keep her chair warm.
 It'll work great, just like Conan and Jay.
 Have you ever updated your flash player? It is so sad.
 What happens to version 11.
4? What now? I'm taking hormone shots to have a baby, you son of a bitch! A beautiful little baby.
 Being a woman is the worst.
 Lemon, Hank Hooper just told me I will never be CEO of Kabletown, but he doesn't know about my secret weapon My mother's death.
 Wait.
 So we're both crazy? No.
 I've spent my life trying to win my mother's approval, but she never gave it to me, which means I can't ever stop trying, even when faced with an impossible task, like making Hank choose me over his own granddaughter.
 How much time do you have? Three days.
 It's exactly the kind of challenge my mother's anti-love prepared me for.
 I'll make you proud of me yet, Colleen! It'll either be my masterpiece, or I will resign in shame.
 Just like poor Nixon.
 He did good things in China.
 Hey.
 Octavia, excellent, you're black.
 Now, in this scene, you're gonna enter through the door.
 I don't think so.
 I'm gonna walk in from over here.
 But the door.
 Well, you're just gonna have to rewrite the script and explain how my character can go through walls.
 Also, I want to wear a t-shirt, promote my website.
 But slaves didn't wear t-shirts.
 That sounds like a Tracy problem, Tracy.
 I'm done for the day.
 I got to go home and feed my eels.
 They're not electric, but I have a plan.
 Mizz, Dotgov, let's roll.
 Len, I'm in the endgame here with this Kabletown situation.
 Do you have anything on Kaylie for me? Well, Mr.
 Donaghy, you asked me to pull out all the stops on this, so I went deep undercover, and I applied for a job as a drama teacher at Kaylie's school.
 Hi, I'm Ms.
 Foster, but, please, call me Jan.
 Boy, Jay-Z and Shakespeare have nothing in common.
 Or do they? Fyi Jan Foster is currently in a "lesbian relationship" with Ms.
 Siegal from the math department.
 Okay, I don't know why you had to be a woman.
 Let me worry about that.
 The point is Jan took these pictures this morning outside school.
 She thinks you'll be very interested in them.
 Banks.
 Pedal faster, fatties.
 God, I love how much you disgust me.
 Class dismissed.
 Really, banks? Spin class? Isn't that a bit of a gay cliche? You're the gay one.
 Wanting to be with a woman How gay is that? You win sex against a man, that's as straight as it gets.
 You were good One of the best.
 But look at you now.
 Hitching your wagon to a 15-year-old girl? Look, I understand why Kaylie would seek you out.
 No one knows me better.
 But you also know that Jack Donaghy always wins.
 Or have you forgotten the time we played battleship?B Remember A-8? You peeked.
 Why are you here, Jack? To propose something, something no one would ever expect An alliance.
 Think about it.
 How much time and energy have we wasted with our sparring and our gravel-voiced double entendres? An assload.
 If we joined forces, we could become the greatest business power duo since Gregory Linens teamed up with Thomas n'things.
 And whatever Kaylie's offering, I'll double it.
 I'll tell you what Kaylie's offering me my mouth shut.
 Keep your mouth shut? What do you mean? I know certain things, Jack, about Kaylie's father Certain super-gay things.
 Hank's son is gay? How gay, banks, on a scale from bear hunting to hunting bears? Gay enough that Kaylie's parents have never actually had heterosexual intercourse.
 Word is Kaylie's real father is the Poole boy.
 Do you know him Frederick Poole's grandson Trevor? Very handsome, horrible personality I'm totally in love with him.
 But if Kaylie isn't really Hank's granddaughter Then she isn't actually family.
 And once she's out of the picture, you're the only choice to take over Kabletown.
 And you're gonna take me with you.
 But how do we prove Kaylie's not a Hooper? All we need is DNA.
 I've got a ton of her dad's.
 So we just need Kaylie's.
 Hi, Bev.
 It's Liz.
 Liz! Yeah, definitely, don't give me your last name, because I only deal with one person a year, so I know exactly who you are.
 It's Elizabeth Lemon.
 I've been on the agency's list for a few years now.
 I wanted to see if you got my letter updating my marital status.
 Yes.
 Congratulations.
 You've moved from the "well-meaning lesbian" pile to "found a man, comma, living a lie.
" That brings your wait time down to only four years.
 Four years? So I'll be 46 by the time I get a baby? Unless you'd like to adopt an older child.
 I can give you a six-year-old yesterday.
 Pick a color.
 I just always pictured myself getting a newborn.
 And I always pictured myself getting double-teamed by two the rocks.
 But sometimes we have to make compromises.
 Let me know if you change your mind.
 Jack, how old is too old for a woman to have a baby? Look, I have three options if I still want to start a family.
 There's the old-fashioned way, but these hormone treatments are the worst.
 And even if they work, at my age, the kid might just come out a ball of fingers.
 Steve Forbes was born a ball of fingers.
 He had the best surgeons money can buy, but you can still tell.
 So option two is adopting a baby, but I have to wait four more years.
 I'll be almost 70 when she graduates from college, which just leaves option three Adopting an older kid, but I don't think I can handle that.
 Really? Wouldn't that be easier than taking care of an infant? No.
 With a baby, you know what you're getting.
 With an older kid, who knows? For every orphan Annie, there's a 30-year-old Russian dwarf who's just pretending to be a child, according to a movie that I watched part of.
 We are both at a crossroads, Lemon.
 I have chosen my path.
 It's time you do the same.
 Hello, partner.
 What's happening here? What's happening to your left blob? It's the hormones.
 Lemon, thanks to banks, I have reason to believe that Kaylie is not her father's daughter.
 The reason being a week-long party in Stephen sondheim's sex dungeon.
 The workmanship down there is exquisite, but it took forever.
 Renovations in New York.
 The point is, when Hank finds out that Kaylie's not family My God, are you planning on telling Hank just so you can get a promotion? Not just a promotion.
 I'll be CEO.
 And I'll be NBC's head of publicity.
 You'll never see me again.
 I'll be on a beach somewhere.
 I know this is important to you, but you are off the rails, Jack.
 Thanks for the compliment, Lemon.
 Train travel's for hoboes.
 What you're doing makes no sense.
 You're teaming up with Devin? Hey, listen, I've changed, Lemon.
 The only backstabbing I do now is Well, you know.
 Every time I think we're done with that, we find another one.
 You're trying to tear apart a family.
 You're in a blood feud with a teenage girl.
 All she wants to do is talk about boys and text on her phone and, if she's like me, sit in a closet with a flashlight and memorize airport codes.
 Her phone.
 Lemon, you're a genius.
 That's how we get Kaylie's DNA.
 Teenage girls can't stop looking at their phones.
 It's like me with paintings of cannons.
 Yes, her DNA's all over that phone, of course.
 But how can we get close enough to steal it? We need a teenage girl.
 Or someone who thinks like one.
 Damn it.
 Why do I keep helping you? I'll just do anything for approval.
 I would have been a Nazi.
 Who do we know who's immature and vicious enough to Let's destroy her.
 Now, what can I do for you two gentlemen? Hello, Mr.
 Director.
 So how's the movie going? Terrible.
 Octavia won't do anything I tell her to do.
 She left early.
 She's completely unprofessional.
 I don't know, Tray.
 Sound like she acting like you.
 But I'm impossible to deal with.
 No one has ever been able to rein in my hilarious antics.
 Liz Lemon does it every day and looks great doing it.
 Okay.
 So I should just act like her.
 W.
W.
R.
X.
W.
 What would Liz Lemon do? Kaylie Hooper.
 To what do I owe the pleasure? Jack, pleasure's the name of a pony I hate.
 This is business.
 So I just happened to bump into Jenna Maroney at lunch this afternoon.
 What are the chances? What did you do to her, Hooper? Her brain's like silly putty, a toy I am too old for.
 Kaylie Hooper.
 O.
M.
G.
 It's Jenna.
 You're wearing that belt as a joke, right? Of course I am.
 Where did you get your belt? You're so cool.
 Jack is trying to destroy you and wants me to steal your phone.
 Yeah, great plan, Jack.
 Kaylie, you look so gorgeous today.
 I'm wearing a headband because you are.
 Pathetic.
 What did you think you were gonna do blackmail me? Please, I don't keep anything on my phone anymore.
 I use gadzorp.
 What on Earth is that? You're so old and out of touch, Donaghy.
 I might as well be looking at Justin Timberlake.
 I quit, cows.
 Tell your husbands I tried.
 How'd you get these DNA results back so fast? I happen to have some very powerful friends at the Maury Povich show.
 Kaylie's not Hank's granddaughter.
 I knew it.
 Would you like to Do the honors? Look how far we've come, Jack.
 From enemies to partners to who knows.
 Come on, let's get a couple of wines in you and just start wrestling.
 Yeah, the whole cabin vibe wasn't working for me.
 And this movie cannot take place in Maryland because of my ongoing feud with Cal ripken.
 Blargh.
 I'm Liz Lemon.
 I'm in charge! Nerds! I want to have a baby.
 My boyfriend is a pilot or something.
 Sandwiches.
 So you want to be the crazy one.
 Nuh.
 I'll show you crazy.
 I'm a Jedi.
 I'm not coming to work tomorrow.
 Gentlemen Actually, Jack, I've decided to continue living as Jan Foster.
 It's just in all these years as a P.
I.
, I think my greatest disguise was len wazniak.
 Tomorrow, the sun rises on a new day on Kabletown, for America and for all of us.
 To victory.
 Kaylie, how do I not seen you to join us? I know what's past your bad time.
 This party's lame.
 Let's go Kaylie.
 Devin? What are you doing here? And Mr.
 Foster? Hi honey! It's 20% of your midterm grade.
 I don't understand.
 Well, let me explain.
 Banks is on my side, and Ms.
 Foster is a private investigator I hired to follow you.
 Was a private investigator, is a drama teacher, and, as of last night, engaged to Ms.
 Siegal.
 So I know Hank Jr.
 Isn't your father.
 And now so does Your pop-pop.
 Game over, Kaylie.
 "Game over, Kaylie.
" This was too easy, Jack.
 Banks, what are you doing? FYI Kaylie is my best friend, so I sit next to her at the movies.
 Why can't she just sit in the middle? Jack Sweet, sweet Jack.
 You wanted this so badly, you were willing to believe anything That Devin would team up with you, that I wouldn't notice miss Foster sit on her testicles the other day, that my father is gay.
 I am Hank Hooper's granddaughter, Jack.
 But what about the DNA, the glass? You mean the glass I stole from Jenna's dressing room? That was Jenna's DNA, Jack.
 So Jenna is an Ashkenazi Jew with an extra "Y" chromosome? What's that, now? It was so simple.
 And when you made your move with Jenna, all I had to do was see straight through it, come back here, and plant that glass.
 You got the DNA results you were hoping for and sent them straight to pop-pop.
 This is why everyone hates you, Jack.
 We were all talking about it before at the mall.
 How do you think old Hank Hooper's gonna take that You attempting to destroy his family? There's nothing pop-pop cares more about than family.
 God, what have I done? Goodbye, Jack.
 See you never.
 Yeah, Jack.
 See you never.
 Last word.
 Yes, I suppose that's one way this could have played out.
 But there are other possibilities.
 Hypothetically, what if I never trusted banks at all? What if I knew len would be the worst mole ever? I'll tell him you said that.
 And what if I knew the DNA gambit was bait and I never sent in those test results at all? Well, that's impossible.
 I mailed them myself.
 Did you? Okay.
 So you didn't do anything at all.
 Well, that's idiotic.
 Kabletown board is meeting tomorrow, and you've done nothing to change pop-pop's mind.
 You just wasted a whole week.
 Not quite, Kaylie, because I did send something to Hank A birthday card.
 My God.
 No.
 Yes.
 You see, there is one thing Hank cares about as much as family Birthdays.
 So what did you send him, Kaylie? I'm not the one who wasted a week.
 While I distracted you, you forgot Pop-Pop's 70th birthday.
 Midnight.
 You missed it.
 And how do you think old Hank Hooper's gonna take that, Kaylie? Wonderful.
 You sent him something, right, Kaylie? Kaylie? I lost.
 After college, I'm gonna have to go into publishing and Marry a finance guy and Do charity stuff.
 Damn you, Donaghy.
 What a loser.
 You had me mail that birthday card.
 That didn't need to happen.
 That was just mean.
 What's going on here? And where did you get that sweater? Is that from chico's harvest naturals collection? Octavia Spencer got arrested for soliciting sex from an undercover police dog.
 I had to shut down my whole movie because of her.
 She turned out to be a Tracy Jordan.
 So, to deal with her, I tried to be a Liz Lemon.
 Yeah, well, being Liz Lemon isn't just about wearing a sweater and Hey, those are my glasses.
 And you popped the lenses out? No, they shattered in a urinal.
 L.
L.
, I don't know how you do it.
 I couldn't hack it with octavia for one day.
 And you've been getting amazing, thought-provoking work out of me for seven years.
 Thanks, Tray.
 I mean, it hasn't been easy.
 When you first came into my life, you were out of control, and you had horrible habits.
 Like my booger-eating? Please, let me just have one.
 I need it, baby.
 Taking care of you has been exhausting.
 You'd fight me and have temper tantrums, and I'd have to stay up all night 'cause you were sick.
 Hey, those lego men were on a rescue mission to save the other lego men that I swallowed.
 But as problematic as you were, I had no choice but to make it work.
 Elizibart, you are an amazing woman.
 Seriously, if you can take care of me, you can do anything.
 Hey, remember that thing we talked about the other day, about adopting an older kid? Well, I want to do it.
 Bitch, more than one person works here.
 Who is this? It's Elizabeth Lemon.
 Who? Action.
 Every dream begins with a Line? Dreamer.
 Action.
 You have within you Line? Strength and I got it.
 I got it.
 Line? Yo, Mizz, what's the name of that crazy-ass place we went last night? Bed bath &amp; beyond.
 We went beyond.
 And action.
 Line?   

                




                    			Really, Bev? Thank you so much.
 That is wonderful news.
 "Wonderful news"? The last time I said that was when my pet gnus learned the true meaning of Christmas.
 Classic Tracy You'll miss this.
 Anyway, that was one of the adoption agencies we're working with, and they may have a kid who's perfect for us.
 He's a three-year-old boy from Transylvania.
 Stay with me.
 His name is Dracul.
 Hear me out.
 He is a hemophiliac with a sleep disorder.
 Children change everything.
 Right now you can do what you want, but once you have kids, you have to be on their schedule, watch their cartoons, and touch their poop.
 Tracy, you still do whatever you want.
 That's right, I do.
 But you don't.
 So have fun while you can.
 Be spontaneous.
 You know, stop being yourself.
 I'm spontaneous.
 For instance, I started talking before I had an example of how I'm spontaneous.
 Nice haul, Mr.
 CEO.
 Did you get my gift? I assume it was the bottle of wine with the card, reading, "dear doritos, "what about just selling bags full of your dust? I could put it on chicken or fish.
" Obviously, there was a mix-up.
 I wrote you a very heartfelt note that said, "congratulations on becoming CEO.
 Do you know anyone at Doritos?" Well, I'm not CEO yet.
 The board has to rubber-stamp me.
 There'll be a party for me later this week.
 Then I have to drive around with my headlights off until someone flashes me.
 Then I have to Well, it's not important.
 In the meantime, I'm tying up some loose ends.
 I'm heading down to Florida this afternoon to take care of my mother's estate.
 Fittingly, she left everything to her live-in nurse, Martha The house I paid for, the silver, my grandfather's purple heart.
 It's terrible what alcoholism can do to the body.
 She really didn't leave you anything? That's not very nice.
 I loved my mother, Lemon Obviously, because of Stockholm syndrome.
 But she was, on her best day, a miserable old crone whose only joy came in sharing her unhappiness with others, even in death.
 She is the only person in the world to have sarcastic last words.
 "I just want you to be 'happy'.
" Mother, how I "miss" you.
 Anyway, I thought you might like to come to Florida with me.
 I can get you a V.
I.
P.
 pass to Universal's Harry Potter world.
 Okay, I am not some kind of "nerdery" slut.
 I like Star Wars.
 Lemon, I'm not relishing this trip.
 It would be nice to have someone with me.
 Are you coming or not? Yes.
 I am.
 How's that for spontaneous Florida on a work day? To that store that sells long-sleeve S.
P.
F.
 shirts! S07 Ep10 Florida Hey, I need somebody to sign for this water.
 No, you need a nobody to sign for that water.
 We're on TV.
 Okay, then who's in charge? Well, Liz, but she's in Florida.
 Or Pete, but he went to a line producers' convention in Albany.
 I saw him pack a wig.
 Tracy, does this mean we're in charge? Where do you want the water? I'm sorry.
 Where is Liz Lemon? She's out of the office.
 Is there anything we could help you with? We've got about Ten minutes before we've got to go watch shopping.
 Well, this does affect the two of you.
 I'm Martin Lutherking from NBC's in-house counsel.
 A former TGS employee has filed a harassment lawsuit against this production and both of you individually.
 Complainant is seeking damages in the amount of $50 million.
 Hold my calls, giant bee.
 I assume you know this woman.
 Wassername! What's her name? So these are the things your mother wanted you to have.
 The baby shoe she found after that fire.
 God, she loved looting.
 Colleen was such a lovely woman.
 Thank you, Martha, but you don't have to do that.
 I mean, you knew Colleen.
 And there's so much I miss Her kindness, her laugh.
 Her laugh, of course.
 She was the happiest person I ever met.
 Sure.
 Remind me of some of the happy things my mother would do.
 You know, tell jokes And the pranks! Her nickname here was Mrs.
 Silly.
 Tell me, Martha, how long did you work for my mother exactly? I'm sorry.
 What the hell was that? She'll miss Colleen's laughter? That woman clearly didn't even know my mother.
 This is a scam.
 She took advantage of an old lady.
 I saw this on Dateline.
 Next, we'll be holding hands in adjacent bathtubs.
 Or maybe that was a Cialis commercial it's all a blur.
 I'm calling the police.
 Thank you for calling Florida emergency services.
 If this is regarding an anaconda in a crawl space, press 1.
 If a sinkhole full of Indian bones has appeared in your living room, press 2.
 If you want to know why JAG wasn't on this week, press 3.
 If your shabbos goy Why can't we just cut this state adrift and let it crash into Cuba? We'll just solve this ourselves, like that woman on Dateline who tried to solve her sister's murder, then disappeared.
 But we won't go scuba-diving with the husband.
 Lemon, when Martha comes back, I'll distract her while you sneak around and go through her things.
 It's a caper! Who's spontaneous now, Tracy? Okay, start from the beginning.
 Well, the plaintiff's deposition alleges that No, further back.
 What kind of dinosaur was your grandfather? The plaintiff alleges that there is a widespread culture of depravity here at TGS Sexual harassment, intimidation, threats of violence.
 Her deposition is very gross.
 I'm going to use this doll to show you what Tracy and Jenna did to me.
 No, no, no! Yes.
 She's lying like a rug.
 "Rug" is an offensive term for Persians that I made up.
 We would never do that to a page Maybe that tall Asian one.
 Yeah, Miranda.
 Her hair is so thick and black.
 Please don't include me in this.
 Look, legal views this as a frivolous lawsuit.
 Hazel Wassername, aka Richard Drench, has a long history of suing former employers.
 So all we need is for everyone who works at TGS to sign this affidavit saying that they have never witnessed or been party to any inappropriate behavior.
 I once played a lawyer in a movie, so I know all about winning your son's love back thanks to a magic camera.
 Yes, movies are terrible.
 Well, don't worry.
 We'll get everyone to sign.
 We really don't want this to go to court for a number of reasons.
 You two could be personally liable for any damages.
 Hank Hooper hates any type of negative publicity like this.
 And I didn't super-duper finish law school.
 So I'm sorry about that.
 I just miss your mother so much.
 She was an angel that fell from heaven.
 Yes.
 So was Lucifer.
 Do you have a bathroom I could use? Down at the end of the hall.
 I may be in there a while because I have a gluten thing that turns my business white.
 Just go! So, Martha, tell me some more funny Colleen stories.
 Colleen had two night tables? Kama sutra? Who is "M"? Shmesbians! Where are my manners? This is Florida.
 Let me boil up a pot of hot gatorade.
 Is blue okay? Jack, bedroom Lies.
 Martha's been telling me Colleen loved children and animals.
 The only animal Colleen ever bought me was a myna bird who was later revealed to be Colleen's personal spy.
 I told that bird everything.
 No, Jack, it's not a scam.
 I think Martha and Colleen were together.
 Have you lost your mind? It's a thing.
 Men die first, and these older women are alone and turn to each other for companionship, like my Aunt Linda and her roommate, Jean.
 But they weren't lesbians.
 My God, of course they were! Lemon, listen to what you're saying.
 Colleen Donaghy was gay? She stopped watching the bruins because Derek Sanderson's mustache made him look, "like he takes his sandwich with a pickle.
" They shared a bed, Jack A sleep number bed, set to two drastically different firmness levels.
 Only an insane person would do that if they were sleeping alone.
 Insane! Martha tricked Colleen into thinking she was her friend, and of course two friends can share a bed.
 For example, Abraham Lincoln and his roommate, Joshua fry speed, slept in the same bed together until Joshua died from dancing too long at a party.
 The gatorade's on.
 While we're waiting, I DVR'd a documentary about the woman who designed all of pat summitt's blazers.
 Kenneth, we have a sign affidavit regarding this Hazel situation from everyone on the TGS crew except you.
 Look, I get it.
 I know how former lovers can have a hold over you long after they're gone.
 In some ways, I'm still pinned under a passed-out Harvey Weinstein, and it's Thanksgiving.
 But the truth is, Hazel is gone, Ken Jennings, and to prove it, we hid a camera on a gigolo friend of ours and asked him to seduce Hazel.
 Sloppy Rodney Do you know him? He has syphilis.
 Hey, baby, you want to get down? Sloppy Rodney? It's me, Richard Drench.
 I remember that ass.
 Please stop.
 Hazel isn't the reason I won't sign that affidavit.
 The truth is, I have seen a lot of inappropriate things here at TGS, and I don't want to lie about it.
 What's the big deal? Lying is easy.
 For example, there isn't a hole in my pocket I keep touching my penis through.
 See? Easy.
 Not for me, sir.
 I've lost a lot this past year.
 I went from being a page to a janitor.
 My girlfriend dumped me.
 The only thing I have left is my integrity.
 Now, you both know I would do anything for you.
 But I want you to think long and hard before you ask me to sign that affidavit, because you'd be making me give up who I am.
 Whatever.
 Sign it.
 Sign it.
 I apologize.
 We never had the need for a second bedroom around here.
 This is usually where I store my woodworking tools and the pottery I make.
 What's the problem, Lemon? They're just lumpy flowers.
 Now, I don't know who usually sleeps on which side, so I put a strawberry calcium chew on both night tables for you, Liz.
 We're coworkers, Ms.
 Edwards.
 We're not No, no, no.
 I'm sorry.
 I just assumed That's quite all right.
 A lot of people are making wild assumptions today.
 Our relationship is purely platonic, if Plato had an elderly, shut-in aunt.
 You know what Plato did have? A gay relationship with Socrates.
 Lemon, the only way you're like Socrates is you have the body hair of a Greek man.
 Are you sure you aren't married? 'Cause this seems pretty married.
 Siri, find me the nearest hotel.
 Finding hookers.
 Is that right? You don't want to go out.
 The Vietnam vets are starting to retire, and they get antsy at night around all these palm trees.
 No, that's all right.
 We can sleep together, because there's nothing weird about two friends sharing a bed, right, Jack? Of course not.
 Your pajamas have a turtleneck.
 They're from the L.
L.
 Bean maritime professional collection.
 So what way do you want to totally normally sleep together? Face-to-face, or butt-to-butt? Careful Old mattress.
 It goes without saying, Lemon, that nothing will happen in this bed tonight, and I am referring, of course, to your Digestive failings.
 I'd laugh, but I'm trying not to do the thing that you just referred to.
 Why didn't anything ever happen between us? Good God, Lemon.
 If you're trying to conjure my mother's ghost, you could just shake a jar of coins while praising Jimmy Carter.
 No, I'm not saying I wanted something to happen.
 But why didn't something happen? We've spent a lot of time together.
 We've been drunk together and day-drunk together and on the rebound at the same time, and also, you're kind of a slut.
 I did sleep with Jenna a lot during season three.
 If I were a different person, would you have hit on me? I understand what you're getting at, Lemon.
 There was a particularly youth-oriented priest in my childhood parish who went after everybody but me Even fat Ralph, and he ate his boogers.
 I felt so unpretty.
 No, this isn't about appearance, Jack.
 Did nothing ever happen between us because I'm not fun? Good God, Lemon.
 Obviously, our relationship, however you define it Mentor/mentee Sister-ployee/work oracle Is more interesting than some dating scenario.
 And obviously, to ruin what we have with a tawdry, yet expert sexual encounter would've been a mistake.
 Obviously, but is it the kind of mistake that I should have made? Tracy told me I haven't lived.
 You're allowing Tracy to criticize your life choices Tracy Jordan? Now what? But he's right.
 I haven't done anything impulsive ever.
 I don't have any tattoos or broken bones.
 I've never been high, except for that choir trip to Montreal where I accidentally ate a pound of marijuana.
 Also, maybe I was never attracted to you because you're the kind of person who finds a way to talk about herself while lying in my dead mother's bed.
 Okay.
 Well, for the record, it's mutual.
 I wasn't exactly chomping at the bit to be with a middle-aged man with crippling mommy issues.
 First of all, it's "champing" at the bit.
 Horses champ.
 And second of all, I'm not going to fight in bed with a woman I'm not even having sex with.
 Why? Is it weird? Of course it's weird.
 Lincoln was super gay.
 Thank you.
 And I don't even want to think about my mother.
 And I know those pots aren't flowers.
 They're my mother's vagina.
 Jay-Mo, I like to flouring a joke about bjork's swan dress Tired.
 I've seen dresses that look fly, but never dresses that can fly.
 I couldn't sleep at all last night.
 I've got this weird, sick feeling in my stomach.
 Me too.
 It's the same feeling I got in 1997 when that jury foreman looked at me and said, "guilty!" And I had to close my water park.
 I forgot to make an opening at the end of the slide.
 Is that what this is Guilt? I don't think so.
 I mean, what have we done to feel guilty about? We don't care that we made Kenneth lie, right? No! Come on! It's Kenneth.
 Although he has been acting a little different since yesterday.
 What? Did I miss a spot? I don't care.
 All I care about is which jazz club I'm going to tonight.
 He's broken.
 Good morning, Jack.
 You sleep okay? Colleen's myna bird told me you spent the night in the car.
 I slept fine.
 Before you leave, I wanted you to have this.
 That was taken at the wrap party for our community center's production of Grease.
 Your mother was Sandy.
 Well, the fourth Sandy.
 The first three died falling off the car during "Summer lovin'.
" I don't know the last time I saw her so happy.
 I'm glad she had you to, take care of her.
 Lemon? Jack, you need to come to Orlando and pick me up.
 I'm in Harry Potter world jail.
 Kenneth Parcell isn't signing your precious affidavit.
 That is a Christmas card from my estranged daughter.
 Tell him, Ken.
 If you've ever experienced anything inappropriate at work, just tell the truth.
 Well, sir No, Kenneth, you have something in your teeth.
 I'm just trying to lick it off.
 Let me do it.
 I'm your friend.
 Want to see a porno my cousin is in? To close a very important deal, I'm going to need to loan you to David Geffen for the weekend.
 Why do I even take birth control pills if I'm always gonna be alone? You might as well take them, Kenneth.
 You take them! Take them! Now, for days that weren't my birthday Get me Philadelphia.
 'Cause I wanted to sound cool, okay, Tucker? Fine, get me Gary Derekson.
 Well, I did it.
 I tried to live life, and it sucked.
 I came here without studying the park map beforehand, which is how I ended up in a long line that turned out to just be a crowd of people watching two owls have sex.
 Then the park started to fill up, but, I'm being spontaneous, so I tried to cut the line for the flight of the hippogriff, which is when Duncan here caught me.
 What is the point, Jack? I am who I am, and I'm never gonna change.
 I'll die full of regrets, like that time I sat next to Richard Grieco on an airplane and just let him read his Hustlers without ever telling him I was a fan.
 Lemon, you're wrong.
 People can change.
 Maybe tomorrow, maybe when you're 85, you'll find a reason to do something totally out of character.
 After all, that's what Colleen did.
 Not to make this about me, but are you admitting that I was right about your mother's late-in-life lez-out? I just can't believe it.
 I know, and a woman of color too good for her.
 No, not that.
 I can't believe she was happy.
 She was Mrs.
 silly.
 Sketch idea.
 At the end, when she said she just wanted me to be happy, I thought she was being sarcastic, because when I was growing up, I thought people who wanted to be happy were weak Hippies, Italians, kindergarten teachers.
 What am I supposed to do with this? I don't know how to be happy.
 What are you talking about? That is enough of your black Irish nonsense.
 Of course you're happy.
 It's never been the goal, Lemon.
 The goal has always been money or prestige or, when playing hockey, the goal.
 Jack, in an hour, you are flying to New York City on a private jet to a party celebrating you as Kabletown's next CEO.
 It's everything you've ever wanted.
 And Colleen is looking down on you right now, and you're happier than you've ever been.
 Of course I am.
 Hello, Beverly.
 It's just Bev, Liz.
 My mother died while naming me.
 Well, I do have an opportunity for an immediate placement.
 Really? Okay.
 There is one issue.
 It's two children A brother and a sister, and we don't want to split them up.
 Two? Boy, that wasn't our plan.
 I know.
 It's a lot to take on.
 Why don't you discuss it with that little action figure you're married to? No, no, we'll do it.
 Are you sure? Yes, we'll take them.
 We'll take both kids.
 There you are, Liz.
 I'm on my way up to see Jack, but as long as I'm still CEO, I want to say two things.
 One, did you get a little sun? You're glowing.
 And two, because of the lawsuit and the P.
R.
 nightmare and the den of sin you've built here, I have to go ahead and cancel TGS.
 Next Friday is your last show.
 Great news, Liz.
 Kenneth doesn't have different hair anymore.
 Liz? Liz? I showed up without a bra one day, and I was viciously harassed until I put on a shirt.
 I once saw Kenneth Parcell naked.
 It was horrible.
 His body is just a smooth beige tube with a head.
 Frank Rossitano was always trying to give me pornography that I had given him in the first place.
 I mean, what a re-gifter.
 There were these two African-American giants that were always pressuring me to join their book club.
 Can have please a glass with water? Thank you.
   

                




                    			You fail Liz.
 You let the show get cancelled, and we all died.
 No, I didn't.
 It wasn't my fault.
 When we talked about this dream, we said we were gonna be cowboys.
 Your fault.
 Your fault.
 Your fault.
 Your fault.
 Your fault.
 Your Wake up.
 Liz, wake up! Aaaah! The twins are coming.
 What? Yeah, I just got an email from Bev at the adoption agency.
 It's from hotjuggsbev2@adoption.
Gov.
 Guess there's another full-figured Bev at the office there.
 My God, flight 124 on January 29th.
 That's in five days.
 It's happening so fast.
 We don't even know where they're coming from.
 Airbike flight 124 out of Houston's George Bush airport.
 It's not my airport! Let it go, Liz.
 Wait, if they're coming from Houston, they won't have winter clothes.
 They're gonna need jackets and hats.
 How big is an eight-year-old's head? I'm thinking, like, a bowling ball? No, bowling ball's too small.
 It's like a basketball.
 A small basketball that you win at the fair.
 You're describing a bowling ball.
 Okay, kids coming, show to save, DVR at 98%, but I'm just never in the mood to watch Treme.
 Okay, first things first I'll watch a bunch of tremes.
 I'll go to the sporting goods store and measure balls.
 I'm gonna need a cloth tape measure.
 To Ikea! Hey, sorry I late, but Treme gets good if you stick with it.
 So is TGS safe now? Will you uncancel us? Lemon, I can't start my tenure as CEO by reversing my predecessor's decisions in order to help my weird buddy.
 But while I can't help directly, I have, through back-channels Like B.
E.
T.
? Back channels.
 I have secured you a lifeline.
 The Kabletown board has agreed to hear a presentation from you tonight to convince them that TGS is worth more alive than dead.
 Perfect.
 I've sold this show once before you were even here, and I crushed it.
 It's a topical sketch-comedy show for a little demographic that's, I don't know, I'll take that nod as a yes.
 Lemon, this is not a question of selling your creative vision.
 Thanks to Hazel's lawsuit, TGS has cost this company millions of dollars.
 Okay, well, we can make cuts.
 You'll have to do a lot more than trim the budget, Lemon.
 Your show can't cost NBC any money at all.
 That's impossible.
 Impossible? Would any of your female heroes say that? Would Amelia Earhart or dian fosse or Joan of Arc? Boy, women who try to do things sure get killed a lot.
 You know what? I can do this.
 I've saved the show before, and I ain't afraid of no board! Lemon, expensive musical cues are exactly the sort of thing you can't afford anymore.
 S07 Ep11 A Goon's Deed in a Weary World You've got Lemon.
 Make lemonade.
 Hey, when do you think you're gonna be home? 'Cause we gotta do some power nesting.
 Upstairs, I want to paint a mural of Houston for the kids, but I'm terrible at drawing swamp humidity.
 I don't know, Criss, late.
 I'm sorry.
 I'll make it up to you.
 Sex on the couch? Sex on the couch? That's a good one, Criss.
 I'll call you later.
 Okay.
 Listen up, jagweeds, it's go time! We are at Defcon 5 here.
 The lowest level of defense preparedness? Fantastic.
 Have you dudes ever been to deafcon, the comic book convention for deaf people? Man, if you're a dude who can hear, you are just knee-deep in This is serious.
 Our show is cancelled! Now, we all need to pull together, wing to wing, and oar to oar.
 Fine, I'll Skip to the end.
 And that little boy's name was Marshall Mathers.
 So who's with me? LL, did you save the show yet? 'Cause j-mo and I have a new problem.
 Last night at a party, we urinated into the same fountain during a lightning storm.
 And I think we switched brains.
 No, I haven't saved the show yet.
 I cannot save the show without all of us stepping up.
 We get one shot at this.
 Tonight.
 We have to do a sample show, so you guys need to start writing.
 We have to rally our fans, so you two are doing press all day.
 I'm glad the band U2 is doing press all day.
 Jenna, quick, run, before Liz Lemon realizes what I did.
 Do you think this is a joke? If TGS goes away, you are actors without a show.
 And, hornberger, you and I are gonna slash the budget like we've never slashed it before.
 Are you ready? My whole life has been building to this moment.
 Has it really? God.
 Yeah.
 You wanted to see me, sir? No.
 I wanted to see Kenneth the page.
 Kenneth the page.
 That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
 Some say he's dead, but others hear his name on the wind.
 We don't have a lot of time here what do you say? I can't say no to these colors.
 I bleed blue and gray.
 Especially where I stepped on that nail.
 Excellent.
 I've got a V.
I.
P.
 tour group coming in, and I want my most experienced page to lead it.
 Now, who will be on this tour? I like to cater my presentation to the audience.
 For example, if they're Japanese, I'll make sure we accidentally walk in on a blonde woman peeing.
 Kenneth, you'll be showing around the five final candidates for my old job at NBC.
 Now, they think this just a formality before the final interview, but the tour is the final interview.
 It's an old G.
E.
 trick.
 You can only truly judge a man who doesn't know he's being judged.
 It's like NBC's TV version of Willy Wonka, starring Bob Uecker.
 I do admire Wonka.
 He's a true capitalist.
 His factory has zero government regulations, slave labor, and an indoor boat.
 Wonderful.
 During the tour, the candidates will drop their guard and show their true selves without even knowing it.
 And then you choose the one who's purest of heart.
 What? No.
 Kenneth, this is broadcast television.
 It's a nasty, ruthless business.
 No, sir.
 It's a magical, Ruth-filled business! It's dying, and its leader needs to be a grave robber who'll strip every last bauble off the corpse.
 I'm getting concerned about who we're gonna pick here.
 There is no "we", Kenneth.
 You're giving a tour.
 I'm picking the next president of NBC.
 Understood? Yes, sir.
 Of course Not.
 All the right things we have to do to make the show cheaper, gut the crew, no more taped pieces, fire Danny, scrap all the sets, and shoot everything on greenscreen.
 No.
 Greenscreen always looks so fake.
 Yeah.
 But to actually break even, we need somebody to sponsor the show.
 What, then I'll have some executive from Nokia giving me notes? You wish.
 We couldn't get them before the lawsuit.
 Right now, our only advertisers are NBC.
com and a German guy who wants to eat somebody.
 And even Gunter's having doubts.
 Okay, so I need to find someone to put their name on the show, and I can't be picky.
 Whatever it takes.
 I get it.
 You need a sugar daddy.
 So dazzle me.
 Why should Bro Body Douche get in TGS's panties? Well, Broseph Sup? I think TGS and Bro Body Douche would be tight.
 Totes? Nah mean? No homo.
 Mos def.
 So jeah? Look, Betty, I don't know if it is jeah.
 TGS, it sounds like a news Channel, or an STD you know I've got.
 We could change it.
 We're open to anything.
 That's what you said look, don't get me wrong.
 I like Tracy Jordan.
 Dude's a baller.
 I like that you've got a slut on the show, even if she is a little boned out.
 And I love the sexual harassment thing.
 Noice! But if you're gonna get in bed with the douche, it's not just gonna be the tip.
 This is senior year.
 We're go need creative approval, brand mentions.
 And the whole tone of the show needs to be more Have you ever seen the porn version of Transformers? Blorch! Look, do we have a deal? Almost.
 It'd be weird if my show were created by a woman.
 So could your credit be Todd Debeikis? It's in honor of my frat bro.
 Died during hell week after passing out in the trough.
 I went to Syracuse.
 Never-knew-my-dad! God.
 Liz is wrong, right? If the show goes away, we'll be fine.
 Yeah, I got some stuff on the back burner.
 Left unattended long enough, the house burns down Insurance money.
 I mean, lots of people got more famous after their TV shows have ended.
 Like George Clooney.
 We just need to have our next great roles lined up.
 Like how, after E.
 R.
, Clooney had dumb, gay Batman.
 But parts like dumb, gay Batman come around once in a generation.
 If TGS goes away, what are the chances that there'll be two perfect roles, one for each of us? But we don't need two roles if we play siamese twins! One is the president.
 The other's Santa Claus.
 And they're both in love with the same woman Elvira! Tracy, Jenna.
 So I hear you're rallying fans to save your show.
 Tell me, what's going on with TGS? Actually, kristy, we'd like to talk about our amazing upcoming project.
 It's a movie called Heads of state.
 Colon The rise of doctor Ronfulus.
 The third floor is also home to NBC news.
 Fun news fact.
 The Today show was originally designed to entertain prison inmates whose IQs were too low for them to be executed.
 What I think is a fun fact is that the Todayshow is NBC's most profitable news program.
 "news funtertainment" with very low overhead.
 We pay most of our hosts in white wine.
 But I'm wondering, is there a way to make it even more profitable? More of a party atmosphere.
 Food segments where you could order the food.
 Show it again later on e!, but have gay guys make fun of it.
 I guess, for some people, the today show is about money.
 But for me, it's about America starting its day together.
 And it's about seeing your friends Matt and Savannha, and your Butler Al.
 I watch theToday show.
 This morning, out on the Plaza, Al made a classic weather pun.
 Janu-where is the snow? Yes.
 Pure of heart.
 Kenneth a word.
 Was I not clear earlier about your role I this process? I am sorry, sir, but this is bigger than both of us.
 It's NBC.
 "We comedy.
" Kenneth, it's "we peacock comedy.
" You say the peacock.
 What? That's insane.
 I will continue with this tour myself, Parcell.
 Your services are no longer required.
 Hey, I'm sorry.
 I forgot you called.
 Liz, are you in favor of our kids having a trampoline, or do you hate fun? What? No trampolines.
 They're death traps and hymen demolishers.
 You know what happened to me.
 Okay, you know Tramp World, that place we thought was a peep show? It's actually an awesome trampoline store.
 And Ladarius here gave me this pamphlet.
 Did you know that every year more people die from disease and accidents combined than from just trampoline accidents? Is this why you called me six times during my meeting? Gee, sorry.
 Just trying to include you.
 I thought we'd do all this stuff together, buying toys and gender-neutral toothbrushes.
 I mean, tramp world is all couples.
 I'm the only single guy here, Liz, except for Ladarius, whose wife died in a trampoline accident.
 I'll call you back.
 Stop.
 I hate it.
 Okay, Liz, we're about to start writing.
 I swear! No, of course you haven't done anything.
 Why would I ever think that you would? We did something, LL.
 I play Gretchen Vanderhausen, a sexy, 20-something president.
 I play her siamese twin Nick, a down-on-his-luck but muscular Santa Claus.
 The movie is being directed by Michael Ba io, Scott Baio's uncle.
 It comes out 13-13-13, which is January 13th, 2014.
 And the theme song will be, like, rap breakdown! Twins, twins, twins, twins I know what you're thinking, Liz, but it is possible to have twins who are different races.
 I saw it on Maury.
 It was a episode entitled, my obese toddler did my stepfather's makeover.
 We have two hours to save the show! But I guess I'll just do it alone, again! I'll ignore everything that's going on in my life and save your jobs for you.
 Just one question, out of curiosity What would it take I just remembered, I gotta leave early.
 What would it take for you people to ever step up and help me? Ever! This is Studio 6 H.
 Do you know what's been shot on this stage? TGS, the Joey Montero show, the Lovebirds.
 And the moon landing.
 Right this way.
 Hello, young man.
 Damn it! My name is C.
B.
 Essington.
 Now, listen to me carefully because I have a moral quandary for you.
 In Jack Donaghy's office, there's a brand-new script for a show that will change television.
 If you steal it for me, I promise you riches beyond your wildest dreams.
 What? No.
 Parcell! He past the test, sir! He refused to betray the network by stealing the script for that show about the catering company! Welcome to a world of magic Kenneth, you are very close to being back in a janitor's uniform.
 Please, no.
 That fabric was made from toilet-clog hair.
 And there is nothing in the world that means more to me than this uniform.
 You know how much I love this place, sir.
 You do peacock peacock.
 So please listen to me when I tell you Mr.
 MacGuffin here is the man for the job.
 Actually, Kenneth, I agree.
 Charlie, tell Kenneth here why you know so much about NBC.
 Well, you have to know how something works if you're going to strip it for parts.
 What? Broadcast television is dying.
 The only move is to shut down the network, pull the copper out of the walls, and turn this building into a forever 21.
 That's what you would do to NBC? At some point, you gotta turn the horse into glue, Ken.
 That is a waste of delicious dead horse.
 Mr.
 Donaghy, don't do this.
 He may have a fancy degree, and know lots of business terms, like "meeting" and "envelope.
" But if all he cares about is the bottom line, he's not right for the job.
 Kenneth, you also just described me.
 Are you saying I wasn't right for the job? No, sir.
 You were not.
 I know you don't mean that.
 Kenneth? Awkward! What am I looking at? I'm just hair and eyes.
 It's perfect.
 Pete, a word? I told you, we have to do everything on greenscreen.
 You're the one who wrote- all this says is "what if the jolly green giant was horny?" It's a note from our sponsor.
 Booyah! Wait, what is that? Where's the band? We can't afford a band Or a union crew.
 So what, we're using scabs? You're not my girlfriend.
 You're nobody's girlfriend! This is a disaster.
 I think it's awesome, but full disclosure, I just drank ayahuasca.
 Not a good time, Criss.
 You still at the office? Did you not get my messages? I haven't had a second to do anything.
 Do you know what I had for lunch today? Two pieces of pizza, a garden salad, a cup of soup, this cookie thing with a jelly center.
 I'm at JFK, Liz.
 The kids land in an hour.
 What? Bev's email had it backwards.
 They're not coming in on 1/29 on Flight 124.
 They're coming in on 1/24 on Flight 129.
 My God, they're coming.
 They're coming, Liz.
 The Kabletown board, they're on their way up.
 Ii can't go.
 I can't leave work.
 No, what are you talking about? You have to.
 Compromises, Criss.
 Okay, so I won't be there when we meet our kids for the first time so what? I'll be around for lots of other stuff.
 I mean, how important is being there this one time? It's really important, Liz! You know that.
 I also know that everyone here is counting on me to save their jobs right now.
 And nobody else can do it because, damn it, this is Bro Body Douche presents the Man Cave, and I am Todd Debeikis! No.
 Guys, I'm worried about Todd.
 I'm extraordinarily busy, Kenneth.
 I assume you've made your decision.
 Yes, I have.
 Very well.
 But you should know that I refuse to watch this network get torn apart.
 Kenneth You Kenneth! As much as it pains me, I have no choice but to quit the page program.
 So shines a goon's deed in a weary world.
 Kenneth.
 Seven years, and I've never gotten it right.
 Every show I was sure would succeed failed.
 I mean, the monkey was funny, damn it.
 And then, when I tired to tank the network so Hank would sell it What's that now? I actually made it better.
 Homonym is the first U.
S.

 Yekee deegast.
 Khak to saret! Unlike every other place I've ever worked, this business makes no sense.
 And it doesn't matter if you went to Harvard business school or Your college mascot and president was a bear in a hat? Exactly.
 This industry is totally irrational.
 So if all my credentials and degrees and experience don't matter, that means the only qualification for this job is loving television.
 What are you saying, sir? I'm saying I'm finally going to do something for this network that I know is right.
 You like NBC, don't you, Kenneth? I think it's the most wonderful place in the whole wide world.
 Good.
 Because I'm giving it to you.
 The whole thing.
 You're the next president of the National Broadcasting Company.
 Welcome to the Man Cave.
 TV for your peen.
 R.
I.
P.
, Todd.
 Why isn't he in costume? Ladies and gentlemen of the Kabletown board, I quit.
 So do I.
 What the hell are you doing? They're replaceable we can get David Alan Grier and Miss Piggy.
 I'll tell you what we're doing, LL.
 We're finally stepping up.
 This show is a disaster.
 Except for the very moving Todd Debeikis tribute.
 Todd, we'll miss you.
 I know you want to save TGS,Lemon head, but there is no TGS to save.
 And you should be at the airport right now picking up your chili.
 Children, Tracy.
 Children? Why the hell are you still here? We knew you'd never give up, so for once, let us step up and do what we do best nothing.
 You're doing this for me? We all are.
 I quit, Liz.
 Me too.
 I quit.
 Mommy's baby quits.
 I actually quit two years ago.
 Subhas out.
 Suck it! Get out of here, lady! I hit that.
 Hang on.
 Is that them? Is that the twins? No way! So it is possible.
 Yeah, I saw it on Maury.
 Is that a camera? I'm gonna need you on my good side.
 What up, Liz Lemon? I will not be able to attend school tomorrow because of an issue with my lizard.
 That seems about right.

 Janet, shoes and socks.
 Okay, let go of the comic book.
 I'm trying to get your jacket on.
 Criss, shoes and socks! Let's go, let's go.
 No, don't forget these just 'cause you hate 'em.
 Mwah! Mwah! All right.
 Bye.
 Mwah.
 Have a good day.
 Have fun at home! "Any recommendations for the best place "to buy a girl's bike on the upper West Side? She's eight.

 Once this circle is completely filled in, we will be a perfect company.
 And then we'll be able to get even better trophy wives Halfasian ones! Jack Donaghy's office.
 You can't go in there.
 I never told you this, but I once came up late at night looking for Jack, and you were in a wedding dress dancing with one of his suits.
 Mr.
 Donaghy will see you now.
 Stayat-home Lemon.
 To what do I owe the pleasure? Did you already run out of things to do today? Pfft! What? No.
 You are.
 It's understandable.
 For the past seven years, you put out dozens of fires every day, not including the real ones Tracy would set.
 To keep away Frankensteins, which, as far as we know, worked.
 My point is, you need the outlet.
 Without work I have plenty of new outlets.
 I ran this morning for 30 minutes.
 Does that include dry heaving? And wet.
 And sure, okay, I thought I'd have a job right now, but I don't need to work.
 What about money? You knowTGS is only syndicated in Greece.
 We'll be fine.
 Criss has gone back to work.
 He has a degree in ethno-musicology from Wesleyan, so he's a receptionist in a dental office.
 And I didn't come here looking for something to do.
 I just thought I would check in on you, because you're the emotionally fragile one.
 Hogcock! Which is a combination of "hogwash" and "poppycock.
" I'm just saying, if my mother told me that everything I had been raised to believe was a lie and then died, I'd be like, "say what?" Lemon, all Colleen said is that she wanted me to be happy, and, obviously, I am.
 Take a look at my new view.
 From up here, I can see the whole island.
 A city built on the religion of capitalism, and I am its high priest, looking down on the swinish multitude.
 And even those who hate me, the unwashed socialist horde, the occupy wall streeters and the beard-havers and the bicycle riders, even they must acknowledge me As a God.
 And this makes you happy? It should.
 You know, I'm reminded of something Yoda once said.
 Dark times are these.
 Last episodes Hogcock! &amp; Last Lunch Nakamura-San, we at NBC would love to adapt your game show for American audiences.
 But we thought maybe contestants could win money instead of penis punches.
 Yo, Ken, I need you to do something for me! Ken! Tray, Ken can't do stuff for you anymore.
 He's president of the network now.
 So? He promised me he'd always be there for me, no matter what! Sometimes things change.
 And yet you still say stupid stuff to me all the time and suck at carrying boxes! Hey, Kenneth! Just thought I'd come up and say hi to the new president of NBC.
 Well, can I get you anything Chickpeas, moonshine, turtle meat? I'm good.
 You know, I was with NBC for seven years.
 And even though right now I'm concentrating on being a mom You've always had the body for it.
 At some point down the road, I do plan on getting back to work.
 Well, I hope it's with NBC, because we have hiring quotas.
 Okay, well, I actually think there might be a show in my life You know, a woman writer living in New York.
 Sorry.
 Woman, writer, New York Those are all on my list of TV no-no words.
 See, I think audiences just want to laugh and forget about their problems when they watch TV.
 They don't want to watch some angry New York crankypants make that face Exactly.
 I want to make shows that people actually want to watch Shows where a guy gets a drink thrown in his face, and then he turns to his dog and says, "don't even say it.
" To his dog! Okay, well, I think TV can be successful without sacrificing quality.
 There it is.
 Okay, well, if that's what you want, maybe I shouldn't bring my ideas to NBC.
 I'll go to cable, where you can swear and really take time to let moments land.
 You willer bevieve what just happened to me.
 I was throwing a tantrum in the makeup room.
 Where is my color? I will have you queens fired! I will tell the other gays your real ages! I'll be Ignored by my friends? No one paid any attention to Stop ignoring me! This is an actor announcement.
 The show's over, so you're not technically an actor anymore.
 How dare you, you rotting pear? I will stop being an actress when the Earth stops spinng on Kabbalah monster's fingernail.
 The only thing that's stopping is this show.
 It's beneath me, and from now on, Jenna Maroney only plays dramatic roles.
 Good-bye forever, you factory reject dildos.
 Mr.
 Donaghy! Inga, you have to warn me when we have an important guest.
 I'm afraid I'm gonna have to spank you again.
 Stupid Jonathan.
 Kenneth, I need your advice.
 Sir, I know this is my office, but it would make me more comfortable if we switched places.
 Kenneth, I've been thinking about something a lot lately, something that's never bothered me until now.
 Me too! Where are all the baby pigeons? Happiness.
 I've started to wonder if I'm happy.
 Well, sir, if you have to ask, then you're not.
 It's like when a pig says, "if I can communicate with you telepathically, do I have a soul?" And then you're like, "no.
 Duh.
 Into the slaughtering chute.
" If you're right, I have a problem.
 And every problem can be solved.

 Kabletown shares closing at a new high today.
 CEO Jack Donaghy, who rang the opening Bell last week, has emphasized the growth potential in Now I am the sensei! The parking space closest to the door is mine.
 What do we have here? Joining us this hour is my new co-host, the colonel.
 Looks like another cold one today in the midwest.
 Yeah, so bundle up, everyone.
 And if you can, get hit by a car.
 You get to spend a couple days in the hospital, and they'll give you soup.
 Nancy, I know this is unconventional, but I really think a group relationship could work.
 What you're proposing is a sin, Jack, but she is wicked hot.
 Elisa, what do you say? It would have to be a conjugal visit, because I am in a Puerto Rican jail.
 Jenna, thank you so much for doing this.
 What a thrill.
 I am just so glad to finally return to my two loves Dramatic acting and sex crimes.
 Yeah.
 Well, this first scene is super simple.
 Munch and fin find your body.
 Wait.
 What? I die? Didn't you get the rewrite? But if I'm dead, how can I become a recurring character? And if I'm not a recurring character, how will I get away with horrible stuff, like this? Let's do this.
 That's what I was about to say.
 Let's do it! Slate it! And action! Word is, cleaning lady found her Early this morning.
 Still alive.
 Who else had access? My foot hurts, but I'm okay.
 I think this injury has given me crime-solving Powers.
 It's Mind beauty.
 I'm done.
 Who is this chick? All television is beneath me.
 I will only do cinema.
 No one cares, Jenna.
 I am going to the city of angels, a veterinary hospital where I get dog sedatives that help me relax when I fly.
 Then I'm flying to Los Angeles! Good-bye forever, you soup line at a gay homeless shelter.

 Are you kidding me? Liz, you don't want to be here right now, 'cause I got to go smack that woman in the face.

 I'm the original poster.
 My God! Since when do you listen to T.
I.
? That message board is for moms.
 I thought you were a lady.
 You said you had amazing cheekbones.
 Chros, what are you doing here? I don't know.
 I just hate being at work.
 Sitting at a desk makes me crazy, so I keep getting up and getting coffee.
 Now I'm all jittery and weird and bird! So you hate work? And this mom came in with her kids to see Dr.
 Emily, and I was jealous of her.
 Her kids were so bored, I just wanted to jump over that divider and play waiting games with them, like carpet adventure.
 Or that one where your hands are spiders.
 Hand spiders.
 Yeah, so I hate work, and evidently you miss it.
 I know.
 I'm a terrible mother.
 My God, if you were a dude, you would not even be thinking that.
 It's okay to want to work.
 One of us has to.
 We just got it backwards.
 You're the dad.
 I do like ignoring your questions while I try to watch TV.
 Exactly! I should be the one staying at home.
 You should be in an office.
 That's how our family's supposed to work.
 Except I don't have an office to go back to.
 Well, so pitch something to Kenneth, like, I don't know, a show about a dentist's office where the sassy hygienist says things like, "I'm turning 30 Again.
" I will miss Tyrell.
 You know, that's exactly the kind of garbage that Kenneth is looking for.
 And for the sake of my family, I'm gonna give it to him.
 Damn it! Why did I get such a loud pacemaker? Tray, Kenneth is not coming.
 You think I don't know that? When I went up to Ken's office earlier, I saw his schedule on his assistant's pornography box! You mean computer? Whatever.
 He doesn't have meetings.
 He's avoiding me.
 What am I My son's piano recital? Put yourself in Kenneth's shoes.
 I can't! He's not here! Stop torturing me! He's running the network.
 He doesn't need you asking him for stuff.
 Whatever it is you need, we can do it.
 Unless you need us to hate the new Taylor Swift album.
 That girl has feelings.
 You're wrong, dotcom! What I need only Kenneth can do Only Kenneth! We were doing just fine before Kenneth ever got here Just fine! You wanted to see me, sir? Kenneth, since we last spoke, I've been in a spiral An upward spiral.
 That's not a thing.
 Neither is talking two catholic beauties into a delicious vanilla-caramel sex swirl, but I did it.
 And I got rid of their accents.
 Jack, porking in that prison basement was wicked awesome.
 Thank you, you two, for blowing my brains.
 So who's happy now, Parcell? Well, if you have to ask the question And answer it.
 I am You string cheese with a tooth stuck in it.
 Look at the wheel.
 Well, then smile, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I am.
 Jack? You are gonna love this, you magnificent bastard.
 Someone leaked your new salary.
 Occupy Wall Street is having a conniption.
 Really? They burned you in effigy! The hair went up like a Roman candle.
 And the democrats They don't even know what to do with themselves.
 Just look at this jackass.
 Jack Donaghy is an economic war criminal.
 If the Democratic party controlled congress, I would see to it that he was punished in the worst way possible By having to come down here and listen to us.
 God, I feel like I have a "macropenis" right now.
 Liz Lemon, how funny! I was planning to call you, and now here you are.
 Now, about our conversation earlier Yes, about that.
 You know, I've been thinking, and you were right.
 America doesn't want to see me.
 America wants to see John Hardly.
 He loves his family, but he hates the rat race.
 He's "hardly working.
" I'm so sorry.
 Pass.
 But I do have something you'd be perfect for.
 One last chance for TGS to make America Say, "what? Why?" What are you talking abo? Well, it turns out Mr.
 Jordan's TGS contract contains some rather unusual clauses, and I don't mean those two Santas I saw kissing on the subway.
 "If fewer than 150 episodes of TGS are produced in total, Mr.
 Jordan shall be paid a penalty of $30 million.
" So? Ms.
 Lemon, TGS has done 149 shows.
 So we're gonna need you to go ahead and do one more.
 I need a job, Kenneth, not one more episode ofTGS.
 You are contractually required to write and produce all episodes of TGS, so See you tomorrow? You've really changed, Kenneth.
 I don't think so.
 You look nice today.
 Shut your chin slit.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.
 Follow yellow signs to baggage claim and ground transportation.
 Excuse me, ma'am.
 Do you need a wheelchair to baggage claim? Shut it down.
 I will return to my first love Broadway! You Eastern European knockoff Mr.
 Potato heads.
 Why haven't you come to see me? Why didn't you return any of my calls? I tried, sir, but no one answered.
 I'm Tracy Jordan.
 I don't answer phones.
 Kenneth, you once made a promise That you would always be there for me.
 I know.
 I'm sorry.
 I would never break a promise.
 Good, 'cause I need you to do something for me.
 Of course.
 Just name it.
 Kenneth, I need you to take back your promise.
 Sir? I know what it is to blow up overnight.
 And I'm not talking about my gout.
 When I got big, a lot of people from my past wanted stuff from me, and, well, I don't want to be that person for you.
 So, like the snakes I kept in my dressing room, I release you.
 Mr.
 Jordan Thank you, sir.
 I think I'm gonna need a tissue.
 Am I supposed to drop this on the floor? And while we're naming things, my car ran out of gas on the Long Island expressway.
 Yes, sir.
 Okay, Jack, I need a job.
 I'm looking for six figures, eight if you're counting cents, which I fell for once before Not cool, the gap.
 I'd love to help you, Lemon, but I don't think I can.
 I resigned as CEO of Kabletown an hour ago.
 What? Why? Because I felt nothing.
 I got the job.
 I pissed off my enemies Pelosi, Maddow, Baldwin.
 It should have been the greatest moment of my life.
 No, no, no.
 No, no.
 Eyes off the window.
 Focus on Lemon.
 What am I gonna do now? I could try and help you make some calls and see what bridges I haven't burned.
 But I'm not going to, for your own good.
 Work is never going to make you happy, Lemon, and anyone who tells you differently is a fool.
 Are you kidding me? What have we been talking about for the last seven years? I don't know anymore.
 For the first time in my life, I don't know what I need.
 Maybe I'll buy a boat.
 My God.
 This whole time you've been telling me how to run my life, you didn't know what you were talking about.
 You're just an alcoholic with a great voice.
 Careful, Lemon.
 You're playing with fire.
 You made me buy into this whole life.
 When I met you, I was perfectly happy with what I had Eating night cheese and transitioning my pajamas into daywear.
 You're the one who told me to want more.
 And now, when I need you most, you're bailing on me? You're an adult, Lemon.
 You didn't have to listen to me.
 Really? When was that an option? Look, if you want someone to blame, blame yourself.
 You're the one who wormed your way into my brain with your endless handwringing and feelings.
 I used to be a shark, and then you "unsharkulated" me.
 I called you up here for one meeting seven years ago, and you kept coming up.
 So we ruined each other? Good to know.
 You know, it's for the best that my show is over and you've quit and we're all going our separate ways.
 I guess you and I were just a boss and his employee.
 And now we're not anymore.
 Yes, that pretty much sums it up.
 There! You're no longer special to him.
 Get out! Get out of our lives! Yes! Could you help on that Pete? This last episode is gonna be a hot mess.
 How so? If TGS doesn't do one more show, Tracy gets $30 million.
 NBC the same company that suggested we get flush buddies to save water.
 Liz, Tracy has landed.
 Of course he has, because if he didn't He'd be in breach of contract and wouldn't get the money.
 Which means he's gonna try to find another way to ruin the show.
 Seven years, and Tracy never changed.
 Well, people are who they are, Liz.
 This is Dan Silversmith with Carolina Mutual.
 I can't talk right now.
 I'm with a customer.
 Well, whatever sideways nonsense Tracy tries to pull, I'm gonna hold him down.
 I'm gonna hold him down like that machine Kathy Geiss invented that hugs old people.
 My God, this will change elder care forever.
 Whoops.
 Nope.
 Hello, Tracy.
 So one last show Pretty crazy? Indeed, Elizabeth.
 I hope nothing goes wrong.
 Why would it? I mean, you're here, fulfilling your contract.
 Sure am, L.
L.
 The only thing that can stop this show is an act of God or if some genius figured out a way to stall Just long enough No! Nice try.
 Get that out of here.
 It's the final showdown, tray.
 You're gonna have to do better than that.
 The night is young.
 And neither are you.
 Okay, thank you, everybody, for coming in on such short notice.
 I know some of you have already gotten other jobs.
 Not me.
 Anyway, we have been given a second chance to end this right, on our terms.
 So What are we gonna order for our last free lunch? Momofuku! Guy Fieri's restaurant, ironically.
 Nothing, thank you.
 Cerie, whose turn is it to choose lunch today? Who is the picker? You picked last time, Liz, so alphabetically after Lemon comes No.
 Blimpie's.
 No! Come on, Lutz! Let's solve this, Frank! Hello, Lemon.
 What are you doing here? I thought you quit.
 In the cushions of my couch, I found this customer-loyalty card to a place called blazer bar, and I assume it's yours.
 Thank you.
 It's Manhattan's largest out-of-business women's blazer dump.
 Look, I didn't like the way we ended things yesterday.
 Yeah, I've got a lot of work to do.
 I'm sorry we argued, but I'm not myself lately.
 I-I quit the job I worked my entire life to get, and now I feel adrift.
 No! We're not doing this.
 Today is the last TGS ever.
 The point is, I'm going away, probably for a long time.
 I assume that's code for a billionaire's soul-searching trip to tan penis island.
 Ha.
 We're at the end here, Lemon.
 We shouldn't hold grudges.
 For your information, most of Tan Penis Island was destroyed in Sting's house fire.
 Are urged to take this storm severely seriously.
 Hey, where are you guys going? Sorry, Liz, we got to get out of here before the roads close.
 There's a "snowicane" coming.
 All of New York state, especially midtown Manhattan between Saks Fifth Avenue and the Variety Deli.
 Aw, no.
 That's right where we are.
 According to the national weather service, you should, and I quote, "leave work, get in your purple Bentley, "and be home with your sharks "before the tristate area gets slammed "by wh is ating called 'snowicane' white lady name like dorva or something.
" Everybody back to work.
 Aw, jeez.
 What did you do to Al Roker to make him do that? Let's just say his wife is on the board of a children's hospital, and they need a celebrity to host their annual gala, and I threatened to do it.
 Do you understand how selfish you're being? Our crew has been together for seven years, and tonight is everyone's chance to say good-bye! So get up on that stage and cut the B.
S.
! But I promised Barbra Streisand I'd never stab her again! Jenna You've been friends with Lemon for a long time.
 She and I had an argument yesterday.
 Really? Did Liz scream in your face? Did you pin her up against the wall? Were your shirts wet with rain? I mean, obviously we've had disagreements before, but this Feels different.
 After tonight, I feel like Lemon and I could go our separate ways and never see each other again.
 Is that crazy? Not really.
 You know Liz.
 She can hold a grudge.
 She did want me to cancel Top Chef because Colicchio's lunch place changed the toppings on her favorite salad.
 And with people, forget about it.
 She's never stayed friends with an ex.
 When Conan dumped her, she dropped him forever.
 Hey, Liz.
 Come on, you can't pretend I don't exist.
 We dated for a year! We were gonna lose our virginity to each other! Now I'll never lose it! And her friends She'll cut people off for doing nothing.
 I'm afraid to even tell her that I frenched her dad on new year's.
 I don't know what to do.
 I've lost so much already.
 The past few months have been really hard.
 And now Lemon! Did the doctor that prescribes your antidepressants go to jail too? You see, I don't have that many people in my life.
 I spent Christmas alone in the Hamptons, drinking scotch and throwing firecrackers at Billy Joel's dog! I'm just in a really bad place, and I don't know how more I can take! Daddy, please stop crying.
 Okay, how about this? Yesterday a bunch of us came in to clean out our desks, more than half of us.
 Yes, a quorum.
 And you weren't here, Lutz.
 And lunch rule precedent stipulates that disputes will be resolved by picking a new name.
 Toofer, the can! Gladly.
 What the hell? It's stuck to me.
 God, and it's Lutz! Why's it so sticky? I wrote it on flypaper.
 I'm five steps ahead of you, you sons of bitches! Blimpie's.
 Liz, have you seen Jack today? No.
 He just came into my dressing room and started crying.
 He's in a really bad place, like when Mickey Rourke Okay, I can't do this anymore.
 I've never met Mickey Rourke.
 What do you want me to do, Jenna Shut down the show to make Jack feel better about bailing on me? I'm just really worried, and if you won't do anything, I will.
 On behalf of the network, Ms.
 Maroney, I think you should sing at the end of the show tonight.
 Wonderful! I'll need ten pianos.
 Good luck with, Jake.
 Does everybody have to be crazy today? Beloved coworkers! Life It goes by so fast.
 We barely look at each other.
 I didn't realize all this was going on.
 Good-bye.
 Good-bye, world.
 Good-bye, long-hair guy.
 Good-bye, Richard Esposito.
 Go home to your wife and eight beautiful children.
 You're all so beautiful.
 What the wha? Guys, I know I don't normally say much, but What, woman? Speak! Well, officially, the show was canceled two weeks ago.
 So isn't this technically season eight? Which means we start over at the beginning of the alphabet.
 So the new picker is Me! What? No! Lutz isn't first! You changed your name to "Aardvark"? That's insane! Puppies.
 So have you picked out a song for tonight, Ms.
 Maroney? A perfect song.
 As I'm sure you know, I have returned to my first love, Broadway, in a musical adaptation of the film of the novel the Rural Juror.
 I'm sorry the what? At the end of act two, my character, Constance Justice, sings the title song.
 It's a tearful good-bye to her true love, Norman Blurder, the rural juror.
 It sounds emotional.
 Listen to this.
 What? What is that face? I don't know, Ms.
 Maroney.
 It just seems like you're faking it.
 Well, of course I am.
 I'm an actor.
 And acting is all cheap tricks that any child or monkey could do.
 To act drunk, you just wear two different-sized heels.
 And to cry, you just clutch a shard of broken glass.
 Ms.
 Maroney, this is the end of TGS.
 You need to show real emotion.
 Real emotion? It's not really my thing.
 Maybe if I had something to be sad about.
 Are you kidding? After tonight, you may not see any of us ever again.
 Stop trying to cheer me up.
 I need to feel sad.
 Then I guess you'll have to figure out something that you'll miss about this place.
 But maybe it's not a thing so much as a person.
 Well, that's not gonna be easy, Kenneth, considering I'm the only person who works here.
 Why are you wearing that weird necklace? I always wear this.
 I want to be buried in it.
 So, if anything ever happens to me and you can't find my body but you can find this, don't overthink it.
 Just bury the necklace and move on.
 Okay, why are you wearing Jack's watch? That's not part of it.
 Jack just gave this to me.
 He's been giving his stuff away all day.
 I want you to have thisag o bmy hair.
 Why is he acting so crazy? He's crying one minute, happy the next, giving away all his stuff.
 Sounds like someone's got a case of the old kablooeys.
 We've all been there.
 You think Jack Donaghy's gonna kill himself? No way.
 Jack has never quit anything in his life.
 That's for you.
 Except his dream job Yesterday.
 Thing is, any fool can kill himself.
 You know what a real man does? Fakes his own death.
 But you got to be smart.
 Plan it slowly over eight or nine years.
 And then when it's go time, no big withdrawals from your bank account.
 Instead, the day before it goes down, you deposit $70.
 Why would a guy planning to fake his death deposit $70? He wouldn't! What the hell are you talking about? Oops, sorry.
 Work.
 Did y'all get my fax? Elizabeth Sweet, funny Elizabeth, your light always shown the brightest, baby.
 You're coming to the show tonight, right? I'll be watching.
 Not sure from where, but I'll be with you In spirit.
 Weird.
 Come on, Tray, leave the dancers alone.
 What's going on? Why aren't you smiling bravely while Tracy tells you your butt looks like two slippery hams? Where's Tracy? We have no idea, Liz.
 I've been so distracted lately.
 Grizz just found out his uncle left him a bed-and-breakfast outside Santa Fe.
 I'm gonna be a real fish out of water.
 What are you talking about? What what is that? Does everyone see that? Okay, whatever.
 I know you know where Tracy is.
 Did he promise you some of the $30 million? Yes, he promised me $1 million.
 $20,000.
 Wait.
 What? Okay, that's it.
 Tray is exactly where you think he is, Liz.
 It's the closest thing he has to hiding out in a church.
 It's 5:00.
 Where the frak is our lunch? We can't break him, Liz.
 He's not human.
 Why are you doing this to us? I'll tell you why! Because for seven years, you have yelled at me and turned the lights out on me when I was in the bathroom and written on me while I was sleeping, 'cause I was Lutz Dumb, old, uncool, part-inuit, bisexual, Well, today I am the picker! And I want you to feel what I felt for the last seven years Anger and disappointment and regret! And when that sandwich slides out of you in a week, look at it, because that is Lutz's revenge! Cerie, for lunch today, I would like to pick Blimpie's.
 No! Cerie, Sushi from Nobu 57, dessert from make my cake in Harlem.
 I'll be back.
 I hope.
 Yeah, you're not that young either.
 Get down, please.
 Give it up for Liz Lemon, everybody! The least molested person in here.
 I don't even get your play here, Tray.
 You're in breach now.
 You stay here, you don't get the money.
 If you think it's about the money, you're even dumber than I look.
 So you're just doing this for no reason at all For the fun of ruining everyone's chance to say good-bye? I'm doing this because I don't want to say good-bye to everyone.
 Anybody who's ever left me in my life just left My dad going to get a pack of smokes and never coming back, all those Foster parents talking about adopting me and never did.
 I don't want tonight's show to happen because I don't know how to say good-bye, Liz Lemon.
 Now onstage, feast your eyes on the skank train! Boy.
 Okay.
 Look, tray, it's not good-bye forever.
 I've enjoyed working with you, and I'm sure we'll get to do it again sometime, and we're all gonna stay friends.
 Sorry.
 Is that the white lady's way of saying, "I'm going out to get cigarettes"? 'Cause that good-bye was atrocious.
 Fine.
 Well, I guess there's a reason people don't say honest good-byes Because when stuff is coming to an end, people freak out and they act crazy.
 They pick fights, and they pick blimpie's.
 And I don't know what Pete's doing.
 So you lie to them.
 But if you want a hard-core truth good-bye Lay it on me.
 Okay.
 We were forced to be friends because of work.
 And we're probably not gonna hang out after this, all right? You'll say that you're gonna invite me to your house, and it's never gonna happen.
 And I'll see on TV that it's your birthday, d I'll forget to call.
 And I'll see on TV that it's your birthday, and working with you is hard.
 Tracy, you frustrated me, and you wore me out.
 But because the human heart is not properly connected to the human brain, I love you, and I'm gonna miss you.
 But tonight might be it.
 Brutally honest I like that.
 So you'll come do the show? I'll come back, L.
L.
 But we're gonna watch this first.
 Ride the train, ladies.
 Ride the train.
 Kenneth, what are you doing? Brian Williams needs a mirror on the floor of his bathroom.
 I guess you want that if you have a glass toilet.
 But the show's over after tonight, so what do you care? But my mirror.
 My God.
 It's all over.
 Am I crying? I have no way to see if I'm crying.
 Thank God! Last lunch No Lutz! Last lunch, no Lutz! Cupcake sandwich! Cupcake sandwich.
 Crap.
 Motherhood has made me go soft.
 Lutz, the food is here.
 Come eat Cupcake sandwich! Cupcake sandwich! God! Cover the food! Blimpie's! Cerie, you heard the man Blimpie's.
 I was thinking about what you said earlier How people get sloppy when they fake their own deaths.
 You said that.
 The trick is to wait for the right moment A day when it makes sense to have a drink or two.
 I don't know Maybe a sad occasion when something's coming to an end.
 You let people see you with the glass in your hand.
 That way, after the crash, they'll be like, "I did see him drinking.
" God, that idiot.
 What did he do? Yeah.
 That's what they'll say.
 No, no.
 No, no, no.
 Don't worry, Lemon.
 There is no cause for alarm.
 You are watching my video suicide note.
 My God.
 Try not to blame yourself.
 How were you to know that I was in such a dark place that the smallest thing For example, a close friend's refusal to reconcile Would be the final straw.
 He killed himself because of me.
 This is like what happened with my gynecologist all over again! I do have a parting gift for you, Lemon.
 His phone.
 I can track his phone.
 Go to YouTube and search "Hamlet the mini pig goes downstairs.
" "Hamlet the mini pig" No! Phone first! I'll watch the pig video in the cab.
 One minute.
 One minute to air.
 Guys, to be honest, you are nerds, and one of you is very funny.
 Good-bye forever.
 Good-bye, Petey Pete.
 I will forget you.
 I sure hope so, Tray.
 I sure hope so.
 Tracy and Jenna, please set yourselves.
 Tracy I'm really gonna miss you.
 My Bologna, in all honesty I'm going out for cigarettes now.
 And I'll be home in 15 minutes.
 Tracy and Jenna, please set yourselves for "the Hitlersons.
" My good side for camera.
 Take your places, please.
 Jack! Wait! There's so much to live for! Don't you want to know how Mad men ends? Don goes to work for Peggy! Hello, Lemon.
 What? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
 That was the idea.
 It was extreme, but necessary.
 I didn't want to be just another person on your grudge list.
 Yeah, which reminds me-why am I still seeing new Top Chefs with that bald salad-ruiner? I had ten hours to force you to confront the soul-crushing horror of a life without me.
 I didn't lie when I said I was going away.
 I'm off to discover what makes me happy.
 I have to find my bliss, which, for once, is not an acronym for "beautiful ladies in short shorts.
" How long will you be gone? As long as it takes to figure out what's next.
 Although I've only been on this boat a minute, I've already realized two things about myself.
 One I could totally be a professional boat model.
 And, two, I do know one thing that has made my happy these last seven years.
 Lemon, there is a word, a once special word, that's been tragically co-opted by the romance industrial complex.
 And I would hate to use it here and have you think that I am suggesting any kind of romantic sentiment, let alone an invitation to scale bone Mountain.
 It's a word that comes to us by way of the old high German luba, from the Latin lubere, meaning "to be pleasing.
" So I am going to use this word to describe how I feel about you in the way that our Anglo-Saxon forefathers would have used it in reference to, say A hot bowl of bear meat or your enemy's skull Split.
 I love you too, Jack.
 Thank you, America.
 That's our show.
 Not a lot of people watched it.
 But the joke's on you, 'cause we got paid anyway.
 Ladies and gentlemen, Jenna Maroney.
 This is just the start, Lemon.
 Imagine the insights months on this boat will yield.
 The next time you see me, I'll be a new man.
 Goodbye Jack Donaghy.
 Good God, Lemon.
 I just figured it all out.
 I'm turning around! Clear dishwashers! What? Clear dishwashers, so you can see what's going on inside it.
 My God, yes! Do that! It's the best idea I've ever had.
 Thank God I took that boat trip.
 Get in the car, Pete.
 Paula! I mean, who's Pete? I have amnesia! I Damn it! I practiced this! Hi, buddies.
 Wait.
 You're Sam? Don't even say it.
 I want to thank the brilliant Kevin Grisham, the amazing John Stamos, the incomparable judge Judy Scheindlin.
 Hey, what are you doing? They called my name.
 See ya later, suckers! Meep-meep! Pyung! She'll be like, "what?" Hey, Lemon Ice, could I call you back? My dad finally came back from getting cigarettes.
 Lemon, it's Jack.
 Don't forget Tracy's birthday.
 Good morning, Mr.
 Donaghy.
 I'm your new second assistant.
 Wait, you're Sam? So the whole show just takes place here at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.
 Is that right, Ms.
 Lemon? Yes, sir.
 It's based on stories my great-grandmother told me.
 I know.
 And I love it.
